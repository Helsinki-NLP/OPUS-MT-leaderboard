The social map of the inhabitants of Ivanov province is recognized as an electronic payment tool.
The changes provide for the maintenance of public passenger travel benefits.
Since 24 September, the way in which citizens travel has been organized has changed by means of a social map of the residents of Ivanov province.
As reported by the Russian press service in the field of Ivanov, the changes provide for the continuation of the travel benefit in public passenger transport and bring the social mapping scheme into line with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the Fed on the National Payment System.
At the same time, the social map of the residents of Ivanov province is recognized as an electronic payment tool.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
Thus, the replenishment limit is now set not on travel as before, but on cash, winter and summer periods not more than 400 roubles, summer not more than 800 roubles for the current month.
Social card holders would now need to track the balance of the remaining travels rather than track the remaining cash receipts issued in transport.
The cost of a concessionary trip for citizens would be 1/2 the price of the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel pays the regional budget.
The social map replenishment schedule remains the same, between the 24th of the previous month and the 23rd of the current month.
The new social map will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to maintain a detailed record of social map spending with accuracy.
In addition, it is possible to recover funds credited but unexpended.
We will also add that the scheme of mutual settlement with carriers becomes transparent, as now half the cost of travel is paid to a citizen, and the same amount pays the carrier the budget.
No commission will be charged when the money is presented on the map.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, Deputy Chief of the Ivanov region Road and Transport Department, reported that over 33 million social map trips had been made in 2014, almost 25 million in 2015.
In the regional budget, more than 470 million roubles are provided for the provision of preferential travel by citizens using a social map.
As at 1 September, reimbursement for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
During a 911 call, the teacher admitted to the murder of a friend
During a 911-voice call, almost without a good one, the teacher at Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that he needed officers to come home.
Lamb stressed that there was a "song" in the house that was alive but probably upset, and said that contact between the family members of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentis' body and a note that was carelessly written on a white sheet of lined paper: "I'm very sorry I'd like to bring everything back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the authorities who signed Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who was conducting two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had managed to travel 300 miles to a university campus, where the police believed he had shot all the respected professor of history Ethan Smidt at the door of his office.
The chief of police at Delta State University, Lynn Buford, reported that the university staff had learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made the right call at 911 shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more, and the Lamb has killed himself as soon as the police have surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the educational institution forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, members of the organs were still trying to create one picture of the motivations that had prompted Lamba.
The information shared by investigators in both parts of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to create a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students told me that they were looking forward to his classes.
The Gothia police, where Prentis died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Smidt himself included Lamba in his book, in which he expressed appreciation for the “beautiful people” with whom he had been involved in his teaching life.
Both of them were taught at the Department of Social Science and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures from both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well of Lamb, Brandon Bivers, said that he was also worried and nervous "like something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of his school year 2014-15 about how he was coping with stress.
Lamb used to ask Delta State University to give him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
He taught only two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university employment rules meant that the doctor ' s degree, which had been so persistently employed by Lamb, would not guarantee him automatic admission to his position as a teacher.
The president of the University, William Laforge, reported that he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it's obvious that Mr. Lamba had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
The police attacked the image of Lamba after his flight from Campus when he was on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb shot him with a 38 calibre gun in the backyard of his house, one mile south of his parents' house in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, reported to the coroner of Washington Métel Johnson County.
His car was still on the access road.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb came to this house, even though, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
The Lamb grew up in those lands.
Lamb has started working at a university of 3,500 students in a town with a population of about 1,200, and in 2009 he taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a doctorate degree in pedagogy science in the same spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and cheerful man.
Carla Heirston told me she was 15, and Lamba was 20 years old when she met her friends.
She and her friends went to high school, and he was a classy old guy who had been trying to teach her how to play guitar for years.
During those years, he was successful with women.
"All the girls were hiding when he was around," says Heirston, now 40, who lives in Jackson, the suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prince must have been meeting for a while by the time of events.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lighting, who lived with them in Gothia in a brick house, whose back side goes to the canal.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
The former husband of Prentis, Sean O'Stin, reported that they had divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," O'Stin said about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he wasn't dating Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentis when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played concerts from time to time together.
O'Stin told me his daughter is writing music and singing.
Prentis was a nurse working online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender and co-facilitator of entertainment programs in a glass of light at The Julep Room in the suburb of Gothie, said that he had last seen Lamba and Prentis on the evening of 5 September, when Lamb finished playing the guitar and the lip of a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious about it.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cheering up and huddled over each other.
I mean, they were both very clever.
“Smidt, who died a teacher, conducted seminars for first-year students and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America,” said Don Allan Mitchell, an English-language teacher at the same educational institution.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of student brotherhood and student self-government.
At the Delta University Campaign on Tuesday evening, some 900 people, including university professors, staff, students and members of the community, participated in a candle-burning memorial ceremony.
The wife of Smidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university chorus sang the Right Morning Star and Amazoning Grace.
The activities will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
The crisis is over.
It's a day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was assisted by the Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettitus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a statement by the police that Lamba had entered 911 service since the murder of Smidt, and that although Lamb had spoken of Prantiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they had been married had not been confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to recruit fewer staff during the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that he will not hire as many staff as he did last year for the holiday season, and that the Rys RUs will guarantee that he will provide full-time staff and temporary staff with more hours of work.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 employed during the 2014 holiday season.
The majority of jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would conduct interviews with applicants this month and would increase the number of personnel from October to December.
Although several months before holidays, the buying season is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have sufficient staff in stores and for the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about "dating" with Princess Diana
Michael J. Fox's film's premiere "Back to the Future" proved to be a grand event.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for members of the royal family to come, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and it dawned on me -- Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he told me in the trailer for the soon-to-be documentary film "Back in Time."
The film starts, and it comes to my mind that I'm literally at a distance of my arms stretched out and in one false vat of dating Princess Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about "Back to Future", includes interviews with Foxe, Lia Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemekices and executive producer Steven Spillberg.
The movie "Back to the Future" was held 30 years ago.
"To me," says Spielberg, "is undoubtedly the greatest movie ever made of time travels."
Back in Time will be available at VOD, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The Head of the United Nations states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in response to Russia's military support for Syria, states that “there is no war solution” for a nearly five-year conflict, and the increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Head once again called upon all participants, including the separate UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Mr. Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences in the Council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had “made the situation impossible”.
Mr. Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity as they had shown in addressing the issue of Iran ' s nuclear programme and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 results of a survey that shows Donald Trump isn't kidding.
Some tried to put a label on it.
Others turned away from him, taking him as a joke.
Some require a scandal.
But as some Republicans are trying to undermine Donald Trump’s position in the results of the interviews, they have failed (until).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed the advantage of Donald Trump in double-digit numbers, and some are beginning to ask seriously what this means for a real estate magnet in terms of the chances of getting a nominal.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at that time, in 2011, Rick Perry had given his advantage to Hermann Kane, who had not won one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups, such as Jeb Bush’s Political Activism, and the Economic Conservative Group of the Growth Club, recognize the untiring power of Trump and begin to deliver their dollars to challenge him.
Here are some of the figures from interviews that say that the real estate magnet is not just an intermediate phase:
The sympathetic ratings for Trump were 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump denounced his candidature in mid-June, a survey at the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive attitude toward this magnate in real estate.
By mid-July, it was 40 per cent.
It was 52 per cent early in August.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive attitude toward Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators are topping in the early stages.
A survey of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of Republicans there had confidence in Trumpus.
Two thirds of those voting for GOP would make Trump a candidate.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67 per cent of Republicans said that they had either taken “happiness” or “satisfaction” if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be upset if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say they would react “with admiration” against 40 per cent of those who say the same thing about Trumpe).
Next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republicans say that they will be “unsatisfied” or “dissolved” if the suitator, Jab Bush, becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trumpa's temperature is a problem.
While Trumpa is widely criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 per cent of Republican voters throughout the country feel that the magnet has the right temperature to be president, as the ABC News/Washington Post poll of Monday shows.
The same figure is found in the first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of Republicans think he has the same person as the chief commander, according to Quinnipics last week.
Nevertheless, 44 per cent thought he was not the person who could be effective at the post, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters said that his temperature was not appropriate for the White House, according to ABC/post.
Republic voters get used to that idea.
When they put their hats on, Republic voters think Trump is serious.
To the question of who was the most likely winner of GOP, four out of 10 said Trump was a favour, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's not the case when four out of 10 put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Total disclosure: Voters of GOP had no prior magic crystal.
At the same time, in the previous cycle, four of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, this shows that many GOP voters believe the Trump campaign is credible.
Even if the Republicans were to unite around another candidate, Trump was still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such dispersal is likely to have the advantage of Trump, while also not supporting Trump are evenly distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical competition "one-to-one" between Trump and most other republical candidates, Trump almost always receives the support of the majority.
He is ahead of Karli Fiorin by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeba Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Cassic and Chris Christi by 33 points.
He's got no one with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate he's missing?
Ben Carson drove a businessman around 19 points in the hypothetical competition "one on one".
Just over half the supporters of Donald Trump say they've changed their mind.
A new survey of CBS/NYT, conducted on Tuesday, shows that only more than half of the voters supporting Trump said they were confident of their votes.
Obviously, much could happen to change the situation, and no one could really say that he would never change his mind.
46 per cent said they would leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition for the moment is with a colleague-outside neurosurgeryr Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their mind are likely to pick Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “violent” in his campaign statement two months ago, the topic of immigration became the most relevant subject of conversation in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's feed will turn the key Latin American voters away from the republican party and prevent rebrenching.
But according to ABC/Post, conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts universal attention, Donald Trump appears to remain in the same position.
Frustration by the Government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on the support of approximately half of those who vote, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday of the new ABC/post interview state that they want a political outsider rather than a person with government experience.
And they're also offended in Washington.
A survey of Das Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with the activities of the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 per cent “unsatisfied” and 21 per cent “in rage”.
The Government will decide on the fate of pension indexes in October.
The Vice-Prime Minister, Olga Holdec, stated that the Government was now looking for options for implementing the Pension Indexing Act in 2016 to the real level of inflation, and transmitted it to the WG.
She noted that a solution should be found by 8 October, at the time of the introduction of the draft budget for the following year to the Government.
In addition, the Cabmine is discussing the option of prolificing a decision on the freezing of Russia ' s accumulated pension.
The hungry man noted that the pension savings amount to 350 billion roubles.
Approximately the same is true for the next year ' s full pension index.
According to the Vice-Prime, there is not yet a final solution to the question of who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
The hungry person is of the view that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for him.
The media reported earlier that two options for public budget balance were being considered in the booth.
Why are they often irritated and redished?
In response, the phthalmologist Tatiana Levashov said:
Our eyelids are broads protecting the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting the regular cleansing of the age, we often contribute to the development of blfarite.
Exit simple:
Don't triple your eyes with dirty hands, carry with you a special wet napkin for the century;
At least 1-2 times a day, cleanse the land of harmful substances stored in it.
Cleaning procedures do not need to be complemented by heat compresses of curving herbs (shalphea, Roma women) that are chewing a dense secret of saline glands and then by a massage of the edge of the century, which should be carried out by circular movements of the pillows of the fingers;
Do not use alcohol-containing products in washing the makeup.
They dry and decompose the skin and add to the secret of salivary glands.
Phanyan claims that Korean cores created a nuclear warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the Yongben nuclear reactor, was operating “at full power”.
This was reported on the country’s Central Telegraph Agency website.
It is noted that the DPRK is at any time prepared to respond to “aggression and U.S. nuclear threat”, and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “in terms of quantity and quality”.
The last nuclear-weapon test was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, no plans have been made to resume the full operation of the reactor since then.
Phanyan claims that he was able to create an atomic warheads.
The DPRK has also tried medium- and low-range missiles on many occasions, writing Polit.ru.
Zhirinowski demanded that the reference to the fraternal peoples be deleted from the Russian gymna.
The leader of LDP, Vladimir Girinowski, believes that the reference to the alliance of fraternal peoples should be deleted.
He said that during the State Duma meeting, he said “Rusian News Service”.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"The longest giant in the world, not even athletes can bear," said Zyrinowski.
The delegation believes that it is necessary to remove all the four parties in which the line is located:
In the summer of 2014, Girinowski stated that the current giant should be replaced by "God, the king," and that the Russian tricolor would be replaced by an imperial flag, writing Polit.ru.
Assad called upon all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
President Bashar Asad of Syria called upon all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe is to deal with the refugee problem, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question was not that Europe accepted or did not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem needed to be addressed.
If Europeans care about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That is our view on this issue.
"That's the essence of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue to engage in dialogue for consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible as long as people are killed while the bloodshed continues and people are not fully safe.
“So we can reach consensus, but we can't realize anything until we win terrorism in Syria”, Assad emphasized.
We will recall that during this year some 500,000 migrants, including those from Syria, arrived in the European Union.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world was the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that thousands of extremists from the “Islamic State” group may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization prohibited in Russia may use the situation to establish their own cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
German city dwellers had a festival for refugees.
In the last month, Germany had become a refugee reception leader, although it had recently strengthened border control to contain them.
The authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts call large numbers.
Since early September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
Jenny Hill's BBC Correspondent visited Darmstadt, where migrants receive a very warm reception.
Jeremy Corbin debuts matters to the Prime Minister
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut at the session of the Prime Minister is expected with great anticipation
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, is about to address the Prime Minister for the first time at a session with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak first of the six issues raised in the afternoon; his statement is likely to be followed closely by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he might miss certain meetings by leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary trial of Mr. Corbin as leader; it will take place after he has appointed a shadow cabinet and spoken at the annual Tread Union Congress on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the leader of the Labour Council stood silent during the execution of the national hero on Tuesday, during the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of Britain, brought criticism on the part of a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several headline articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the State gymn attracted attention
Mr. Corbin's Spokesperson stated that he was “standing in respectful silence” and acknowledged “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in Battle for Britain”.
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the shadow office, told Newsnight on BBC 2, that he would advise the Leborist leader to sing the national anthem “independent” from his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to join Mr. Corbin's team, expressing differences on economic, defence and international policy issues, while less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Branth said that political differences would also be “crushed” in the Labour Party following the appointment of Mr. Corbin to the European Union and the Government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Tred Union conference that the Labour Party had amended the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that there was “full clarity” in the party that she had been in opposition only to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from Pound26,000 to Pound23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, with whom David Cameron will meet at the “Courier's Box” in the past 10 years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Leader of Labour, who has promised a different approach to politics, states that he has “involved collective resources” in order to gain ideas for Mr. Cameron's questions and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from Ailington North stated that the Prime Minister ' s questions were causing undue confrontation and that he would refrain from inflammatory responses and colloquial exchanges, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Igle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him with a Prime Minister when he was absent, for example when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also expressed the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor if possible, saying that he had addressed the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Berkow, to discuss the issue.
As leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to move away from the political style of “marmarine balagana”, often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but acknowledged several years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have become a key indicator of the leadership's views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires major reforms.
"Boeburg" Young homeless people trained as photographers
Johannesburg Business Center is a difficult place for the homeless.

Pound2 is increasing as wages rise in Great Britain
The dollar grew against the rising wage in Britain, and the FTSE 100 index was raised by the proposal to purchase SABMiller.
From May to June, British earnings, less bonuses, grew by 2.9 per cent compared to last year ' s similar period.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009 and has been seen as a carryover to earlier projections of possible growth of boilers.
The PoundK has grown by more than 1 per cent in relation to the dollar of $1.5505, and by 0.84 per cent in relation to the euro of €1,3730.
FTSE 100 increased to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general terms, SABMiller shares have grown by 20 per cent, thanks to the offer of purchase from the competitor AB InBev.
The deal would unite the world’s two largest beer companies, collecting brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares increased by 0.9 per cent against encouraging news from a competing group of producers of the Richemont class.
Recent sales data for Richemont exceeded expectations and showed that sales in China -- the key market for Burberry -- had begun to grow again.
Glencor shares grew by 5 per cent after the mining giant declared that it was able to receive $2.5 billion through equity, which was done in the framework of the debt reduction strategy.
The stocks of the paper and packaging group Mondi were index leaders - by 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs had reduced the group's rating to sell.
The JD Sports shares grew after the sports clothing company reported an 83 per cent increase in profits prior to six months' taxation to Pound46.6 million.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages can interfere with expansion
The Executive Director of JD Sports, Peter Kaughill, says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means “great purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in labour costs, he says.
Costs could have affected plans to expand JD Notes, adding that could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metasash is launching a bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi's pressure
Metash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi pressures in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up food supplier launched a campaign to protect the market share of the IGA riteilers in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of Aldi 700 million dollars coming.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 shops in South and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand by marketing in leading media and social networks and at Adeleide Show-type events.
The campaigns are joined by Ritlers and IGA suppliers, such as an ice cream manufacturer from Dansborough, who offers degusting at IGA stores, and shopowners selling discount tickets to permanent customers at the soccer League of South Australia.
It is expected that Metash will reveal more details of his protection strategy on 29 September, the day that this wholesale supplier of food, alcohol and business goods will spend its annual day on investor strategies.
There are a lot of branded shops in South Australia and Western Australia, accounting for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and for higher returns than the Metash IGA network in Eastern States.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known to be supporters of conventional routes, so the market is more favourable to R & D fans than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in UA and 24 per cent in WA, compared with about 14 per cent in Eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will eat 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of their first shops, taking all the players present, but mostly independent Ritlers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at the Morgan Stanley, believes that Ritlers IGA may lose 360 million dollars a year, and Metcash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA and 30 shops in WA next year, with sales of $500 million and $600 million in those markets, respectively.
The loss of profits and sales of food at high fixed cost Metcash could cost companies about 13 million incomes before paying interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat considered.
At the same time, Metash is losing market share in Eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Colles, and this is because a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Steley, it is estimated that the sale of Metcaste food will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the market share of the company from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the manager of the stock manager, Hemes Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, noticed that a business meal in Melbourne "could disappear with great likelihood within a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas ' s comments.
But it is assumed that Mr. Douglass was contacted by a Board member of Metsash last week.
The share of IGA in the market has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and the income of Metcash from the food business that the company supplies to some 1,200 RITs to IGA has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 due to the operational delegation and to the pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million a year to balance retail prices with prices in Colles and Wolwarts for thousands of items each week, and assisting the IGA Reitlers in reorganizing trade sites, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider range of products.
The Director General of Metcash, Ian Morris, said that price balancing and conversion of trade areas were gaining momentum, and he hoped that the company would achieve a net profit increase in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Tannis Australia Steve Hili
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his conduct.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly injured in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more credit than critics, as President Tennessee Steve Healy says.
Kokkinakis, Jr., in a talented duet and often called "Pecal Ks", was involuntarily the focus of Cyrus' shameful conflagration with Stan Vavrinka at the Mountreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot, qualifying match at Cincinati, the judge at the tower had to double-circuit Kokkinakis and his adversary Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "The Vavrin was supposed to put on the blades of Kiryos, and I have to put this guy on the blades."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen as a tearing rocket after the ship in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible attack on US Open, Hilli loyally defends Kokkinakis.
The young man is now in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grott for the right to be second after Bernard Tomić in solitary confinement in the semi-finals of the House of Davis v. Great Britain.
"I'm very worried about one thing, which is that Tanasi was involved in the conflict," said Healy.
He actually broke the rocket when he got his foot on US Open, but he's not the first player to break the rocket when hopes are moving, and I know Tanasi's good enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at quite provocative situations in the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he's trustworthy.
He's surrounded by a great team, and he's got a beautiful family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's working a lot, he's a great teamman, he's never had trouble with other players, he's being respected outside the court, he's highly trained, he's in great shape, he's a very dedicated and developed young man, and I think he should be valued in dignity.
He also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match beginning on Friday, placing “counsel” on the right way for all, but he hoped that the fellow from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term player.
"Where do we want the team to focus fully on the match rather than on the disputes around [Kyryos]," said Healy.
And I think Nick is gaining power very quickly, as people like Federer and Marrey prove, he's growing up in public, he's made some serious mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think I need to get him out of focus for a while so that he can think about them, and that's the best thing for the team and the best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
Having declared a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detained those who were trying to enter the country illegally in order to contain the inflow of migrants.
There were riots at the border, hundreds of migrants in a border area that the Serbian authorities had retorted to.
In an uncertain time on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland broke their tents and settled in the area.
However, there was a complaint.
When a police helicopter was flying over them, migrants shouted "Open the border" and shouted insults against the Hungarian special forces.
Some rejected food and water in protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia has declared “unacceptable” the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when they are more and more coming from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution of the problem, not the accompanying damage.
Negotiations should be held with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," stated Ivica Dachić in Prague.
The fighting on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after a block of 28 countries had been unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to bear common responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (in the following month or by the end of the year) that EU member States would receive another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
The chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, and Austria, demanded that the European Union convene an emergency summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that covered the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect swift action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more authority to deal with the crisis, enabling them to close the roads and expedite asylum cases.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Minister of Hungary, Peter Cyarto, stated that his country was also planning to remove barbed wire from the border with Romania in order to close the flow of migrants through the country, now that it had completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News News correspondent Charlie Dagat reported that even prisoners had been involved in urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main “hard place” and the EU border crossing point for the settlers, many of whom are refugees who are victims of war in Syria and in the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, insists that most of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life than refugees who are victims of war, who are entitled to protection, and this view is in sharp conflict with the views of other EU countries, namely Germany.
The new laws which entered into force at midnight in Hungary now consider it a crime to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia and also include longer prison terms for the accused for trafficking in persons.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency”, stated the journalists to the Government of Zoltan Kovac in the southern city of Ceged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, Parliament should still authorize the deployment of the military forces, which is expected to take place next week, but reporters of the Associated Press, who are at the border, have been watching the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Didier Bacondi, National Security Adviser to Orbán, reported the seizure by authorized authorities of 45 persons who tried to cross the border at the border and 15 others inside the country.
They have crossed the border by breaking the fence and are currently in police custody and accused of administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities quickly rebuild the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passes on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, suppressing one of the passageways with barbed wire.
The riots broke out at the main passage of the border near the city of Ríoske, Hungary, as Hungarians placed office rooms to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds pressed one another to break through.
Some 20 people were able to enter, and thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced a denial of food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has doubled in the national survey
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to retain a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for nomination throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching it up.
Clinton is currently supported by 47 per cent of primary-democracy voters (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Bayden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, receives 15 per cent of the primary democracy vote.
More than five months before the initial election competition, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they have decided with the candidate they will support.
Clinton's supporters are more confident of their choice than of supporting other candidates.
Since CBS News last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonus.
Clinton retains a great advantage among women and the moderate, but this advantage has been reduced.
Her support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
The preponderance of Clinton by democratic voters up to 50 years of age has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now equal.
Clinton, however, still has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton went round Sanders with a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has an advantage of 5 points in this group.
Almost half of the country's primary democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if it became a party candidate.
A quarter would have supported her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would have supported her only because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm for her.
Among those who do not support Clinton at the present time, views are more controversial - only about a quarter of the enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of primary-democracy voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trumpe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), then that she is now a female president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10 per cent).
Clinton’s supporters also talk about associations linking her to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It's also called consent on issues and chances of election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary voters would like him to join the race - although one third did not think he should.
When they are asked who they would like to see second place among party candidates, the primary democratic voters are most often called Baiden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say that they would have chosen Byden's second, that's more than Sanders.
If Byden decides not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Baiden to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
This is where Bayden is far behind in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in response to the question that is most important in the candidate, democratic voters choose options other than the chances of being elected.
Like last month's situation, none of the candidates for democracies or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some of the key features of their party's primary voters.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Bayden to be honest and credible people with good leadership.
The Baiden of all three is honest, and Clinton's strong side in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary-democracy voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on it.
Primary democratic voters also generally view the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Byden as similar.
By all these measures, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Although questions about the personal e-mail box and server at Hillary Clinton continue to be questions for its Secretary-General, most of the primary voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this has not adversely affected their general view of it.
But it's a completely different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are not satisfied with her explanation, but only about one third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was shared in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the debate about e-mail has not affected their common view of Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion of it has deteriorated.
They're mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers the voters of her party to be honest and credible, this continues to be a problem for her among the registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider her to be honest and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it to be fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good leadership marks.
Of the six tested candidates, Bayden, Carson and Bush show the best outcome in integrity.
Most people see a person as honest rather than honest in Sanders than not, but, like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error limit for a sample of 351 primary voters is 6 percentage points.
As a result of the national survey, Ben Carson had come close to Donald Trumpu.
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump well in his last survey of CBS/ New York Times
Two of these candidates won half the votes of the voters in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of a stand under their feet.
Republic voters across the country continue to support Trump, whose support increased from 23 per cent in a recent CBS poll on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in a Tuesday survey.
But Carson took off from 6% to 23% of the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups, forcing Trump into a group of senior voters.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carli Fiorina and the Governor of Ohio John Kasic, have retreated back with Governor Vicensin Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor of Florida, Jab Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hakabi, and Senator of Florida, Marco Rubio, together stand third with 6%.
The number of errors for a sample of 376 Republic voters in this new survey was plus minus 6%, and the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's growth in surveys - showing 19% support among Republicans, at Trump with 32% support.
ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In view of the growing support of Carson last week, Trump made several critical cases against the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for having questioned Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the closing of the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of the first class of Baruch College
About two years after the school student died during a ceremony dedicated to a brotherhood in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge was brought against five people.
"Pe Delta Psi's brothers at Baruch New York College attacked Chan "Mayl" Deng during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and failed to bring him to hospital on time, which led to his death," were reported to the police.
Officials say that a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times while he was trying to reach his goal by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The P. Delta Psy members did not call 911 when Deng fainted, and they were expected to wait an hour before taking him to the hospital, talking to the police.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google and contact Andy Meng, National President of the Brotherhood, to ask the council, as Chief Chris Wagner told the press conference.
"At this point, members of the brotherhood began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to save him, and he died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered some blunt head injuries, fats and thighs.
“A great deal of families have suffered as a result of the rudimentary rituals, since at least one student dies every year since 1970”, said Douglas Feyerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe jury have been bent in favour of a third degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against novice and conspiracy.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but, if there is an organization that authorized all of this formally or informally, both of it”, Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood expelled the local branch office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in rates, and the bull market will collapse, the bond return will increase and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take before it comes and how long it's going to last.
Specific to the economy, history has little to say about time.
The recession came only 11 months after the first rate increase and 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, although not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
The Central Bank Administration therefore emphasizes so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates, but on how much adaptation takes place.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole matter around higher rates is exaggerated.
“The first increase in rates by the Federal Reserve, with the advent of a global financial crisis, will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of an era of ‘price money’,” said Julian Jessop, chief international economic expert in the capital economy, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy might have responded, depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the last month or so, expectations of higher rates can lead to volatility for some time.
In increasing the rate, however, the consequences are usually less dramatic.
"It's not like the proceeds of equity are slowed down 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the results of the increase in rates by the Federal Reserve.
More specifically, the market has changed dramatically over the past some 35 years - about 14 per cent in the direction of higher rates, remains fairly equal within 250 days (average growth of 2.6 per cent), then returns to normal with an average return of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief stock strategy specialist in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities is not immediately more pronounced at the rate rise, and equity revenues are beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but higher rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that did not exist before and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point during the time of the high rate.
Deutsche Bank claims that in 118 cases, only twice the nominal annual GDP since 1950 was below 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that this is for a long time, with only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such a volatile economic background can be risky and asks “will this time be different”, reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise the Federal Reserve system ' s rates throughout the year, with their views attached to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting which ends on Thursday.
While many strategy specialists and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in rates at this meeting, futures trade shows only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all rates of increase to date have been in a super-cycle of increasing financial leverage for GDP that overlaps peaks from recession, very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report states.
In contrast, this was a very slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve system has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record is 35 months, all 74 months and not yet over.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market is waiting for higher rates, and this scenario is in some ways similar to what is being done for equity.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will be faster than for shares when the Federal System changes the strategic direction.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the return changes the vector immediately after the first increase/decrement in the cycle.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, the bond return immediately falls," reports Deutsche.
The strategy experts from Charles Schwab believe that an increase in interest rates will bring long-term and short-term bonds closer together to make the curve more flat.
High-income bonds often behave better in this climate, although "we're still afraid of income fluctuations," says a study by Cathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal System policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are signs that the market has been tailored to the prospect of a tighter monetary policy”, she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans rose, the yield curve was flatter, credit lines increased, the volatility increased - all market characteristics were increased when federal policies were tightened.
Generally speaking, companies with their main business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International debt companies will find themselves in a worse position because a growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt more expensive in the financial space.
"The history shows that `quality' shares demonstrate efficiency above market within three months of initial rate increases," said Goldman Sachs analysts in the customer report.
Stable financial companies have lost an average of 5 percentage points per increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
High-income companies, as well as low-voltility shares, have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares by an average of 4 (percentage) and 3 (percentage) respectively.
The duty becomes a big question.
High-interest floating-rate companies will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange transactions, consumers would benefit from a growing dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts differ as to how fast this will take place.
"BBC Radio 3 - copy of Classic FM," approves Andrew Bingham, Member of Parliament, of the Conservatives.
Member of Parliament from Conservatives Andrew Bingham criticized the “slowing standards” station
Proves that it's getting less and less different than a commercial competitor.
Also aimed at BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize is just a prize served with the British
Damien Collins Parliamentary College, which hit The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM," said a parliamentary leader, urging the television company to prove that it was doing something that commercial companies were not doing.
A member of Parliament from Conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC leadership that the public radio station seemed to be “smoothing” and increasingly different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems like I don't like using the word "pardon" - but it seems to be turning into a Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Award launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else, these are two examples that first came to my mind, where you're really just copying what's already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The Director General of BBC rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival when it came to living music and the education of the audience.
What I find out about Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live speech and music is not really compared to anyone else.
"So very important, I think the interest of Radio 3 in finding new music and moving new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past because British people were less educated in classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only child of BBC who was attacked by commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Member of Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because of a lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Fait and Boy George participate as judges, was made in the BBC typical style.
He added what he wants from the Corporation to find a hit in his home stable next time she starts a fun project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of new seasons The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the licence fee for other entertainment formats.
The increase in Internet sales slowed down as much as possible in August, and it could be Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase of 7 per cent in online sales
Last month, there has been the slowest increase since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could help contain expenditure
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been experiencing booms, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs of equalization of online sales after the latest data showed only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August had shown a minimal increase since it began to be recorded in 2000, only five per cent higher.
Experts say that there are now signs of equalization of online sales after the latest data showed only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they've always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkhee, editor of the IIRG sales index.
He explained that the online sales had intensified three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's coming up on the plateau, and you can see the decrease.
Black Friday's phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowing down of sales.
The experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying the event on the eve of the last Friday November.
Last year, buyers of five times the average time they had reached computers to make good use of offers, thereby disrupting a number of sellers ' websites.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, when buyers go into a real fight for profitable purchases, could force people to refrain from stepping.
According to a study published by the British Retal Consortium, just over £1 out of every 5 is spent online.
With respect to products such as television and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through Internet cars.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online than in fashion shops in central streets.
Muslims are kept dead in the fall of the tap in Makkah, and Ben Laden's family is subject to sanctions
Moslems carry the bodies of 29 dead people through the streets, as the first funerals are beginning in Mecca.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia blamed in part for the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also injured following the collapse of the tap
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who had died as a result of the collapse of the tap on the main Makki mosque.
Dressed mainly in white, those present at the funeral filled the carriageway in order to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A sad procession passed by a sacred place where only a few days earlier, a building tap had struck the ceiling of the mosque and fallen upon the visitors.
The bodies were issued for burial, and at the same time the king of Saudi Arabia fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 visitors who died in a tap crash at the General Mosque were carried across the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Kasim Akram, of Bolton, the Grand Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage trip when the tap was broken.
Mr. Akram was in the General Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the haj will continue to be in Makkah, as thousands of people continue to enter the city.
King Salman said today that Binladin Group should not have left the arrow of a tap raised in a non-working tap.
The Arab version of the decree published by the State Agency Saudi Press states that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the offence.
The English version of the news agency did not describe this detail, but reported that company leaders were prohibited from travelling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the tap’s fall into the House of the General Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were sent to the hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements on the collapse of the tap, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inadequate coordination with the Meteorological Service.
Dozens of taps surround the Main Holy of Mecca, as part of the extensive construction work being carried out by the Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been one of Saudi Arabia ' s immediate ruling families for decades and has managed the largest construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a changeable son who rejected the family in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about £174,000) to the relatives of the deceased, and the same amount is irreversible.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q states that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European workers working for a small amount of money.
According to Verónica Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair experts
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
Output - opening of more than 200 new Screphix shops for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q warehouses across the country
Author: Rupert Staner, chief urban correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to be laying the hammers and the painters aside, and instead to hire qualified East Europeans to do the work in the house.
If you can handle a hammer or a trap to paint walls, it seems as if you are a minority today.
Because, according to the owner company B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring skilled artisans to perform simple housework.
Véronique Lori, the new Director General of Kingfisher, who owns a network of home maintenance services, reported that this trend is followed by a significant influx of skilled East European workers offering services at a minimum cost.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screphix shops specializing in workshop products and at the same time close 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in B&Q stores since eight out of ten shop shopping decisions were made by weak women.
At present, most staff are men.
The recent demographic trends, she said, were not to be overlooked, as there were increasing numbers of households made up of single women who were more involved in the housing of their homes than in the past.
Ms. Laurie said, "Our shops are still mostly men.
Steps must be taken to achieve a balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on goods acquired are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women in charge of leading British companies whose shares are recorded in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team by reaching the Directors of Equal Number of Men and Women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company where 50 per cent of managers are women, including the general and financial director.
Ms. Laurie said, "It was a conscious solution, diversification is an important question for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was easy.
After the group incurred the costs of closing the shops, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profits and sales for six months.
As a result of this Kingsfisher trend, which owns Scewix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new shops
Decision-making times at the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world has observed a meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank, which discusses, within two days, the most important decision to raise or not the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believe that it would still be time-consuming and maintain the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, since seven years have passed since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero point of view and start normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, director of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy works efficiently, economic recovery adds trillion dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the solution will affect the world economy.
He warned markets that they should be prepared for change, but everyone says that they are confident that all chances are against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 8.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees going to the EU through Croatia.
Open it up! Hundreds of refugees are being scandalized at the Horgosh crossing on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
From Tuesday, Budapest closed the border for the settlers.
Asylum-seekers are already beginning to see other routes to the European Union.
One of them is located through Romania on a closed border with Serbia.
The other one is through Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that carried refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now on their way to Shida town on the Croatian border.
Drivers were instructed by the authorities to follow without stops.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Neboša Stephanović, assures that his country is doing everything it can to help refugees, but its capacity is limited:
Our work is to protect Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people and ensure that they are treated humanely.
But it's already a pan-European problem.
It is difficult to resolve, and no country in Europe can do it alone, and much less a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Víctor Orban is unswerving:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia it must fill in the necessary documents for that purpose.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country either, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already built a 175-tilometre fence on the border with Serbia.
Orban does not intend to stop there, but he plans to build the same barrier on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Maimarakis' gospel, "Europeans want to help us."
The Gospel of Maymarakis had been a member of the legal powers for a number of years and had led the country to a financial crisis, according to the left.
Now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, he challenges Cypress.
A few days before the election, he met a journalist, Euronius.
Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronius!
I thank you for your invitation.
Euronius: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by giving up the SIRIS coalition, but now, according to the polls, "New Democracy" was on the same level as it was popular.
What has changed in this time?
The Gospel of Maymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Cypris lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago Greece had surpluses in its budget and prospects for economic growth.
The country now has a fiscal deficit and a high level of unemployment.
Investors left because Mr. Cypris drove them away.
During the past nine months, the Greeks had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cypras.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what actually happened.
Daily life was markedly worse than in January, when the situation improved, and this concerned most Greek citizens.
But you're saying that if you win the election, you'll seek alliances with other parties, including SIRIZ.
The fact is, as we have seen in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, political forces and all ruling parties have met together to implement the programme they have agreed on without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronius: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Cypras and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new primer on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
The Gospel of Maymarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece's movement along the European road because we have a good idea of the disastrous consequences of its withdrawal from the EU.
Europe now helps us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Uncker package and banking assistance.
All of this would have been lost if there had been no treaty with Europe.
But the current cost-saving measures were the result of Mr. Cypras' negotiation.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government in the first year wants to bring order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of the resultant recession can be negotiated again, but only after some time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to resume negotiations with our creditors, as they look forward to the full implementation of the agreement.
If we are to regain their trust, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to take advantage of EU financing and the great investment opportunities that we must provide for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Qypras has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have found out by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers' incomes.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Qypras had never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and poorly informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronius: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Junker, Olland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, said to them?
evangelis Maymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that before the end of 2014, we tried to best implement the 2012 agreement by crossing its sharp corners.
We have moved forward with reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted under emergency circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek government.
At the time, I was the Speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which then formed the Government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, which was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations from outside.
And we were able to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process were not interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
EuroNews: A massive flow of refugees has been moving through Greece for the past weeks.
What do you think of this situation and the response of European countries to which these people aspire?
evangelis Maymarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after winning the election.
The reason is that the SIRIZ Government did not act in this situation as it should.
Such matters should be acted on in advance, because only emergency measures remain if the problem confronts you.
And we're in this situation now.
Even the interim government that replaced SIRIZ did more in just seven days than Mr. Cypras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions by the interim Government, which has received valuable assistance from the President of the Republic, who has called for the EU summit, will lead to a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice, refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are victims of the Syrian war, victims of some extraordinary events that have taken place with them.
There is a deep humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will adhere to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
A decision should be taken at the EU summit and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance received from the EU in order to cope with this pressing problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for your interviews.
Maryarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Sorkowka Donetsk, the criminal investigation officers of the District General Police together with the military counter-conspiracy identified and detained a suspect who turned up a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Crevo Rog (Dnepropetrov region), who had been on the eve of the night during the joint consumption of alcoholic beverages, and the conflict in the village of Yasinawatsk, Donetchina district, had shot his opponent at an assault rifle.
A 22-year-old reported a wound from a hospital where he was hospitalized with through-the-foot wounds.
According to Artem Vasitzki, Deputy Chief of Criminal Investigation of the Police Head of the Region, law enforcement officers have proven that the figure was involved in another serious criminal offence: the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operators found that on the same day there had been a conflict between the suspect and another local resident, which had resulted in a fatal wound to the head of the man.
Criminal proceedings under the articles “Investigative murder” and “Intensively causing serious bodily harm” of the Criminal Code have been opened by the Investigation Division of the Friendly TCU.
The detainee is threatened with deprivation of liberty for up to 15 years.
Figurant was detained and detained in a temporary detention facility and reported to the Dontska district police service.
Two inhabitants of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in the colour of the Ukrainian flag, including two of Vladimir Lenin's monuments, were sentenced by the Russian court to imprisonment.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to a restriction of their liberty.
Novosibirsk prisoners were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years ' imprisonment.
Two other convicted persons were subjected to 14 and 18 months ' imprisonment.
The Lenin Court of Novosibirsk found the four citizens guilty of vandalism in respect of Lenin monuments, which were located in the vicinity of the CRC and on the street of Trikotze, as well as in the Memorial of the "Slurment of Glory".
In the latter case, Katyusha and T-34 were painted.
Remember, on the night of December 12, in Russian Novosibirsk, unknown men painted military equipment in the colour of the Ukrainian flag on the Mount of Glory.
The civilian wife of a popular Russian actor named Eugenia Tsiganova Irina Leonov gave birth to a seventh child.
The girl appeared in a Moscow clinic.
The newborn and her mother feel good.
Remember, recently, Tsyganov and Leonov broke up.
Eugen refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions for everything.
Evgenia Cyganov is 36 years old.
He's an actor at the Moscow theatre "Master Peter Fomenko."
It's known for "The Walk," "The Cosmos as a Predation," "The Cross Strongness," "Otteppel" and "Farza".
On 8 September, Eugenius Tsyganov was recognized as "Acterom of the Year" and "The Year Man" on the version of the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
A man who opened fire at Delta State University left an apology note
After the shooting and murder of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning, and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he would “sgrudge” the first murder and wish to “all return” to the authorized authorities on Tuesday.
The City of Gothie, Mississippi, reports that a professor of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta called 911 hours in the morning.
On Monday and told me he shot somebody.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police should send people to his home.
He said, "Yesterday, I killed my wife," and he said, "There's no one in the house," but probably upset.
The police asked for the phone name, but he didn't name it.
Lamb did not explain why he opened the shooting.
When the police arrived at the scene of the crime, they found Amy Prentis' body there, age 41, and a hand-written note from Lamba, age 45, saying, "I'm sorry, I'd like to bring it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb traveled 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Smidt, a history teacher, and on the evening of Monday, when the police surrounded him, he killed himself.
University Rector William Laforge reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb had a novel between Prentis and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday reported “no information or evidence” of a “love triangle”.
The prentis was described as a "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who said he was married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told me he and Prantis had a daughter of 19, and she's "silent."
He added that Prince and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay News, which San Herald calls a close friend of Prentisss, the last one worked from home on the Internet.
Noles told me that Prentis had a hunting dog called Lighting, and that she had met Lamb for about three years.
Noles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family at some point on Monday to say, "He won't go to prison."
On the same day that the police caught him on the 1-road road near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods, and shot himself.
According to a summary posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a Ph.D. degree in pedagogy at the University of Delta.
Stars lost their fortune
Acter (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), experienced several difficult years.
In 2001, he was fighting leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his multi-year companion, Farru Fosette, who died of cancer.
The actor was reported to have also suffered from drug addiction and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
This has certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw has been out of Manchester United for several months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the match of the League of Champions, where Manchester United lost PSV in Windhoven.
While the defence counsel is experiencing this, which will prevent him from entering the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again during this season.
The injury occurred during the reckless attack of Hector Moreno at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV fine zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double fracture and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or day later and then operated.
It's terrible. A young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, got over a lot of trouble and played fantastically, and it happened here.
It had an oxygen mask on it.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy won't be able to play in a group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Morno was lucky he didn't get a red card and no Toolbar was assigned.
Nicholas Rizzoli's arbitrator didn't punish a Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge yourself when I say it's worth a bar and a red card.
It was a very bad ride from two legs.
In his Twitter, Shaw says, "Thank you for all your messages, not to describe how I'm devastated, my path to recovery starts, I'll come back stronger than I was."
On the theme: Manchester United is going through a disaster with Luke Shaw when he hits a PSV game.
The British defender will have an additional incentive to recover to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coca, coach PSV, said, "This is a very serious trauma."
When any player gets hurt like this, everyone's really upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to hurt the enemy.
Moreno was broken when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gall on the Mira Championship in 2014.
"It's very hard for him now, because he didn't have the intention to hurt the enemy, and when you hear it's a very serious trauma, you feel bad," Coca said.
I couldn't see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball that flew in a different direction, so it looked like he (Morno) touched it, but I didn't see a pillow underneath Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6 Morno, he said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry it.
I'm very hard, and I'm sorry.
Andres Guardado, from PSV, was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it will take some time before you know it almost alone.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question from a representative of a vacation company about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister selected Lorax, an environmental story written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment published on the SuperCamps website, and he says, "This is a fun, moving, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children because it always reveals some kind of image or message that we're missing."
Everything would be good, except the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to translate the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the one-name film that was filmed in 2012, with new characters and details added to create a variety of original narratives.
"In the high walls of the city of Usmnuville, where there was no green and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart -- the girl of his dreams, fulfilling her desire -- to see the real tree," we read in a love story text that Dr. Suzou (now the name of Theodore Sews Ghazel) died in 1991.
If it doesn't seem suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of the film's "Lorax" on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high walls of the city of Usmnulville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart -- the girl of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, who is generally recognized as an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about the destruction of the environment by a greedy tree cut-off and by a "all" findkins, despite Lorax's protests (who's named after the book), is a ridiculous creature with a mustache that "speaks on behalf of trees".
Most likely, such a simple PR task was entrusted to an executive who had never read a book about Lorax 20 consecutive times.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron headquarters, but no further comments had been received.
For Adam Lithuania, there was obviously a risk of not getting into collecting England, but it's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the repetition of the 3-0 test series that happened last time does not seem likely.
I would also not rule out winning my field.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it includes some of the reflectors who are sexually picky and who have been thinking hard; they will not bring scars since 2012, but only young men's positives.
With Moen Ali's ball, it becomes a ball-thrower, and Adil Rashid, even if he's unknown to the test level, is an attacker.
On the topic: Adam Little left prefabricated England for a test cricket and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to exclude Adam Lithuania to me, his chief coach at Yorkshire, is, of course, difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult circumstances, and a clear but harsh reality that the players in the cricket were assessed as judges on the basis of the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to the announcement, because (and I said that earlier) the players chose best themselves.
A couple of half a hundred, and Lithuania might have been waiting for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own destiny.
We hope that if he takes more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another possibility.
The chief English coach, Trevor Biliss, spoke well of his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; first of all, he's a team player and then everything else.
The question is, how long will it take before the betaman of the test cricket leaves an impression on himself, a difficult question.
Let's play seven games like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you might welcome is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Prime League when Lithuania was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's a beta man I appreciate highly.
He's an unpredictable cricket that we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was something.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but it will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The thought of putting Moan next to Cook as a opening baton, which would allow for the introduction of an additional spinner by retaining four high-speed bowlers, is thought out, and I'm not against that.
I can't see why the beating player can't hit the ball there, and that lion has already shown that he's a damn good cricket.
Moan may not be exactly what is needed for his county Woostershire, but he has become the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old comrade on Justin Langer's team played his first 38 test matches with a "third betaman" before starting in 2001.
He won three hundred won right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the prefabricated stand-up, and at my brief conversation with him, he appears to me to be a very promising young man.
People can look at his example statistics -- on average, 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky rate, but there's a little of the spinners who chose youth.
He's going to learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the prefabricated, England plans to make a few practical additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauwarddin, a Sri Lankan betaman, as a consultant for a test match, could be a master move.
He's one of the best guys for the game, and he's going to bring her the best experience she's ever had in any kind of attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where the white ball is used and will provide both energy and an unspoiled pace in the Setep.
I've always felt that he was born to be involved in an international scream, whether it's a game or a coaching job, and like Mahella, has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what they said before, can give new strength to the team.
The College of College of Darham Ben Stokes is left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break in relation to Australia, and I do not, for example, have any problems with this.
While not all agree, the coaches and those who select the players do not set a timetable.
And you have to remember, like the players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to take.
A British camp of supporters from the European Union can win if the economy is depressed by 2017.
David Cameron's thoughtless policy to resume negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly difficult every day, even without looking back at the election of genius Jeremy, "Is it true or not?" -- Corbin is the leader of the Labour Council or TUC's opposition to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbinas and Nigela Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained on the day that under the current situation of the EU, which is experiencing a variety of crises — not all of their own manufactures — some of the participating countries are on the throat of the British self-centric agendas of seeding concessions and undermining agreements of change that they generally do not want.
When he met in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he did not want them in any case if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "Davi and George's Selfi Program."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance travel through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against or without a prominent local monument, local celebrities companies, and then come home and say they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
"Don't leave us with France," says Berlin, a European friend who wants to be interested in maintaining external contacts with Britain under the shadow of the European Union, says, "Don't leave us with France," suggests that the frozen ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they don't care, stay or leave.
Angel Merkel, a very cautious chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years, and wants to leave the office before the situation deteriorates for her, as she deteriorated for those in her seat, Thecher (11 years), Mitterrand (14 years), and Kolya (16).
The French Head of France, François Alland, stands before re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland can soon obtain a nationalist government of the right, Spain of the left.
It's hard to see them coming out of the skin to help selfi Brits whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving Great Britain, which they also don't want, because most people have similar separatist trends.
So some such ministers may even plan for the issuance of deliberately useless SNP-style belts during the 2017 British referendum campaign in order to speed up Britain's withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
“The review was an idea-fix” and “Britania did not receive anything valuable from the renewed negotiations”.
Europeans know of their troubles as a predator of Fleet Street and as skeptical of the EU, unlike Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, which supported our entry into 1973 by the ratio of 2:1.
They may be embarrassed to remember Boris Johnson, a well-established Euro-portunist known for his “direct EU bananas” of Brussels columnist in the early 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a short-term company of fearful taxes for buggers, telephone hackers and non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact Tony Blair had the same opinion about them, but he was aware that when you're in a cell with a large gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and keep her from eating you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Milliband was more a member of Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's idea of referendum, since Blair was in favor of the repealed EU Constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of this.
But sweet Jeremy Corbin, who friendly shook me on the back of Westminster on Monday -- I told him he no longer had time to spend it on me -- seems to be at risk of repeating Neal Kinnock's "Murdocot" strategy of the '80s -- mistake then and now.
It could take time, but he had to develop a coherent strategy for working with the press -- not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose couch he was sitting on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditional Ukip trend and a wider range of "small England's "partners" can probably say yes.
That's the same thing as Hilary-"Benn, but not Bennit"-Benn said on radio and TV this week, and his internal boycott refused to admit that Corbin's appointment of the unnamed John McDonnell as the "thorn" Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought hard on TV for his lack of loyalty to his colleagues in the Labour Cabinet without going too far or losing his post in the Cabinet.
Hilary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain “under any circumstances” is Benn's statement -- not what McDonnell said, nor what J.C. spoke to the pens and members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, according to general opinion.
To tell democracy and Corbin's "his boyfriend" -- remember, he touched even me -- the discipline of messages remains important in a 24-hour television age seven days a week, especially in a social networking diver, paranoia and betrayal.
It's reasonable not to let Cameron walk away from Europe as easily as possible, allowing him to accept as the proper support of the Leborers during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbin are no longer a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissisism, born of minor differences, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his errors regarding Nato - Tom Watson is unswerving that J.K. will not campaign for withdrawal - foreign diplomats will have to try to reach their leaders at home.
Why do Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on British concessions when this can be meaningless?
The United States of America is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of Britishs in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of the Tory is cutting back on costs, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at a forum called British Investment Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
The Government-funded agency stated that 95 per cent less harmful electronic cigarettes than smoking had been reported at a meeting of 12 persons, some of whom were related to tobacco, according to researchers.
Experts published in British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) agency in their electronic cigarette report.
PHE published an important report - last month's "turnal milestone" - called it "the comprehensive review of evidence."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the link between some experts and the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month, a “extremely sensitive argument” was criticized on the basis of which PCHE had built its main opinion.
In article BMJ, two additional researchers asked whether these statements had “solid or reasonable grounds”.
Martin McCay, professor of European Health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: “The fundamental principle of health - rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness”.
They said that the public expects that PHE's statements that “the best assessment shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco” were based on detailed evidence analysis and modelling.
In fact, this is from the only meeting of 12 people to develop a model for multi-criteria analysis of decision-making in order to consolidate their views on the harm associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McCy and Capewell reported that one of the convention sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose Director General was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT health certificates in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting announced funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, not referring to the funding he had reportedly received from Philip Morris, a tobacco company.
There was no reasonable explanation for the selection of Board members, but there were several well-known e-smokers, some of whom also announced industry funding for publication.
It is not known if other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The head of the tobacco service to PHE also visited the meeting.
A scientific article published by the group “consistently” with the fact that there is insufficient “evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most of the criteria”, wrote McCy and Capewell.
However, none of these linkages and restrictions were addressed in the PHE report.
McCy and Capewell reported that PHE statements that “no evidence at the moment that electronic cigarettes are a road leading to children or non-smokers” were premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of the health and well-being service at PHE, reported that BMJ statements had previously been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two smokers died of his passion.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what proves and does not prove this evidence, especially where the public has doubts about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs NHS $2 billion a year.
Clearly, though not safe, electronic cigarettes cause only part of the harm caused by smoking, we do our tasks before the nation.
Former Head of Channel 4 believes that BBC should stop the Eastenders series
Former Head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop issuing programs such as Eastenders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give much to such successful shows as Alberta's soap opera.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should be used only to create programmes that are not produced by other British television companies.
He criticized BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are definitely only a small part of the audience, on peak television, when competitors have high rating shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the Director General of BBC, Tony Hall, said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he had tried to cooperate successfully with BBC for six years while working on Channel 4.
“I cannot escape the idea that BBC prepares for launch and broadcasts transfers that could be shown by competing companies that do not receive grants”, Johnson told the members of the House of Lords Communications Communications Committee as part of an investigation of the future fate of BBC.
If you maintain a licence fee, which I do not consider to be a good solution in the medium and long term, then companies should only remain on the air for those programmes that are not produced or are not about to be produced by other companies.
The Voice shows up in prime salon because the creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea of nobody showing him again is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to funding gears that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, Eastenders is another; it is generally known that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly give much for it.
I don't understand how this can be a public broadcast.
I don't think that would have been humiliating to BBC.
A serial businessman named Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of pursuing ratings “because of staff ambitions and their belief that this is the best way to obtain long-term support”.
His comments on the most popular BBC shows are echoed by the Executive Director of Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his McTaggart Memorial lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, offered BBC to sell Eastenders series.
Johnson noticed that the more senior BBC programs of a public nature “continued to go to BBC4 where it is often impossible to assess an audience, but the company's function has been performed, and this can be argued in the Ghanaian sermons justifying revenue from a 4 billion pounds license fee: “Yes, of course, we are doing all these confusing transfers that no one's watching.”
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
With regard to the license fee, Johnson informed the Committee: “I encourage you to find a more regression system as to who will get the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people who have 150 pounds a large money, I'm curious, because they don't think so, because they don't look very closely and listen to BBC.
The former executive director of the Sky and Channel 5, David Elsten, who also addressed the committee last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission “inform, educate and entertain”.
He noted that only a small proportion of the materials produced by BBC were now formally classified as educational - he said it was 1% of the television content and 0.1% of the radio - and that the company had to take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the theme “information, education and entertainment”.
On partnership issues, Elstein noted that BBC should make greater efforts in areas such as “Promendial concerts” (only part of them reported as TV), as well as join alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available online.
Sonogenesic allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how negotiators change direction as they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have removed worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound waves.
The tiny dragnets change direction at a time when they are influenced by sound impulses too high to be heard by the human ear.
Pulse effects through the activation of neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
On the other hand, researchers control brain activity by light
Scientists have told us that worms demonstrate the potential of a new technique called “sonogenetics”, the essence of which is the use of ultrasonics to attract certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, and the source of the ultrasonics is located outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a scientist at the Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this technique could once replace the deep stimulation of the brain, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the brain and used to treat Parkinson's disease.
The nematode worms don't usually react to ultrasonics, but Chalasani found that they started reacting when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the body of worms.
Intensified ultrasonic waves affect structures called "RTP-4" found in some worm cells in membranes.
The ultrasonic waves make these ion channels open and initiate cells associated with them, reported in the Nature Communications report.
To create a nematode that can be controlled by ultrasonics, Chalasani made genetic modifications to worms, so their motor neurons used the ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasonics to influence modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and entered into the organisms by activated modified motor neurons.
This methodology is similar to that used in the “optogenic” -- a new direction that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off by means of light pulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this methodology, Sonogenesics may have some advantages.
Unlike light delivered to the right part of the brain on fibers, low - frequency ultrasonic waves easily pass through the body’s tissues, so they do not have to pass through the skull box.
" We believe that the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses to treat certain neurologic diseases in clinical conditions will make human neurons sensitive to an ultrasonic signal for a while," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin producing cells.

Advertising the British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International's video protesting an arms exhibition.
It's amazing killer drones!
Destructive iron candalas!
Cluster bombs!
Electrical light and noise oaks that cause untold pain, but do not leave any trace!
There is no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition, a fruit parody prepared by Amnesty International, is intended to draw attention to the British Government's intention to push weapons into repressive regimes, using the exhibition of defence technologies and security systems in the ExCeL centre in Doclends.
On the theme: DSEI Arms Exhibition: authoritarian regimes go to London
But a special campaign also leads to the sudden arrival of numerous bus stop posts and subway trains, which require a look at them again.
"A major DLR announcement from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them in London Underground fonts depicting the DLR line, which turns into a tank silhouette.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will attack the DLR line.
300 postors are painted by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Hard Design in Banky's "Dismaland".
A group called the “Special patrol” team helped spread them throughout London by using “a 6-pound billboard kit”, which “is said to provide access to about one third of the global public space at bus stops”.
London transporters are not happy about such “vandalism” in the form of unauthorized postage.
One of the parody announcements issued by the individual patrol team.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the Cruel Designers exhibition and teacher at the University of Essex, artists become more demanding and seek to deliver political art to audiences outside the galleys.
Many artists are starting to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms exhibition welcoming passengers in the subway.
The image from Amnesty has been viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and has been created by a pro bono VCCP with a graphic designer and sound artist who also works free of charge.
The VCCP CEO Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around an arms exhibition, with a pass on the Excel calendar, and thought, "Let's give them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They thought of creating a more realistic and sophisticated corporate advertising, but “to fill her houses with bright colors and animation has proved to be a more exciting experience”.
"They helped us to draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," said Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take action to guarantee that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of an arms exhibition comes from inside ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order for "AT4CS RS for shoulder fire" from the U.S. Army.
It includes “unlike cumulative warheads which produce an irreconcilable armament within the purpose”.
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules of Residence
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student home as a normal 19-year-old man who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now that I remember the heavy smiles of those I've been exasperating -- and the many, long complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
The move in the dorm may range from a slight nerve to a totally frightening one.
He encourages chattering: telling people where you came from, whether you took academic leave and where you spent it, whether you support Corbina and why you're "honorably, neither love nor hate Marmite," because, seriously, guys, it's just a man-in-law extract of HAHAHAH, I'll be at my own house."
Take a breath.
And help others rest, too, by asking questions and showing interest.
This promotes conversation and helps you to find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if you had a firefight, and they would give you fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking facilities, parapets, and common party sites, but they're also the place where people dress and fix underwear.
On the topic: Don't even think about starting university studies when you're in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room should be a haven, but many dormitories form a culture of dress from one room to another, thus promoting friendship, communication and long-term friendship.
It could be a hell of a person who's trying to restore power.
Nothing in culture lets you say, "I like you, and I want to keep my friendship with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy I spent on you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of communicating, not knocking on him, but sending an SMS.
By the way, on the knock: do it.
One guy in my dorm followed this principle: If the door wasn't locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends with a drink.
As you start university life on the peak of the Bake-Off show, knock on the door to people to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies is not that strange, it's not like the 1950s with their "We're neighbors, I've done something for you, and now smile, and I'm going to ask you personal questions."
Offering home meals is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually your face will be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are.
The bad, blindened tufts of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to make people pretend to sleep when you knock on them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, placing someone's chickens is stealing, but is it stealing to take a little milk for tea?
Get along with the owner of the milk.
He's likely to invite you not to be shy, even if you're angry inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I feel sorry for you -- but try to treat this adult more than my roommate, who poured water into her milk to wash dishes to avenge those who took it without demand.
She's in prison now.
You don't have to make noise that's going to stop people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're the same people from the glass house talk.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to remove the sound of a drum and bass guitar because there was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased his volume.
When he finally fell silent at 5: 00 a.m., she graciously let him sleep for two hours and then dropped her music and locked the door behind her for a three - hour test.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse settled in the same dormitories as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be unusual to bite elbows, never mind if you were to take a neighbor as your future spouse, get involved in them, break up their relationship, and have to see him every day, and perhaps watch him drag all your friends to his side?
Of course, do not order your heart — but if a hot neighbor is not exactly your prospective mate, try to cool your own dust a little.
At that exciting moment, when you realize that someone has left the keys inside his own locked room, the line between play and grass is thinner than it seems.
Good play is fun, but it turns into the opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach me a valuable and interesting lesson on safety by hiding something, but don't ever hear somebody's toothpaste room and shampoo.
With somebody else's door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you'll put in the freezer -- but don't stick other things with Blue-Tack to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on iPhone after an update from Apple
The new operating system can be requested by entering Settings, selecting General, and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download it and install it.
Some encountered problems after installation when an error message appeared telling them that “The application could not be updated”.
To avoid this, users are encouraged to wait until the resuscitation is dead or try to update through iTunes.
The phone hints will allow you to go through the entire process.
The process may include the removal of free space applications - but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also facilitated implementation by means of a special utility that proposes the removal of the applications and re-installing them once the process has been completed.
It is worth making sure your phone is charged or next to your charger when you are updated to prevent battery discharges.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop updating because the phone discharge can lead to a failure in the process.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow has provided to President Assad has only increased the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, writing PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry called the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss Russian military activity in Syria.
This is what PJ Media reports.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that the continued support of President Assad on the part of Russia poses a risk of exacerbation and extension of the conflict, as well as a negative impact on our common objective of combating extremism, unless we also continue to focus on finding solutions to the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power”, stated representatives of the United States State Department.
They also noted that Kerry had reiterated the United States' commitment to the fight against “Islamic State” through a coalition from more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the U.S. “will be pleased to see Russia's constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State”.
Last Friday, representatives of the White House stated that they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was about to discuss the matter with Moscow.
On the other hand, the White House Spokesperson, Josh Ernest, noted that the time for telephone conversations between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, had not yet come: “When the President decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin would benefit us, then he will pick up the phone and try to make this call.”
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase its support for the Assad regime's “loss rate”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake that the continued support of Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he didn't listen to my warnings -- and as a result, the situation worsened," said the U.S. President.
The imported yachts will be exempt from the payment of customs duties.
Mini-economic development intends to temporarily free imported yachts and other floating means of rest and sport from customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of concessional goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on instructions from the Government of the Russian Federation.
The Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Laškin, reported on this.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, as a result of his visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of agencies, namely, Minoconom development, MFM, MCS, FSB, FTS, Russia, to prepare proposals to create an enabling environment for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, the experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
The owners prefer to keep their ships abroad, and some 200 million a year go to the treasury of European States for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission “On the amendment of the list of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes” providing for full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means of rest and sport.
In the view of the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, noted Lashkin.
This issue was brought before the Subcommission on Customs, Non-tariff Regulation, Protection Measures in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and the discussion was also endorsed by agencies.
As the representative of the Ministry of Development had pointed out, the proposed measure for full conditional release from import was essentially a relief.
Therefore, after the adoption of the protocol, the meeting of the Subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EAEC member States, Lashkin.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to facilitate foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for science, culture, film, sports and tourism applications, for international assistance and so on. These include office equipment (personal computers, writing machines), test equipment, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and religious objects.
In Mintupa's press service, the Russian Federation “Izvedivida” reported that it had issued binding orders on the seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatoria, which provided for simplified arrangements for the passage and exit of small-scale, sporting sailing and recreational vessels to the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has requested the captains of the Crimea seaports to ensure that the simplified procedure for small-scale, sporting sailing and pleasure craft is applied to the seaport and that the listed vessels leave the seaport.
The Ministry has also prepared draft regulations of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the limits of the Crimea seaports.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, orders had already been issued, and the rest were in the process of being agreed upon, as noted in the press service of the department.
The Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol are of the view that the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol should be responsible for the registration of small-scale vessels used for non-profit purposes.
The problem is that in Russia, it is precisely because of poor infrastructure that makes the yachting extremely difficult.
If you look at southern Italy and France, it's a growing industry where a lot of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything is standing still.
Our coast is not interested, the only piece where yachts can be exploited around the world; it is the Black Sea in Sochi, Helendjik, Novorossiska, Anapa.
But the difficulty is that the rules of the border guards are very strict in this area: to get out of the yacht, you have to get a lot of permits.
Besides, inside Russia, yacht doesn't even have any gas.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there's a problem where she can take it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As for yacht storage sites, in Moscow and St. Petersburg there are now special yachts up to 30 m. The yachts are also deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are wealthy people, but with the outbreak of the crisis, the demand for yachts declined.
The World Bank has granted US$ 500 million to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“New funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, the communication states.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Zayao Fan, stated that the reform of the banking sector would help restore credit in the real economy and stimulate economic recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that there were first signs of stabilization in the World Bank.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
The Polish Government has previously approved a loan in Ukraine 100 million, passing on RIA News.
Prisons are requested to set up separate units for trans-genders.
At the Public Council of the Federal Prison Service (FREN) for the Defence of the Rights of Prisoners in October 2015, among other matters will discuss the possibility of establishing separate units in colonies for trans-genders and transvestites.
This is what Vladislav Grib, a council member of the Council, told the Izvetoms.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-sex prisoners in Russia, separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such offenders) may be envisaged in domestic prisons, in the long run, to establish a special colony for transgenders.
Vladislav Grib stresses, however, that it is only possible to determine whether citizens are serving their sentences in such isolated places after the convicted have passed appropriate medical examinations that prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgeners from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
He said that the proposed practice was operating well abroad: in SIZO (where the accused were before the court) there were separate chambers for trans-genders and in correctional institutions special units.
Today, it's the only way to deal with such criminals.
There is a clear need to isolate them, since the presence of transvestites and transgeners in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, it is the suffering of their families and the sea of problems for FSIN employees.
The humiliation of trances by cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large a city, how many criminals with unknown genders, needs to be counted on to distribute them.
Some are definitely not needed by SIZO - just cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgeners.
According to Grib, 50 or 100 persons may be held in the unit, and if a specialized unit is set up in Russia alone, the prisoners will be able to serve their sentences from any region.
Citizens are held in SIZO at the place where the crime was committed, so the receipt of transvestites or transgenders from other actors during the investigation and trial is not realistic, but the introduction of such practices for convicted persons in a particular colony - yes - is considered by Grib.
Remember, the day before, law enforcement officials were unable to decide which detention centre, male or female, to identify a drug-absorbed 24-year-old, Domitri Koukanov (known as Alin Davis), which prevented a male and female person from being arrested.
He was released home under a non-departure signature.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and in the media, since the mechanism for the maintenance of trans-genders in SIZO and colonies in Russia is not yet available.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolay Alexev supported the idea of creating special places to serve the sentence by transgeners, noting that it is also possible to define people in colonies - male or female - depending on their own will.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, just as there's security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alexeiev.
Prisons must be safe, so separate blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, especially since they are more in prison than transgeners.
At the same time, Alexeiev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to pretend to be transexuals in order to get into what is different from the ordinary colony.
Of course, a medical examination can be introduced before placing people in transgeners' colonies, but it's not always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of the inmates of Chelsea Menning looked like a man, and in prison he said he wanted to change the floor, said Alexeiev.
A man can feel himself whatever he wants.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve the sentence for transgeners, I doubt that prison officers will seriously consider the safety of such persons and seek their guidance or sexual identification.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lordikipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders into the colony could severely delay the beginning of the sentence of convicted persons.
A commission is a question of sex science, psychiatrists have long-term observations, and it is not a single test on which high-level opinions are based.
Today's mentality allows it to happen.
So before changing the floor, potential patients are always tested -- they're just showing whether the shift of the floor with the surgical intervention necessary, says Lordickpanidze.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how this system would be applied to convicted persons, since on average it takes a month to do so.
The doctor, although generally supported by the idea of separate units for transgenders, also doubts whether, under current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new facilities, medical assessments, to transgeners in Russia.
It's difficult to estimate that there's no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, there's less transgeners, and those who have such a bias and commit crimes, a very small number, said Lordipanda.
Currently, individual conditions of detention are available to men and women who apply to the administration of the colony.
Mikhail Antipov won the World Peace Championship in chess.
In Hunty Mansysk, the world chess championship for young people under 20 years of age ended.
The end of the first line seemed more than an intriguing one.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and he became a Russian, Mikhail Antipov, who was finally able to catch up with Jan-Kishashof Doudou, who seemed to have gone to his title.
A Ukrainian chess player, Natalia Boux, celebrated the victory.
The chess championship, which had been in Hunty Mansissk since early September, had seemed to have lost almost all of its intrigue by the time the Polish representative, Jan-Kishashof Doud, who had produced a series of four wins (the 13 tours in the Swiss system), had taken over with confidence the leadership.
Given that Douda was one of the top priority ratings, and is generally considered to be one of the most promising young chessists, the likelihood that he would miss out on the extract seemed very small.
And even when Douda lost his speed and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antitov to reduce the backlog to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious asset in the title struggle.
After all, Antipov had to win the 13th tour in order to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help, win Dud your party.
Plus, this obligation of victory, of course, could have affected the game of a Russian chess player and led to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipah avoided them.
He made sure of Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for his party to finish Doudah, who met Benjamin Bock.
Fortunately for Antipas, a Polish chessman threw up a fight against the Dutch whore.
So Antipov and Douda had an equal number of points, 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipas had better complementarys.
That is why it is he who has been given the leadership of the Hunty-Mansian Autonomous Region, whose Governor, Natalia Komararov, has traditionally devoted great attention to the development of chess in the region, and has been awarded the main prize.
But there was no intriguing ending in the competitions of the girls.
The leader of the tournament - Natale Buckse (Ukraine) - had enough to win the title to win the last tour, which she had done successfully.
So the victory of the Russian woman Aliena Bivol wouldn't let her catch up with Bucks.
The Russian athlete remained the second one behind the 0.5th point championship.
The millet changes the regional structure.
The company integrates the Privolga and Ural regions into one densely populated Volji-Ural Region, Siberia and the Far East into the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As Michael Slobdin, the director of the Wimpelcoma, notes, changes are being made to “remain a strong player in the market”, to develop a company “in new, not always favourable external conditions”.
In Mr. Slobdin's interview on Russia 24, he explained that they were intent on reducing "ten per cent" staff in Russia.
The plant examined 78 Moscow snacks by Burger King and issued 367 requirements.
As a result, a restaurant on the Voloskam highway was fined 50,000 roubles, and a large Tul Street facility was closed for 90 days but resumed after all violations had been resolved.
43 snacks violated the requirements for the installation of premises.
Among other violations were poor sanitation and sanitation facilities, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, and bacteria of the E. coli group were found in some facilities.
A franchise on Burger King's brand belongs to the Burger Rus network owner Alexander Kolobov, and there are 293 snacks in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, Head of FAS, stated that the agency was opposed to the 10 per cent indexing of freight tariffs and to the provision of public subsidies, as requested by the RWCO.
First they wanted 17% indexing, now they want 10%, and then they want multi-billion-dollar subsidies, he says.
We say, "It's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and right.
He added that FAS had its own “preciously more stringent” proposals, which were now under discussion in the Government.
Polium is considering a possible net basis option with Sumeru Gold B.V. Instead of carrying out a total of $300 million on stock, the gold mining company reported.
In this case, Polymethal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of equity for Sumeru and market quotes) that can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has time until 3 October to implement the option or to demand payment.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal don't reveal.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of the “Kysil” Politetal Project in Kazakhstan.

Minpromtorg: Targeted food aid will not be the equivalent of cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Eutukov, reported that the programme of targeted food assistance would not be the equivalent of the food distribution card system in the USSR.
These include modern targeted food aid for the population and support for an effective domestic product producer.
I'm asking you not to be speculational about "food card."
In particular, I would like to point out that the proposed product maps should not be confused with the resulting total deficits, the distribution system, where the number of products received is normalized.
So far, we've proposed the concept, if it's approved, we're going to propose changes to the law," he said.
Previously, the “Eight” wrote that the programme for the introduction of food cards for the poor had been introduced into the Government.

President Alexander Bobresov of RWD resigns from his post.
The WSA Vice-President of the Russian Railways (RWC) on corporate security, Alexander Bobresov, leaves the company, reports Interfax, referring to the source.
The Vice-Prime Minister of Russia, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the RWC, Arcani Dvoković, stated that the matter of withdrawal from the R.R.A. Alexander Bobresov had initiated a new head of Oleg Belozersov.
According to the Vice-Prime, the personnel restructuring of the RWC is not related to the change of the head of the company.

This year's study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top 1,000 Russian Managers" is being published at 16.
As a tool to assess the professional reputation of Russian top managements, the study summarizes the results of the work of Russian managers during the year by identifying leaders in sectors and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of last year ' s laureates.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for this year ' s rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list is invited to nominate up to 10 new managers from other companies who would be usefully added to the pool of candidates.
The following company functional directors may be nominated: Financial Director, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, Staff Director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Government, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert-proposed manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to 10 new managers from other companies.
The sectoral nomination is based on the industry classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forestry, engineering, media, metallurgical, multi-sector holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, services and consumer goods production, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical, energy and fuel complexes.
Each participant is provided with a logic and password for the entrance to www.top10000.amr.ru, where they can see information about the remaining participants and can present their estimates on the criteria proposed for each functional area.
The rating methodology is based on the “Best Choices for the Best” principle: top managers evaluate top managers and functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle provides for the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
Final ratings are approved at expert commission meetings.
All candidates for this year ' s rating and multiple past-year rating candidates are invited to attend the meetings of the expert commissions at night.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission to approve the list of top managers and eight commissions to approve the heads of functional areas.
The expert commissions are invited to approve the lists in alphabetical order (places maintained strictly according to the Internet assessment and are closed prior to the publication of the rating) or to update them in accordance with the attached list of stand-by candidates.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules of Russian language and the rules of “Early”.
At the time of publication of the rating, there could be changes in the status of managers and companies.
The investment rate is 10-13 per cent.
Experts estimate that the small and medium-sized business credit market in January and April of this year has a 40 per cent residence.
What do you think the situation is today?
Following the panic of the end of 2014 - early 2015, the amount of IAS lending declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
No one benefited from 25-30 per cent of the annual loans.
If the bank had previously been able to place all its possible problems in the future, from delay to non-return, it would be impossible to do so now: the rates are too cloudy.
For business, the current credit rate level of IAS is inhospitable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their return.
A rate level of 10-13 per cent would allow the business to invest in a wide range of projects and to generate attractive returns.
How much do you estimate to be satisfied with the demand for credit from entrepreneurs?
The situation improved a little after the CB dropped interest rate.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our findings, customers are less likely to apply for credit.
First of all, business does not understand its development prospects and future incomes.
Business today has one solution: it is necessary to learn to work on the basis of today ' s economic situation in the country and region.
There is a need to monitor current results more closely, to control cash flows.
At the same time, where financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and power costs.
All of this, in the end, enables the company to make the products more competitive and preserve the business even in a precarious economic situation.
What are the main trends in the IAS credit market that will be consolidated and impacted on its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast of a lower average rate would depend largely on the Central Bank policy, and the regulator was now demonstrating consistency in the reduction of the key rate.
However, it is not worth waiting for the IAS to fall radically.
In the current situation, inflation is primarily a problem, which makes it necessary to raise interest rates to produce real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even when the CB rates are lower.
In terms of delay levels, traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited both in cash replenishment and in economic adjustment options, will undoubtedly pose greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the proportion of poor loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how Mazda's word is written by Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, concise, and at the same time difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So the new CX-5 crossover, like any other stamp model: unbiddenly attracted from the outside, is technically perfect inside.
Japan is already simply being able, by virtue of its “Japanese”, to be attached to the products of the land of the rising sun to a state of full delight.
It's as much as you can argue for machines from other countries, and the person will agree, in principle, with these arguments, but the whole conversation will be separated from the final phrase, "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people must probably love not only technology but everything else Japanese.
It's not about kimono, of course, but about Japanese fashion canons: sweet, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps Japanese school uniforms are the only form that girls enjoy after school.
It has amazing properties, both sensitive and severe.
And the older the girl, the younger the fibber's shorter.
The main change in visibility CX-5 is the radar grid with five horizontal lines.
But where else does the shape of the car change in a new diagram of the lights and the rear lights, where the car will be instantly recognized in the traffic of the cars.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
The silhouette is harmonious, and the forms are sensitive, but the appearance is harsh.
You don't have to call the police.
The CX-5 drive, one of the safest in the world, can be tested only by Japan's stony calm.
A diesel engine of 2.2 litres shall provide a high torque at a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine is 175 l.c. - only 5.9 l. The power unit is provided with a purely automatic transmission and full power train.
Black shoes, black cloak, black bag...
To add a little bit of black humor to this image, you can pick up the lungs with a prince from the police tape Not Cross.
At Mazda, however, every effort was made to ensure that you were not on your own accident at CX-5 driving.
To further improve comfort while maintaining good control, the suspension re-designed the design of front and rear amortizers and optimized the shape of the front and bottom levers.
The full power system has been adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise from the road and the engine at high speeds has been reduced by 13 per cent.
A merchant in a flower or a strip is as bored as a budget sedan.
It's different if the girl is snitching in a bath with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in a role-playing gendarmerie.
She'll get no less attention then than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved design of both front and rear seats, providing the optimal reserve of space for the wide shoulders, and for long legs, who owns what.
Even more long - legged ones will surely appreciate that the obstinacy in the front of the central tunnel is now soft and does not hit the ankles in the expression.
The widest range of active security systems is proposed at CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to recognize potential threats.
There's also adaptive lighting here, and warning to get off the lane, and monitoring dead areas, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
A comfortable minimum performance containing a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are in proportion to 4:2:4 and each section is fitted with a separate lifting lever, increasing the luggage compartment to 1,560 litres.
The cartoon hero's suit in Japan is called kigrums.
It's especially too expensive to look like pijama cigars.
It's got everything in it!
Of course I'm asleep.
But also to entertain little kids.
Or just walking around like this in the street...
Because it's so great when you have a choice -- hairstyles, manners or cars.
Thank you for helping with the preparation of the material of the Kawacat store.
Kiev broke the atomic mind.
Kiev formalized Ukraine ' s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the construction of the Hemelnitzka Nuclear Power Plant.
The Supreme Council voted on Wednesday, from the second attempt, in favour of the dissolution of the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the restructuring of the third and fourth blocks were signed as early as 2010-2012, but the project could not be started.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed a law which terminated the 2010-2012 agreement with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth bloc at the Hemelnitzka Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill introduced by the Government could be passed only by second ballot, for the first time by 210 deputies, at a minimum of 226, and then by 234 members of Parliament.
The original project under the USSR, the Hemelnis nuclear power plant, was to have four power units of 1 GW with a type of VEAR reactor, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on improvement led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and the Council adopted legislation in 2011-2012.
Since no funds were available in the Ukrainian budget, it was assumed that blocks would have to be built on credit from the Russian side, but funds had never been allocated.
Following the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling between the two countries of Kiev, the relationship with Moscow in the atomic industry was reversed by announcing refusal to cooperate on the Helnitzka Nuclear Power Plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations remained remained was the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for active Ukrainian nuclear power plants (supposed about half of the country's electricity generation), as while Ukrainian NAC Energoat was replacing Russian supplies with nothing.
Plans for the upgrading of Hmelnitzka Nuclear Power Plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: as early as 2014 in Kiev, talks with Czech Skoda JS were announced.
UN-Gencing Against the Use of Military Force in the Resolution of the Syrian Conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported during a press conference that military means could not be addressed in Syria.
“The war has no solution”, he adds to AP his reply to the question of Syrian military support by Russia.
Mr. Ki-moon also announced that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the permanent members of the Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the UNB later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief Genstab of the Russian Federation, Nicolai Bogdanowski, reported that Henstab did not rule out the possibility of establishing a future military base in Syria.
So far there are no such plans.
"But there may be," Mr. Bogdansky said.
Previously, the US did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in the Russian Federation.
For a detailed discussion of the United States' doubts about Russian assistance to Syria, read the paper “The Russian Military Presence in Syria Concerns Washington”.
In the PA, OSCE reports on a possible meeting between the parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The Chairman of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Arthur Gerasimov reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in south-eastern Ukraine.
"What I know is that a meeting is planned this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," Mr. Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the mine agreements and “to return to the normal functioning of our countries”.
Asked whether, in his view, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level was currently possible, either in “the Norman format” or in the format of the contact group at the OSCE PA site, Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue had taken place, that there were mine agreements.
At the same time, according to the policy, any kind of dialogue is maintained in Kiev.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, the ex-President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donesh and Lugan Republics had not changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Electoral Commission of Lower Novgorod summarized the outcome of the municipal duum elections, with 12 deputies' mandates on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral irregularities have been made by representatives of the CPF who accused the selection of “falsification coverage”.
No comments were adopted by the opposition.
The sample also refused to organize a referendum on the removal of rents for the renovation of multi-family houses.
The City Selector officially presented the results of the elections in Lower Novgorod ' s pride on the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1.03 million voters were included on the voters' lists in Lower Novgorod, 746.7 thousand were distributed to the divisional commissions and 268,000 voted in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were allocated to political parties, depending on their votes.
The lists of "One Russia" include six deputies in the hallume, namely, Dmitriy Swatkowski, Dmitriy Krasnovu, Vasili Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasterjav and Igor Nagor.
The sole mandate of LDP was given to the leader of the party, Vladimir Girinowski.
The two mandates of the CRC are shared between Vladimir Bulanov and the Deputy Secretary of State Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of the “Russia Fair” are delivered to Alexander Rassowski, Igor Bogdanov and Michael Shalugin.
These candidates must now decide within five days whether they will serve as deputies in the city dume: if the mandate is abandoned, they shall proceed to the next party candidate.
The Chairman of Horisgorcom, Alexander Maceev, informed the members of the Commission that he had established duty stations “to send telegrams to Girinowski and others” with a view to abandoning mandates.
When adopting the electoral report, the representatives of the CPF stated multiple violations.
Member of the Horisgorcom, with the right of deliberative vote from the CPF, Leonid Krasnokutsky proposed not to recognize the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that, at the direction of the Head of Administration of the Sormov region, the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, had been closed.
The Udma deputies, the candidates themselves, and the observers could not have gone through the door for a long time, and the radio-resurrection scandal had been shown in tele-effer.
All observers and commissioners with the right of deliberative vote were able to attend the meetings of the district commissions.
The head stopped access only when the vote had ended and the divisional commissions had not yet arrived to hand over their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"The head was then corrected and interested persons could be present at all meetings," steamed a member of the mountains of Natalia Andruchin.
The Communists objected that, in the blocked administration building, more than four hours had been illegally held by the Zaklu District Assembly Deputy, Ludmil Aristov, for which an application had been made to the investigating committee.
The opposition also resented the fact that in a number of UCCs on election day, they began sealing the boxes at 6-7 p.m., putting in them ballot papers for early voting.
However, the members of the commissions, with the right of deliberative vote and observers, had not been alerted, so they had already come to the 8 a.m. election.
The communists are confident that during the morning hours before the opening of the polling stations, the ballot papers could be dropped uncontrollably.
However, the mountains, which had already dealt with more than 124 complaints on various grounds, said Alexander Maceev, did not find any violations of the inclusion of unaccounted ballots.
Members of the commission and their colleague's proposal from “Russia Just” Maria Popolo to cross a cross-section of regional legislation in order to clearly establish the opening time of envelopes with early ballot papers, which then fall into the urn.
"In order to take your own initiative, approach the CIC," advised Mrs. Popo Alexander MacKev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CPF, Sergey Samahin, shouted that the sample was ignoring dozens of complaints and covering falsifications in the elections.
"You're not here at the rally, be careful!" said the chairman of the pick-up meeting.
As a result, the protocol was almost unanimously adopted.
By 27 September, the selector must approve the overall results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the Sixth Lower Novgorod City Duma will be scheduled for three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the municipal electoral commission denied the Communists of Russia the political party the registration of the initiative group for a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties intended to raise two questions for discussion by the following townsmen: whether they agreed that the fees for the renovation of multi-family houses should be “immediately cancelled” and the tariffs for housing and municipal services should be “frozen until 2020”.
However, Irina Maslova's lawyer explained that the “Communists of Russia”'s application was contrary to legislation.
The FedEx revenue is mixed, and projections are reduced by 2016.
FedEx reported the disappointing results of the last quarter, and a giant delivery service had reduced the annual profit forecast due to lower demand for freight services and increased costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it planned to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time, FedEx reported last year that he would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares cost about 2.5 per cent of pre-sale sales 45 minutes before opening the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp stated that he planned to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ended next May, which is 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts were expected to be $0.84 according to FactSet review.
The forecast has been reduced despite an average rate of 4.9 per cent, which will come into effect on 4 January, and the increase in ground charges for heavy or large cargoes, which starts in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase revenue over the past year by reducing expenditures, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The Chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, stated that the company “worked on the basis of the weak in comparison with the forecast of economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
The recruitment plans for the holidays were announced the day after the competitor ' s application, UPS, that they planned to recruit an additional 95,000 employees, about as much as they were hired last year.
For the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, an increase of 6 per cent over the year before.
The share income was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per share by a 12 analyst survey of Zacks Investment Research.
Income increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zaks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a recession in the international urgent transport sector, resulting in a lack of growth in gross income in its express transport unit.
However, the Internet boom has dramatically improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the proceeds from land transportation increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained largely unaltered owing to increased costs of large shipping and self-insured services.
The express transport unit received higher income due to higher base rates, while in the cargo sector income fell due to higher pay costs.
In pre-sales, about an hour before the FedEx stock exchange was opened, it fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday by 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
At the most expected meeting in a few years, Federal Reserve managers will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from a Honduran red tree, deciding whether it is time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of the room, a large, decorated room for meetings on two floors will be lined with a walled image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must place the country ' s economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank has received a dual mandate from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and retain stable prices.
But since the Great Recession, federal leaders have recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third commission may prove to be an unknown factor in the almost predictable decision that will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to withdraw from the unprecedented incentive provided by almost zero short-term interest rates from the end of 2008.
Even though most data show a strong growth in the economy, recent shocks in the world financial markets can keep the federal system ' s already cautious leaders from adding valor by raising the federal fund base rate by only a quarter.
"It's obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise stakes, increased uncertainty around the world market would suffice to give them an excuse to wait," she remarked.
There is no consensus on what the Federal Reserve System will do, which in itself creates fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
The financial markets, however, are expected to hold the Federal System back from doing so, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent of the likelihood of rapid recovery.
This could lead to a decline in the equity market if the Federal System raised the rate, provided that decision makers did not mitigate the promise that the next increase would not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Doo-Johns index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was prompted by expectations that those who determined the Federal System strategy would leave the rate this week,” said John Lonski, chief economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research group.
"It would be a surprise if the Federal System raised the stakes at this point in time," he remarked.
If the management of the Federal Reserve System does so, “they will have to go a long way in adopting their strategy to keep financial markets in hand so that they don't panic”.
Other experts objected that an increase in the rate could calm the financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty as to how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seemed inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first little lockper in a slow tightening financial conditions that could confirm the strength of US reconstruction.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she was expecting an increase this year, despite the liberal complaints that greater economic progress was needed.
Although new jobs slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest in more than seven years, and at almost the level considered full employment in the Federal System.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
While inflation continues to fall below the central bank ' s annual 2 per cent target, the Federal System management stated that the temporary effect of the sharp drop in oil prices was the key.
“The economy can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the decline in the labour market,” noted Ian Sheferdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China had devaluationd its currency.
The Doo-Johns average index for industrial equity fell by 16 per cent relatively high in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in China’s economy could hinder global growth.
The market partially restored its position this month, and the Dou-Johns index is now about 10 per cent below the high value of May.
For the management of the Federal Reserve System, market resentment adds to the complexity of calculating the increase in interest rates.
“In the absence of information on what has happened in the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, they would have been huskying at that meeting”, said Stephen D. Oliner, senior UCLA researcher, Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former Federal Reserve Officer.
He now expects them to wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is great uncertainty as to what the consequences could be for the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data after the recent events in China”, said Oliver.
The health of the world economy is not a primary concern of the Federal System and should not be technically taken into account in these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become the world's financial power.
The Central Bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint of Ben S. Bernanke's then president in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could “slow down” its monetary expansion caused a global turmoil of markets.
In a world where markets and economic systems were increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the Federal Reserve would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other banks and experts in order to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “faster art than science”, noted Zakari Karabel, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that manages global state management strategies.
Jeffry Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System there have been cases of excessive reactions to financial market movements that do not seem to be related to economic principles”.
Laker, a member with the right to vote by the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on an increase in the rate, cited, as an example, the 1998–99 decisions.
The financial crisis in Asia has resulted in the Federal System reducing its base rate of 0.75 per cent for three meetings, “in spite of the limited identified effects on growth in the United States”, said Laker.
A year later, federal leaders cancelled these declines.
The federal reserve system should be given priority only in times of major crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozen, former member of the interest-point committee in Bank of England.
The last panic and not close to that level, he said.
"You would certainly not want to be in a situation where you are threatened by the rising rates due to the fact that markets are in shock," said Poznan, President of the Peterson Institute of the World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should go ahead of events.

According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of spiritistic theories, but the question is asked by itself, Is Europe the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic persistence in recent years, have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East?” he asked.
“Some certainly thought and knew that refugee flows, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who were fleeing death, would reach the well-being of EU countries”, he added.
Narishkin asked: “Have many European political leaders been frank about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that now literally surrounds their countries?”
"No, old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he remarked.
According to Narishkin, NATO is violating many European values and norms of international law.
“Europeans, unfortunately, have long been looking at and looking at the way in which NATO’s military sapes are retreating from the moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” stressed the Speaker.
Government forces and their loyal paramilitary forces are opposed by rebels, who are mainly Islamists.
Later, opponents of the Syrian Government were joined by the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in Russia.
The US supports both Assad and IG rebels.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria described the cause of the West’s hostility toward Russia.
The Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are actually sovereign States.
That was the opinion of Syrian President Bashar Asad in an interview with RT, First Channel, Rossy 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Asad, the West does not perceive partners or sovereign States.
In those countries, he would like to take away one person and place another who would act in the interests of Western countries rather than in the interests of his homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turnout of Western media with the beginning of a coup d'état in Ukraine.
He said that for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “has turned from friend West to enemy, king, dictator, who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power in an undemocratic way, even though he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the “Islamic State”.
Commenting on the continued statements made by the West that Asad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he did so at the request of the people, not at the decision of the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president will stay, otherwise he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad identified Russia and Iran as friendly countries and recalled that cooperation was being carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Referring to the military support of Iran, the Syrian leader observed that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, in the economy and in the military.
He denied the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is providing us with military equipment.
“Of course there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place”, he explained.
As for the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
"We don't see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Igilovian coalition known to the United States," Asad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000, and the number of refugees exceeded 11.5 million.
A part of the territory was occupied by the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in Russia.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Policy: Peace: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary John Kerry made a telephone call with Sergey Lavrov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia.
Reuters refers to the representative of State Department John Kirby.
It is noted that the subject of the discussion was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide additional details.
In doing so, he said that the United States had tools for “the further isolation of Russia” if it supported President Bashar Assad of Syria, handing over the RIA News.
As reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lavrov once again stressed the need to establish a unified front against terrorist groups operating in the country.
There were also discussions on ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.
Some bilateral issues were also raised.
United States officials had previously stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern over the strengthening of Moscow ' s support for Assad.
In Washington, D.C., it was stated that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, Mr. Dmitri Peskov, President of Russia, said that the country would not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of overthrowing the Assad regime.
Some of the territory was occupied by the terrorist organization “Islamic State”.
The International Coalition led by the United States exposes HG positions to air strikes.
Borodai described the American newspaper as a slanderous newspaper on Strölkov.
The former president of the Government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
That's what he said in a telephone interview with Lenta.ru correspondent.
The note at Washington Post is beautiful because it's all over the place.
The former Minister of Defence, Igor Strölkova, of course, did not bind or “get out” him from the territory of the Donbasa Republics in a very moody, unwieldy mood, with no ropes, without three turfs of money attributed to him by different characters,” he noted.
According to Borodaya, Strelkov’s talk with a reporter in the United States newspaper was really going on.
"Yes, I said that Strölkov was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said a former head of Government of the NAMA.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why an American correspondent had decided to write about the fact that Strölkov had been taken to Russia's “tied” territory.
I suspect it's provocation.
If it's not provocation, it's a strangely misinterpreted word, because I've stressed that Strölkov was leaving himself," Borodai remarked.
"It's slander both on me and on Strölkov," he concluded.
Earlier, on the pages of The Washington Post, there was an article in which Borodai’s words that he had taken Strölkov to Russia by force.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he had to connect his companion.
The Polish authorities started looking for a train with a gold Nazi.
The Polish timber industry has begun cutting trees above an underground tunnel, where a third Reich gold train is reportedly located.
Work started on Tuesday, 15 September, reports Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary to verify the reliability of rumours about the railway composition with treasure.
Arms and valuable minerals may be located inside trains.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Lower Polish Military Administration, Thomas Smolarsh (Thomasz Smolarz), suggested that the new evidence of a gold train was not more convincing than the previous one.
However, the authorities decided to chain the search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Peter Jukhowski, had stated that local archaeologists with a “99 per cent probability” had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich referred to in legends.
Zhukhowski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the jewels were discovered, they would become property of the State treasury, without the treasure being handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a law firm approached the authorities of the Polish town of Valbzhijih reported having found a train in a frozen tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The main drug policy of the Russian Federation proposed prohibiting tobacco sales to persons up to the age of 21.
Russia’s chief drugologie proposed to ban tobacco sales by the age of 21.
Eugenius Brune noted that before this age, “any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly harmful”.
So he said on live television at the "Guvorit Moscow" station, commenting on information that Speaker Soufeda Valentina Matvienko had supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
A man is suffering unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, and the individual is physically ready to do so.
It is mentally ready for a full life in society since the age of 21.
"It's known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is only fully ripening by the age of 21," said Brunn.
In the past, a member of the Public Chamber and head of the "Treaty Russia" project, Sultan Hamzaev, reported to the “Constitutions” that Matvienko had supported the initiative to raise the age price for the sale of alcohol and “agreed, together with the Public Chamber, to raise the issue again on the site of the upper House of Parliament”.
According to the activist, a working group will soon be established in the Federation Council to draft a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to verify compliance with the Law on Child Information Protection
The resident of Novosibirsk asked the Regional Public Prosecutor's Office to verify the Bible's conformity with the federal law on the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development, and a statement was read by correspondent Sib.fm on 16 September.
The author stated that on 26 August 2015, he had acquired a Bible from the China Town store in the Red Vision, which was published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the book, he found fragments that he thought violated the FH on the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development.
On 16 September, the application was accepted by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Novosibirsk.
A resident of Novosibirsk will respond within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, commented the complainant of Sib.fm. correspondent.
In addition, it is a fundamental problem that will affect society.
It will begin reading the Bible, something it had not done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatrics Rio Grandi promotes healthy breast-feeding food
The Brazilian Pediatric Organization SPRS has developed a scandalous method to convince women of the need for adequate nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves the display of images of babies suckling breasts, written by images of harmful food.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, of which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Because of the high energy needs of pregnant women and women who are born, it is recommended that the daily calorie rate be increased by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one increase in calorieity is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, Professor of Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition for pregnant women actually affects the exposure of children to genes and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of poor nutrition on the child ' s immune system has been detected.
Under Hamburg, a train hitchhiked a school bus.
In the vicinity of Hamburg, the train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the railway.
A 23-year-old driving woman who realized that she could not move from the rails ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a collision in front of their eyes.
He was filmed by one of the students.
The accident caused panic among the pupils.
Some children started to cry and run along the shoulder.
The route remains blocked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously injured except one passenger who was slightly injured.
The damage caused by the accident was estimated at Euro300,000.
Doctors call for bans on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) leadership called for the prohibition of boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr..
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in conjunction with the Filipino, Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles for the International Boxing Federation (IBF) version in the weight category up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with Magali's win in the 12th round.
Brown was in a hospital with a brain and skull trauma.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was connected to the life support apparatus.
At the professional ring, Brown won 22 wins, suffered only two beatings, and one battle ended in the end.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second fatality incident among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student named Bradon Smith died of injuries sustained at the ring.
AMA now recommends not to engage in this sport but, in her view, to ban it altogether.
I understand that this is taking place unintentionally,” said Vice-President Stephen Parnis.
But as boxing is now available, there will always be situations where an athlete receives a brain hemorrhage or trauma, leading to death or serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue living with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Sergey Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Committee of the Russian Federation, Sergei Narishkin, declared it unacceptable to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
He stated this when he addressed the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We view this as unacceptable action as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political shame and a disregard for the principles of open international dialogue,” said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the members of the OSCE PA to re-establish the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get morality back into politics.
Let us return to dialogue and law in the practice of international communication.
Let us return humanistic ideals to a democratic peace order.
"The two never had a good end," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group for Ukraine.
I call on members to focus on the following specific security challenges.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiation and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group”, Nariškin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
“It's almost the only common ground where we're still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine”, the politician stressed.
We will recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly was opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until 18 September.
Enjoyed winning for a couple or three days.
A world champion in a light athlete, Sergei Shubenkov.
The season is a triumphal season for a 24-year-old lighthouse from Barnaul Sergey CHUBENKOVA.
He managed at his 110-metre crown distance with barriers to European command, to set several record records and, above all, to become the champion of the world, the first in the history of a national barrier sprit.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final phase of the Brillian League by taking a third turn on the general score.
The New News asked Shubenko to share the impressions of the season.
Sergei, is the season over for you yet?
Yeah, I'm going to speak at the World Military Games, which will be held in Korea in October, and then I'm going to think about rest.
True, I'll be at home in Barnaul right now, but being home is still a different condition.
It's easier than every week to pray around the world.
You once said autumn was a loving time of year for you.
The end of August, early September, is a good time.
Fears after the major start of the rollover season, the burden of responsibility will no longer press.
It's a pleasure to compete on "slow down."
Plus, you know, vacation's about to be...
Is there fatigue?
Nevertheless, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Tired by the end of the season always accumulates.
And it doesn't matter what else you've been doing, winning or losing.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent flights, relocations, these things don't go on indefinitely for the body.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions on the rise, of course.
What's up, I'm just happy!
By the time you were finished at the Beijing World Cup, are you coming back often?
It happens.
And you journalists don't let me forget about it.
But in general, I think it's bad for an old-fashioned athlete who's been fighting his own successful race over and over again.
Enjoyed winning for a couple or three days and we have to move on.
The preparation for this wonderful season was very different from the normal one?
I can't say there was something so special.
We started cooking in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
Training was first home in Barnaul, then at the assemblies, then at home again.
It's as usual.
But the trainer was given the task of trying to reach a new level that I was not yet at.
It took almost all winter time to build a base.
We ran a lot of shoes, did general physical training exercises, which included both the thrust and the jury, and we rolled our backs.
Then they took on barrier training, and they did a lot of technical work.
Did the rivals follow?
I'm always trying to do it, there's no problem with the good news of the Internet.
I saw the European Winter Championship, and there the French took the whole pedestal in the barrier.
I thought I should do something, dilute this company.
Every time you start this season, you added and added results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've had all the last seasons around the same pattern.
There's no one I run first 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always untie my uniform gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused on this outcome.
But the paradox is that it seems like you're ready for the exploits, and in competitions you don't always get it.
How was it, for example, on the Olympics in London?
I, to be honest, tried to forget right away.
It was really good, it could have been 13 seconds away.
Even if I repeated my best results at that time, I would have become a bronze player in the game.
But it wasn't luck.
Remember your first World Championship?
What about it?
It was in Tegu.
I really wanted to get into the finals, it was a maxim program.
And he went away from the morning, in the pre-wars.
And then I realized that tearing and shaking my head means that there's no place to run.
Two years later, at the Moscow Peace Championship, Moscow was on its way to the finals with a better time.
I can't help but remember how I felt before the final race: I wanted to win the gold!
How do you do it by developing a good speed, not losing your head, not turning off?
That's the hardest part.
You have to be very careful, focused on technology, so you don't have to break down barriers.
I noticed that when you set up a process rather than a result, it's much easier.
The best part is when you feel like you're running and everything's going on itself!
I bet it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depths after the first major successes are trying to move closer to the capital.
Never thought like that?
Home's still better.
I don't know where I'm going without my coach, who needs me?
It may be good to have better conditions, but I try to be content with what I have.
How long have you been together with Klevsky?
Since I was 12 years old, I've come to light athletics.
Well, first I trained with his wife, who was working with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started off with a sprit, then I fell in the length, triple.
The child's polybolic was -- it's when a ball is met, jumps into the length of the place...
When I was 14, I tried running with barriers, and I enjoyed it.
From the first run, I was able to meet the standards of the second adult.
That's what I'm left with.
There was no fear of the barriers?
It's been a while since we got to deal with them.
But technology has always had a lot to work on.
Overstretched as much as I could!
But there's no way out of this routine.
The technician has to get out of the way all night so I can wake me up, get up, and run through the barriers.
All those who saw your race in Beijing say it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually re-examine my own runnings, and I couldn't hold on here.
But efficiency needs to be worked on; there are no limits to perfection.
Now don't you worry that winning the Olympics a year before the Olympics is going to be a heavy burden?
I will try to meet expectations, as they say.
Once you've chosen this road, you've got to go all the way.
My coach likes to repeat, if you're not weak, no extra cargo should feel.
And I agree with him absolutely.
Otara Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so sure that I'm so surprised to be able to respond to an interview in Ukraine.
People are mad, I understand their bread isn't feed--let's give it to the enemy.
And even though I didn't get into the flag, the same thing, a million times I talked here, and I didn't call anyone directly a bastard, I got another thing.
All my pseudo-friendly friends were washed away.
The pression I'm exposed to is so strong that even I, who has given out the kind of panties, I think people have grown white.
Like he was walking and walking, and you were attacked by a crowd, and you had to be mutated with paths.
But I need to know, I'm not a room eagle, I'm with my fist, I'm out of the house, I'm old, I'm afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so get a bite.
And you can give passports to assholes like Fred Derst or Monson, but you can't afford them.
I'd rather, the best journalist, work is shameless.
A week ago, in Kiev, Otar Kushanashili sharply described Crimean events:
What was done with the Crimea Peninsula is a crime.
That's what annexation is called.
I think the reference to how the scalding Khrushchev was trying to sign is by no means fit into the general picture of the human home.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking his shelter...
The war from the Kremlin is gone, and it will end only there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, she started by calling some bastard from the Kremlin.
I have any idea who it might be...
Cobson doesn't have much left to live.
I don't understand he's the greatest artist why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they took him down a monument.
Of course, people remembered him as an insult to their little family.
And now reconciliation is only up to Vladimir Vladimiricz.
Sunrise Seventh led the rating despite attempts by the Ninth to highlight the losses of leaders on Today Show
Carl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to highlight the impact of the Liberian Party's announcement of the release of the leader's seat failed to raise the ratings for the day.
The ninth morning show was broadcast from the capital of the State after Malcolm Turnbull's destruction of Tony Abbot.
The competitor, Sunrise, with leading David Koh and Samantha Armitage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
The torture appeared to be of little importance to Australian television viewers on a distance basis, with the Sunrise audience of 397,000 in five major cities compared to the Today audience of 339,000.
On Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), the number was slightly higher than last Thursday (343,000).
The day narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, it had 318,000, compared with 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September Sunrise has 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 on Today.
It's the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the clarification!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015.
An important news for the Seventh was the amazing debut of 800 Words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the recently widowed father of a family who decided to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 million.
Critics wondered if Thomson could handle a popular show alone without the Rafters Rebecca Gibney star.
The result of last night is a loud answer yes.
The X Factor Seventh remained strong with a audience of 1,136 million spectators, easily bypassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
The Seventh was mixed with luck and failure on Chase Australia's second night.
The first half hour (from 5 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.) of a new television station, led by Andrew O'Keefi, brought together 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seth Eddy McGuyer (6130,000).
On Monday evening, Chase Australia collected 520,000 viewers, and on the second half hour, they suppressed 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The fall in Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will make the Ninth quiet admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, who couldn't beat McGuyer's show.

Three finalists are unanimous in the fact that Sam Wood's a perfect guy, but who's he going to choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jevon-Feloughs, Sarah McCay and Snéjan Marcoski may have accidentally made it clear who would win the Holocaust.
A woman who will eventually be left with Sam Wood in the Holocaust is surrounded by a secret curtain.
And the three girls who reached the end of the day, of course, are silent about which one of them received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McCay, Snashhan Marcoska, and Lana Jewons-Felles on the eve of the day when two of the three girls were supposed to be left, they might give a hint of the winner.
Sam Wood steadfastly keeps his silence until the final, to be held on Thursday
All three women are in a lyric mood, telling them why Wood is a perfect man, while referring to his sense of humor, his sense of determination, his family values, his sense of happiness as reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But with their answers to the question, "If it isn't for you, who's the last race of Wood?"
Jewons-Felles and Marcoski have no doubt called MacKay the perfect couple for Wood.
From the first day on, Sarah and Sam developed a good relationship.
"From the moment I was part of the party, I felt the energy (Sara) and Sam's energy, and I realized that they were very close to each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about it," said Jewons-Felles.
"Sara is a very open man, very easy and fun with her," added Marcoski.
I saw them together, and there's really a attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah MacKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
McCay himself said that thanks to her home visits last week, she realized that Wood might be the very person.
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and my family, I realized it was not just a game -- I believed him with all my heart," she says.
To the question who should choose Wood, if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snowan and Lana deserve it equally.

Jarrid Hayn had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open day at the end of last year.
But Hein chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some of the coaches would have left Hein on the bench of the rest of the game for losing the ball, which the former Australian league player rabi had allowed at the first return of the pantat to a winning game with Minnesota with an account of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hein another opportunity to return the Pant, and also got him involved in the game after the trauma of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of putting newcomers in front of a team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hein at a press conference after the match.
The Special Reporter of 49ers Cam Inman reported that Wayne also received support from the coordinator of the special teams of Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost his ball at the return of the Pantheat by the Minnesot Wykings team during the first quarter.
The debut in NKL Hein and his numerous Australian worshipers were obviously not expected to do so.
You could see Hein fighting out of the field after losing a ball, and then he told the lead show "Hamish and Andy" at Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which he couldn't imagine a more unsuccessful start for a career in the NFF.
"That happens, you're just thinking about the next game and everything," said Wayne.
He compared his failure to a debut in the 2007 Origin game series, when a ball throw in his credit zone attempted by Queensland.
In the end, this experience has proved very useful to a 27-year-old player.
He took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and put it in Instagram.

There have been clashes between migrants and the police along the Hungarian border.
Refugees protested on the borders of Serbia near the Hungarian town of Reske, which had grown into clashes with law enforcement officials.
As a result, the Hungarian police used hydrogen and tear gas, transmitting Reuters.
Migrants are stoned to death by police and are trying to remove the fence on the border.
The scene of the clashes is reinforced and the police are responding to aggression by migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reporting the BBC.
The authorities allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and transport them from there to the country they needed.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the involvement of the army in the protection of the State border, the prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, and the accelerated procedure for the processing of asylum requests.
The Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border and will therefore be deported and unable to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider handing over border management functions to the Hungarian Armed Forces.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began the construction of a barbed wire of 175 kilometres along the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russian admitted to the largest cyberattack in U.S. history.
A Russian citizen accused of the largest cyberattack in United States history, Vladimir Drinkman, admitted to stealing over 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial in the federal court of New Jersey Drinkman, a conspiracy was made to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, a Russian citizen spoke of a conspiracy with three Russian and Ukrainian citizens accused of cyberattacks against 15 companies.
The total damage to the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Respondents like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security," said U.S. prosecutor Paul Fishman.
Drinkman's 30 years of imprisonment as well as a million-dollar fine.
When sentencing, the court will take into account the Russian confession and may reduce its sentence.
Drinkman's verdict will be delivered on 15 January.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smigina, was taken into custody.
The last of his crimes denied to him.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk, supported by Russia's Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone call with the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russian support for Syrian President Bashar Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risked exacerbating and exacerbating the conflict as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power”, says a communication published on the United States State Department of State website.
Kerry reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to combat the “Islamic State” (the activities of which are banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary of State, Asad “will never be able to be a reliable member” of the coalition.
Also during Kerry's telephone conversation, he stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of support for the Assad regime.
On the eve of the White House Spokesperson Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation unless it stopped supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest has proposed to join the international coalition that conducts an anti-terrorist operation against the “Islamic State”.
In recent times, the media have often reported the presence of Russian soldiers in Syrian territory.
To what the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, has stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have helped Syrians learn technology to use it against Islamists.
Four died when police fired rubber bullets at protests in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets in a crowd protesting the country ' s proposed new constitution, as stated by the official on Wednesday.
The violence took place Tuesday evening in Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Bischnu Prasad Daqal, head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had come from a police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police had used tear gas, then shot into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such a high mortality rate.
This confrontation was the last in a few weeks of violent protests in the southern plain of Nepal, where the Madezi people claim that new provinces formed under the new Constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests were also held in the west of Nepal, among the Taru citizens who wish to have a state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province, a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally managed for several centuries.
The new Constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
The legislators voted in favour of articles of the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials stated that a new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Saiansk plans to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Saiansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk province.
It was built in the 1970s as a centre of the chemical industry and has developed infrastructure requiring systemic support.
A year ago, Saiansk led a new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
The results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects, he told Awake!
Oleg Valerjevic, where did you start as mayor?
In particular, I have seen the results of financial and financial audits, and I have initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditure.
The municipal property was then audited.
One of the first practical steps has been to reduce document management to five days.
Previously, documents could have walked for months.
Income base and cost engineering activities have been developed.
In November last year, a retreat of the Government was held in Saiansk to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
There was no project/mixture documentation in the city for any site.
Without it, Saiansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started with the preparation of POJD on roads, kindergarten, northern sewer and water.
Road work is already under way on two sections.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demographics have not been observed in the city for the last 27 years.
So the issue of childcare is one of the most urgent for today.
Since 1 September, it has closed for major maintenance of nursery No. 10, for 320 places.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million roubles.
The city has never received such funds.
In the past year, kindergarten No. 23, which now visits 200 children, opened after the renovation.
Repairs were made under co-financing from regional and local budgets, with over 67 million roubles worth.
With the efforts of the administration and assistance of the Regional Government, funds have been sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People's Initiatives programme has also helped.
There are plans to begin construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the priority of children between the ages of one and one and three years.
We don't have reeds for children from three to seven years old.
Investors are interested in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city must be undertaken, first and foremost, by the Sayan enterprises, and it is they that must be employed.
Already in October, a 60-centre orphanage for orphans in Leningradska neighbourhood is in service.
With regard to construction, I'll add that Saiansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, which has been part of an economic class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 units will begin soon.
In all, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing for those wishing to participate in the programme.
One of the conditions is that housing should not be more than 30,000 roubles per square metre, which includes a “key” unit.
If we cope with the set amounts, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At the time, a Saian pig- complex was built and sold for a price-free sale in 2004.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to challenge this deal.
In particular, the land under the target is federal property.
Work is under way with Moscow, the issue of 88 hectares being transferred to regional property is being decided, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest in the reconstruction and launching of project 1.5 billion roubles.
With a bunch of pigbacks, we're going to have 900 jobs, which will help the city a lot.
A social partnership institute was established in Saansk?
We have about 140 social and economic partnership treaties.
Many projects have been implemented with the active social position of business representatives.
Enterprises such as the East Center, the New Zealand TEC, the Sayanese Bryler OO, the MDF KG, and the management of these enterprises respond to all requests.
Directly to the Day of the City of the United Nations, Sayanese Broyler donated children's towns to the city, East Centre renovated a horseyard where specialists dealt with the children's infections by spending more than 1 million roubles.
Thanks to sponsorship, the territory of the City Registry has been improved.
Sponsors helped to celebrate City Day beautifully.
As in old times, a parade was held with the participation of urban groups and organizations.
The story of the city, the book of the Seine poets, was released.
The first - century planners and those who have made a serious contribution to the development of Saiansk have been given anniversary medals.
Mechanats also participate in the city charity fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 roubles are aimed at supporting talented children, assisting children in need of expensive treatment, and supporting children from low-income families.
How are human resources problems in the social sphere being addressed in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and edifices in the city.
The provision of housing for professionals is essential to addressing the human resources issue.
Over the past year, we've allocated five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have received office accommodations.
We have a housing programme that can be privatized in five years.
Plans include re-planning a building where eight more apartments will be built for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in Housing for the Russian Family.
In the future, construction of a home for employees in the budget area.
Most importantly, there's a working team in town with which I can deal with the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential for Saiansk and our region is great.
A bill on social indexing has been introduced in the Duma, taking into account the rise in prices.
A draft law has been introduced in the State Duma to provide for the indexing of social pensions every year with effect from 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document, Mr. Alexander Lomakin-Rumyants, deputy of "Justy Russia", is also proposing an additional indexing of pensions on 1 April if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of increase in the prices of goods and services.
The social security index, according to current legislation, has been carried out every year with effect from 1 April, taking into account the growth rate of the pensioner ' s subsistence minimum in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law introduced into the lower chamber provides for the introduction of social pensions indexing based on the growth rate of consumer prices.
The first indexing is carried out on 1 February and the second on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA stated to Moguerini that sanctions against parliamentarians would not be imposed.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Federika Mogerini, the Speaker of the PA of OSCE, Iklka Kanerva, stated that sanctions against legislators participating in Assembly activities were not permissible.
This was reported to journalists by a Russian delegation at the fall session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar, Nicolai Koval.
The signatures of European parliamentarians, including the representatives of Cyprus, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, were collected in support of Canerva's position.
"There's already enough strong support," said Koval.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had expressed his intention to collect signatures of deputies that had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians were unacceptable.
In particular, Covalov noted that Kanerva had promised to raise this problem to the level of EU leadership and “to send a petition”.
NHC reports that 60 per cent of the probability of cyclone south of the Green Cape Islands is likely to be 60 per cent
The broad low pressure front of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Point Islands is likely to be 60 per cent of the tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday to the National Hurricane Centre of the United States.
Another well-defined low pressure area, about midway between the Green Mouse and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 per cent probability of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reported synoptics from Miami.
Google is launching a double donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launching of a double donation campaign designed to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping European refugees who are fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used a non-specific personal approach, denouncing the collection campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement made by one of the leaders, Google staff member Rita Masood, who had fled from Kabul when she was seven, described her personal experience.
"We went on questionable trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many people like my family are desperate for help.
Contributions will be made to four non-profit organizations that assist refugees and migrants: “Doctors without Borders”, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe is confronting the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, which was caused mostly by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has resulted in the displacement of over 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Obesity surgery can help with low obesity
The beneficial effect of obesity surgery for people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to claim that diabetes - free people live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
“The mortality rate is not evident immediately”, said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgeon who wrote about a new study in the column of the JAMA Surgey editor.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the ability of the authorities to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved to be effective for Type 2 diabetes treatment, but major studies have been carried out among people with Morbid Obesity with a body mass index (IMT) 35 or higher.
IPI, the weight of growth, is considered normal with a value of between 18.5 and 24.9.
IMI 25 or higher indicates that a person has excess weight and people with IMI above 30 are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your IM here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers at the Mi-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery: stomach bypass and llama gastroctomy, with type 2 diabetes treatment for people with low obesity.
The average CMI has fallen from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, CMI remains at about 29 for those who received non-surgery treatment for diabetes.
Of those who had undergone the operation, 36 per cent had been fully cured of diabetes, and 28 per cent had been partially cured.
In the group receiving treatment for diabetes, in comparison, there was only 1 per cent complete cure and only about 2 per cent partial treatment.
Moreover, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LPNs of cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors claim.
Researchers also controlled blood hemoglobin A1s levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in the blood.
Hemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, and researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at about 8 per cent.
But the best glymetic control indicators, reflected by the good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Chang Soo and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group that had received mitten gastroctomy, the bypassing group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), achieved a greater decline in the ITI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1s (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and was closer to a complete diabetic remission (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show the benefits of surgery in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment does indeed increase life expectancy, as reported by Blackstone of the College of Medicine at Finns, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study of obese people who chose bariatric interference, the risk of death for 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encouraged people with CMI below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important because it claims that such surgical intervention is safe in a low-IPI group where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease,” she stated.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors must begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient's ITI falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to make people take it seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate genetic changes that cause obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to reverse that.
In Mitisha, robbers took off the house with 9 million roubles.
In the Mystiques, robbers attacked the residents of the dungeon house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's coats.
This is reported by Interfax, with reference to the Ministry of Internal Affairs press service.
The incident happened Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people entered a house on the street of Gorski, tied up a 20-year-old son of a housewife, and threatened both with a knife, kidnapped 9 million rubles and three coats.
Preliminary data indicate that the damage amounted to 9 million,265,000 roubles, and criminal proceedings were initiated under the heading “Diversion”.
European fans are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will be visiting the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to obtain a permit.
In the opinion of the experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to world domination, the authorities will urgently have to think about how to settle all the guests in the city.
Rasbolt's interlocutors believe that the cost of renting rented apartments will increase by between 10 and 30 per cent and will have to be overpaid after the swap house championship.
The world football championship has led the authorities to draw attention to the status of Russian hotels.
According to a law specifically written under the originality, every hotel in Petersburg has to undergo a classification procedure and prove that it is in line with the stated number of stars and the level of service.
It is now understandable that not everyone will be able to do so: the hotelers are so afraid of testing that they often do not even issue documents for requests from the Federal Antimonopoly Service in Petersburg.
According to FFAS Head Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has examined 138 hotels and now plans to conduct 34 hotel cases, many of which simply did not respond to antimonopoly users.
There are indications that the management of three dozen companies has deceived citizens by placing a certain number of stars in advertising, as noted by the Lords.
The problem is, now it's literally every number, no one's going to lose before 2018.
The officials suspect that during the football championship, the fans will take over all of the Petersburg hotels.
Today, tourists can count on 30,000 rooms in the city.
According to Smolova, 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, and 550 single-star hotels in Petersburg.
According to Nana Gwica, the first Deputy Tourism Development Committee, only 23 hotels have now been classified - so many audits have been carried out by accredited companies in Petersburg.
Now, did any hotel order a similar procedure from regional enterprises, which is not known for the amazing circumstances?
I mean, there may be more of them, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months the hotels have not been very eager to be classified," admitted the director of the Northwest Office of the Russian Union, the tour of the Ekaterina Shadski industry.
This is due to the high season during which farmers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is that the budgets in which the verification costs have not been charged and that the procedure may cost the hotel between 30 and 100,000 roubles and more.
Recently, however, hotel managers have intensified and applied for classification, as Shadsk has assured.
Hotels must be able to work until 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine but will not be entitled to work at the World Cup.
It is well known that, depending on the starship, a fixed room payment will be made for the hotel during the tournament.
The formulas for which value will be calculated will be published next year.
This is done to prevent prices from rising by 200 to 300 per cent, as is the case during the Petersburg Economic Forum, for example.
You have to have a conscience and you don't have to raise it two or three times, but hotels have to make a living.
"I think growth will be up to 50%," explained the President of the Russian hotel association Gennaday Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimov is not sure that price recording is consistent with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how it fits into economic theory, but I hope it's justified.
"It's better to travel without restraint," he remarked.
It's not clear what's gonna happen to popular cheap hostels.
Members of the State have introduced a bill under which hostels must be prohibited in their homes.
It is highly hoped that this law will not be adopted or will not apply to Petersburg.
"We're going to defend the view that hostels should be preserved," Nan Gwachia says.
However, she said that the owners of the mini-entities should in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State approved the bill, about 80 per cent of hostels would be closed in Petersburg, and currently there were 15,000.
According to President Leonid Garbar, the President of the Federation of Restorators and Northwest Avengers, there are two or three-star hotels in Petersburg that are needed by football fans, but there is a distortion towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to the situation in which “in the 80th Millennium Stadium there are 75,000 pods”.
This can be rectified at the expense of small hotels.
Their possible ban is considered by the expert to be "idiotic": "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, and here's why they can't come."
If the hostel is used as a dorm, I agree it's wrong.
But if, as a hotel where visitors come for a short time, why not?
The small guests are at risk of missing the world football championship and because of their untidy nature.
Hundreds of small hotels will simply not be able to complete the classification process, and it will swarm on its own.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be required to work.
“Company, which may not carry out so much of this procedure, will refuse less paid orders from the mini-intentions, but will choose those who travel”, noted Hennadi Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, verifications have been carried out so far as to be well above those of Petersburg.
The delay in Petersburg was due to the constant relocation of the Government ' s tourist unit, which did not facilitate smooth work.
In the opinion of the experts, if the Peterburg hotels are not enough, it is likely that regional hotels and recreational homes will have to be brought to the attention of the experts.
Following the 300th anniversary of Petersburg, river fleets can be mobilized into the city, i.e. tourists can live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will be trained to arrive at overnight vans.
"It's not a good idea to set up enough hotels to empty them," I'm sure Gennady Lamshin.
Remarkable housing will also be popular during football pioneering.
The city is likely to have a reserve of flats.
Rental rates are going to increase by 10-30%.
“From the obvious - the first to leave the apartment near the stadium”, noted Larissa Bragin, an expert in the rental of the Agency for Development and Research in Real Estate.
However, the rental price may not return to the former level after the championship, especially in the bedrooms.
This will also be facilitated by the construction of new transport solutions on the outskirts of the city, she emphasized.
And the human qualities of citizens should not be forgotten.
Leonid Garbar, for example, is convinced that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city where people not only point the road, but can also conduct mini-extures.
There are also complications.
My father met a family from Murmansk in 1970, a father, a mother and two children.
They found it hard to stay overnight — hotels were hard to stay at the station.
"And Dad brought them into our communal apartment to sleep," recalled the interviewer.
True, he added that there's no such thing left in the city right now, calling his home is dangerous and scary.
But in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State, the mistakes of the hotels and governments will have to be remembered.
Zhirin's "lill" in the Amur region.
I was thrilled today to see Clounadu Girinowski in the State Duma.
He did things like this when our generation has just learned to trade in newspapers and is still in excellent shape.
The topic of the statement is, I think, “LDP’s protest against the results of the Amur region elections”.
The protocols do not shake, for nothing; other protocols, except those signed by the pickers, do not seem to have any LDP.
Here he comes up with Ivan Abraham, and he shouts something like, "This is the winner of the election!"
And immediately, nothing comes upon Rodney, and then, after he's had an argument with the presiding officer, he's removing the faction from the conference room, literally "You're all with your grubs and thieves."
The press certainly focuses, not on Abraham, but on the scandal and demarcation of the faction as a result of the scandal and insult.
The region of Amur along with Abramov was beautiful and elegant.
For the whole country, this is a regular output of Girinowski in the style of "Damnocks!", not a protest by the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has formally been subverted, and the elections, if you believe the Party website and Facebook of Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader on the subject is obviously tearing down.
Make the dead live on Amura for themselves to bury their dead and preach the good news against the One Russia in general and innocent of Rodney.
It's a great decision not to lose a face and not to go to a real one, not a show scandal.
Another matter is that Abraham himself is now in a strange position.
He had nothing to wait for, except for the superiors, there were no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, for a narrow circle, he has become a formal pretext both to insult the respected championship, and, more significantly, to the Ham attacks against the EP and the FNL.
And here, of course, he needs to think seriously about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the policy of number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 of the single regional single-mandate district can become a couple who have used their own party leadership and super-encourager to the same FNL and the party leadership of another.
Of course it wouldn't have been Girinowski who should have come up with and watched him with respect.
The tram is still growing and growing before it.
It was news that LDP would return to the hall during the next plenary.
I mean, the banya fell from nothing at all.
The only thing is, the subject of Abraham is buried.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" -- Dalai Lama -- RT News
Europe could not accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the continuing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre in Oxford on ethical research at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be greater than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while it was a source of admiration, Western European countries did not respond adequately to the refugee crisis.
"It's impossible for everybody to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama was very much aware of the response of Germany and Austria to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“The concern for thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you must think about durable solutions, how to bring true peace and present development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries”, he stressed.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to the violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, stating that the US's violent reaction had launched a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to the problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children swallowing a disinfectant for their hands over the past four years
The toxicological centres in the United States have reported an increase of nearly 400 per cent since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed a highly alcohol-containing substance, reports Georgia State toxicology Centre.
According to Dr. Heylord López, director of Georgia State toxicology Centre, the cases of children swallowing up to 12 years of hand-infection fluids reported to toxicology centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are in contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately they are sent to the ambulance,” said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children were drinking disinfectant specifically, and some were doing it to impress their friends or to argue for social networks.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking decontamination fluid as a cheap drink.
Young people were reportedly mixed with a decontamination fluid with a alcohol-containing mouth spray to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smells of disinfecting fluids.
"The child doesn't think it's going to hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most appealing (hand-decontamination fluids) are aromatics.
There are disinfectants for hand - smelling strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant for the hands contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Small children, especially children, may have only a few inflammations that can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It's a high concentration alcohol,” told Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician at the toxicology centre at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a whisky screen, but people keep in mind these disinfectants for their hands, and if the children get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naige Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently swallowed a disinfectant device at school with a strawberry scent of about four crucifixes, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her level of blood alcohol was 179, twice that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchi, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors watched her stay all night at a separate child clinic to avoid any sign of brain injury, as she fell and hit her head because of alcohol, and told Ritchi.
"It was very scary," said CNN Orthoria Scott, Naji's mother.
It could have been death for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-smoking substances or disinfecting napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant fluids for their hands from the children ' s reach zone.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some decontamination fluids are linked to death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as active.
In January, three four-year-olds in the north of New York agreed to poison their “opposing” teacher by “disseminate antibacterial substances in the classroom”, according to a police report.
The teacher has a lot of allergies for hand defactivators, and she won't keep them in her class.
The police believe that the plan failed was “pull talk” and addressed discipline issues to the school district.
Like the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the N.K. K. Mountain Children's Library, there's a tumultuous owl on its back.
The little ones who come after the books try to feed her with candy.
A few generations have gone to this library for 95 years.
The earliest readers of the past 20 years used loud readings, performances on Mayakowski verses, literary textaries, and correspondence with Lenin’s wife.
The census lasted four years, and as The Young Cliner wrote in 1939, “a friendship between the Hope of Constantine’s Kruplin and the friends of the Barnaula Children's Library became stronger every day.
The hope of Constantine even sent her children’s photograph to distant barnaulian friends once.
And when the barnaulans asked if the Hope of Constantine was opposed to having her name assigned to the library, they wrote that they did not.
Letters have long been dusted in the museum, and grandchildren and great - grandchildren of early readers have to explain whose harsh profile serves as a relief on the library building.
During the years of adjustment, people often called, resented: Why is the child library not renamed?
Let there be a library of names for a good child writer, without political colouring!
The library staff sat down, they thought, and they decided to leave everything there.
"Murish" is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, like "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow brick track.
"The Wizard of the Artificial City" is the favorite subject of an artist named Oly Moscow.
Ola used to be the manager of a legal company, to come to work at eight, to go at five, and all the other managers were different only from their love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet saying, "You need an illustration for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mom" -- "My mom's cancer."
Ola made illustrations, and thought that life could end at any time, and there would be no miracles in it unless you made it yourself.
She now works in the library, illustrates the children's books of writers around the world, and creates fairy tales herself.
Traditionally, children are thought to lose interest in a book that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we have children reading, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, and says "Rusian Planet" to the head of the Tatian Cushved library.
In recent years, we've even had a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and she's going to live -- the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the library lobby, there's a big exhibition with an up-to-date photo exposure.
Once in a block, new photos of readers go to the library for the entire family: Mom, dad, and children.
The library is glad that the popes are coming with their children more and more.
If the child was read all over Chukovsky at two years of age, he would need more books.
But there is now a law under which an eight-year-old Vunderkindu is prohibited from issuing books in category 12+.
To get a book like this, a child has to bring with him parents -- they come back, they come back again, and gradually "Murish" becomes something to them like a family club.
There's a treasure in the library, a pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and eras, to lead the King in the annex to the magazine Niwa, which is a 1936 Moorsil bound.
Because we're not only the conceptual space of the book temple right now, we're open to movement, we're trying to be a special place -- not home, not work, not school -- explains Tatiana Kushvid.
We can come together to read, play, paint together.
We've made a play area for kids -- the kid's just coming to play, and the hand's still reaching out to the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, but they resist with their feet, and they do not want to leave.
Mothers often come with wheelchairs, and we're happy that the library is put first among all the other places to come with the babies.
Tatiana Cushvid says that modern children like us once love classic child literature:
“The case is now evolving, and much attention has been paid to authors who are the intergenerational link”.
And when it comes to small children, it's important that they have some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like breaking up with their heroes.
The library regularly issues tracts for parents, telling them what is happening in modern children’s literature, which books are worth noting, and why.
The tracts are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden to remove books outside the reading room.
This magical privilege is only enjoyed by children.
In the outermost room of the library, there's a square hatch with an ancient wooden ladder in the basement, in the bookstore.
The little ones will be splashing under your steps, it's a very old time machine.
You see your childhood book like an old friend: Hi, good news, you and I are not changing.
Ellie's still on her way, dressed in yellow bricks, taking Tol Ryzykov's bullies, stealing magic matches, and Malcolm-Kibalcish never told the damn burgers of the Military Secret -- that's a strong word.
Books like passwords, you can find out where you're going.
There's a vault and a real book rarity -- for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and eras.
Or lead the King in a famous annex to the magazine "Niva."
Or "Murzyli" in 1936.
The pages were aged, and they were painted in tea.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, and I wish I'd retire and deal with rare children's books.
But the kids won't behave like that, and the paints in old books aren't very bright, and the topics... open the first page, and there's Lenin, party, commomol.
Now I think, why did we all write out this Pioneer Truth?
But it was still interesting, says Galina Ilasov's "Rusian Planet," who runs the bookstore.
The Murzyka pages have become dark from time to time.
Galina Vasilvin will lead a bookstore for the rest of his life.
She knows the color of Buratino's cap, in which school year Harry Potter became the captain of Gryffindor's team at the Davidic championship, in which situations Carlson uses a motorist silencer, and who works for Alice's father.
There is little money paid for the work of the library, and everyone who can live without these book series is finding a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced ones remain: educators, educators, ministers of the book.
You can find them by smiling -- it's thought to be the professional feature of a child's library.
If he smiled at you at the first minute of the conversation, that's a professional.
I love children's books: how do I like them to be on the shelf, and I love to read them,' says Galina Vassilvin.
I read everything: military, history, fairy tales, fiction.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different when I was a kid.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that happened to me at the time.
And since I loved them crazyly, I thought the library was a magic place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the lairs.
And I'm happy when our former readers bring children or grandchildren...
Hearing mill: There is no disagreement in the “Seltic”
Griffiths refuted the controversy in the Celtica after acknowledging Dale as "Hups" in a bad position, but he's gonna fix it.
Harts will protest the Scottish football association's claim to Neilson, and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt team unity
"Dons" increased the advantage over "Seltic" to five points
Adam Runy's Penalty in the first time gave Aberdin a little advantage over Hamilton in Pittor, which allowed Dons to break away from Selika for five points.
Griffiths denied talking about disagreements
This has led to rumours of differences in the “Seltic” that were suppressed by Griffiths, who claimed that he and his teammates suffered no further criticism in preparation for meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel stressed, I think the players want it.
Dutch people are bored because Scots aren't in the title struggle - where Bur
Former Rangers para-protector and former Dutch assembler Ronald de Bur stated that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Selik because he did not compete for title with Rangers.
Where Bur, now the representative of Ajax, said, "The Dutch no longer show the most attractive moments of the "Seltika" game, why?"
It's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Star Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
Old firm games have a lot of stress, and not only do people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'm all cheating," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtik was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
The defeat from Malmö, and as a result, 10 Aberdeen football players were soon lost from the champions' League, which now stands at the top of the table on the back of its eyes.
But Dale said, "The village had bad times before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very unfortunate, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And indeed, we really need the support of "Seltika," because this player is making it much better.
Staying together now is so important.
Warberton's waiting with mistrust for January's transfers.
Despite the views of just a few weeks ago that he had identified some of the objectives of January's transfers, Mark Warberton's Rangers' boss looked down on the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former attacker, Brandford, said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in summer, you have a period before the beginning of the season to adapt them, which you saw in our own group during this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Mitch, who's interested in "Seltik", thought he'd finished his career.
The Assumption Sunsi Mitch, linked to Celtik during the transmission window, suggested that he could leave football after his contract with Lesbians was completed.
A 29-year-old player suffered two years of ankle problems and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Harts is about to oppose SFA on Nelson's allegations.
Harts was kept to account 2:1 when Paterson was removed and 3-2 was lost, but the lawyer's red card was later cancelled; this is Collum's third red card, which was cancelled in eight months.
"I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tinckasla
Habernian's stubborn player received a speech after he admitted he sang a song with abusive words about former Harts player Rudy Scule.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh drby on Tinkasla in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was burning," said the attacker, adding, "I can't say with certainty that I wasn't going to go back to Tinkasla if he wasn't playing for Celtik."
Donnelly: Tannadis's advice is sure about Dundee United' management.
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United's board of directors remains confident that the management team will change things for the better, but agrees that the deterioration in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys out again," said Donnelly.
McInness is glad that "unappreciative" won at "Hamilton."
Derek McInness admitted that his team, Aberdin, had had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to win the seventh consecutive victory in the original league, which placed them on five points higher than Selika, at the top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runi's first-time toolbar.
McInness said, "There's not a team here that wins anything -- a cup or a league champion who hasn't won a meeting like this."
Unemployment among Scottishs does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is increasing
The Scottish security sector remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent higher than in the United Kingdom of 5.5 per cent, as reported by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number of workers now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland has dropped by a quarter to 74.0 per cent, which is higher than the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Minister for Scotland's Affairs, David Mandela, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The Government's long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy”.
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the labour market in Scotland, with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why am I a witness to the execution in Oklahoma?
Today, while avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will watch man executed.
If that happens, and I hope I don't, I'm going to sit on the death row at Oklahoma prison when Richard Glossip gets executed with a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
For the first time, this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story about the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since the results of the dark lottery often exceed places, they decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press places was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will sit with Richard Glossie's closest friends, and he and I have our own relationship after a few months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try and remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of being impartial in Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She acknowledged that she herself “could better formulate”, but still believes I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said it.
I told him he could get me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that transparency will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, the Harfington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the subcasters I wrote down.
I'm not going to go into detail here again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treze make him guilty of aiding the crime.
But I believe there's a great likelihood that he's not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that the evidence for the death penalty was insufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'll watch him die.
I can't say I'm going to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted.
I'll let you know what it's like to watch someone I love die without having to.
A person being prosecuted by the police was persuaded to leave the Kanning River
The Constable from Canning Valley managed to persuade a person to get out of the Canning River and to stay dry.
The resident of Perth intended to leave the police, but failed to do so by being stuck in dirty water in shallow waters a few meters away from a police officer trying to "smoothly persuade him to get off shore."
The Kanning-Weila police were summoned on Tuesday to enter another territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself into Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, come on, grab me," said Senior Sergeant Chandel Castledine.
Laklan Perhavez's Constable didn't really want to piss the uniform, so he used a safer reception - "a negotiation with a good cop."
"Somewhere people do weird things to try to escape," says Senior Sergeant Castledine.
That's what Ben Kazins' soccer champion remembers.
In 2006, Kazins went to the stand to avoid a meeting with a police patrol to check on alcohol and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts turned out to be in vain, but they encouraged the local people to invent the joke Ben Kazins' Beatlon.
Peter Moody accuses the stewards of trying to spy and threatens to leave the horse sport.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria's stewards of trying to put a spy in his stable last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
His target was the directors and ethics officers Racing Victoria, whom he accused of personally campaigning against him, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the start of the campaign because of the violation of the rules of use of drugs on the day of launch, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always made every effort to participate in the jumps, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive outcome of Lidari's experience with cobalt, which he cannot explain.
He's been speaking about suspicions of spying for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been through it for a long time, but sometimes it's getting you so out of line that you don't hold back," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to deal with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head lifted and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they think it's wrong, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody used to make a sensational statement during an interview at Racing.com that the Ethics Division was trying to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart sat in a room with a person I'll call if they ask him for a job in my stable to tell him what I'm doing in my stable," said Moody on Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all of us make statements because they have not succeeded in trying to catch me.
Robert Rawston, former president of RVL, David Moody, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sondrey, external executive director of RVL, knew it all the time and now they know it.
Shouldn't that make me think it's getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL take courage to hold accountable for what's happening in this business, other people than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I got to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and hold them accountable for their decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach's malaise was only growing during a long investigation into the occasion of the cobalt and Lidari, and the last decommissioning of the horse from the start forced him to state that he could "put his license on the table."
Moody, most famous for the unconquerable Black Caviar championship, described the requirements for the use of medication on the day of the "smart" competition after the horse was pressed from clay, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on jumps.
“I must be fully responsible for this,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly pressed her foot.
She could've gotten a press last night.
She could've got it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him the day she ran.
Moody can be disqualified for three months under the regulations on the use of medications on a day-to-day competition for the use of compression, which the stewards opened an investigation into.
It's anecdote.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's too far," said Moody.
The driver who had made the trip and who had fled the scene of the incident at Kabram was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcycle player in Kobram last weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was transported on a helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway this morning on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver had left without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected that he will be charged with leaving the scene of the incident, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic regulations.
A motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in a hospital in a stable state.
Craig Bellamy, coach of Melbourne Storm, paired up the allegations of rivals using hard force tactics
Craig Bellamy, coach of Melbourne Storm, described the criticism of his team's interception of the ball as “the imposition of the agenda” on the part of two NRL championships.
Trainer Sydney Rusters, Trent Robinson, stated that the judges allowed the “Stom” to “fight” with his team during the sudden victory of the “Stratem” in the finals of the Sydney qualification game on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet's "Brisbein Broncos" coach made a clear hint on "Ström" after his team won the final qualification tournament at "Nothern Queensland Kauboz" on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for the jigby league and said that two of the Queensland team were not "only successful" in a hand-cuffed grip.
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball by his team and said they were just focused on "Contact," intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was convinced by the criticism of his team by two leading coaches, which means that they are concerned about the possible defeat of the Side.
"This continues to float--I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about the tough receptions when they played us with 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can order that we haven't changed anything for a whole year in our systems or in our defense techniques, just in the last six weeks, we've paid special attention to contacts in the interception of the ball, and that's a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's clearly training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a shock to him.
It's funny, like it always happens at this time of the year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "smart football" by reminding his teacher that the St. George-Illawarr Dragons won the 2010 Winters championship by showing "tight" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and to see how impressive their game was," Bellamy observed.
I remember that in 2010, Saint George was a lot critical of calling him a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care about it at all.
But now he's got a team that can show what he thinks to be impressive football, especially their young para-protectors at their speed.
It's a football game you'd like to play when you have these players.
He made that observation in 2010, and now he wants everybody to play soccer in his style -- not every team has two para-protectors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play it.
This gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a bit worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the "Storum" and "Rusters" games were competitions with more points than "Broncos" and "Cauboss" games.
Broncos was probably good, I haven't seen her yet, but what was the score?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts -- and what is this impressive football?
Or are breaks and failed attempts impressive?
For me, it's routine.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
"The Party" at the end of this week's weekend because they won the right to take either North Queensland Cauboss or "Cronalla Charks" next Saturday night at the preliminary end of AAMI Park, tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
The accused of possession of drugs has been released on bail of $200,000
A man who is threatened with life imprisonment for attempting to ship 40 kg of cocaine to Queensland was released on bail of $200,000.
Marco Maximović, 29 years old, was one of five people arrested last month after the Federal Police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay boat from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Kumer in August.
During the morning, Maximović and his associates were seen at the dock and later met with them at the Cooma Roadhouse Cafe, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Despite the fact that Maximović faces a life sentence for trying to assign drugs in sufficient quantities to sell, lawyer Maximović argues that there is no evidence that the latter was trying to get the whole party, and that the man could have been in the cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximović was worth bail.
The latter has links to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
The mothers and others of Maximović were asked to make a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
“It becomes clear from the testimony of both, that the amount of the $200,000 pledge is too much of a financial burden for them,” observed Judge Flanagan.
But this measure alone is not sufficient to guarantee that it will not disappear, and the judge added it.
Maximović has been granted bail, provided that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passport to the police daily and observes curfews from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Caticaris, "I'm proud of the assembly of Greece that fought until the last seconds."
The chief coach of Greece, Fotis Katicaris, paid tribute to his team after the 1/4 finale of Eurobasket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was made up of some mistakes.
It was a big game, quoted AFP Caticaris.
We were preparing for a great performance game for Spaniards.
They tried to work in defense, but the errors in the defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland, "I will be entrusted with Kauna's functions by the CSA."
A new member of the CSA, Joel Freeland, said he didn't believe in the curse of the Armenians.
The British also expressed confidence that its new club would be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Eurolig in the next season.
I spoke to coach Demetrius Itudis several times this summer and myself, after joining the team, quoted "P-Sport" Freelands.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time of adjustment to the center's position, but at NBA, I've been playing forward more.
Now I'm going to have to take more action against the big rival center, but I've been doing this before, so I think I'm going to be able to do it.
The Armenians won the Euroliga last in 2008.
Since then, they've been on their way six times to Financial Four, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling that the team is gloating.
That's the game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's hard, I understand all the frustrations of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can do, we have a good chance to win the Eurolig, I really think.
I've always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSA.
As for the smoothness, I am not a superstitious man, and I do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, everything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals in front of games, I'm just listening to music, and I'm trying to relax as much as possible.
"For me, the "Roma" match will be special."
The chief coach of "Barcelona", Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the first tour of the group tour of the League of Champions with Romana with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the exact unit of his present and former team would not be private to him.
We will recall that Luis Enrique trained “flesh” in the 2011/12 season, but was unable to show up on the best side in Italy's capital.
I went back to Rome a few years later for which I had acquired some experience.
I have extremely warm memories with Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not important.
The main thing is to start in the League of Champions with the victory.
The August meeting at João Hamper Cup will not affect the action of teams in the nearest match.
I'm waiting for Roma's game she showed in A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Scrinchenko: Krasnodar has different options for attack.
The Acting Chief Coach, Urala, Vadim Scripchenko, in the lead-up to the 9th tour of the Premature League with Krasnodar, noted the diversity of the attacking schemes of the rival team.
According to the mentor, "bouts" have several models of attack games in their arsenal.
It will be held on 21 September and will begin at 16.30 Moscow time.
We'll play with the Krasnodar, and we'll see if we can get the official Urala website with the words "Screechcenko."
We've got a week of training ahead of us.
This team has different options for attack, multiple attacks, but we're not slow, so I think there's going to be a very interesting game.
In the lead-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is playing the game of the League of Europe against the Dortmund "Brussion," we're going to make a very good effort to win.
"Astana House can take points from anyone."
The "Astana" defender, Rocher Kanyas, after playing the first tour of the League of Champions group tour with the "Benfia" (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of the game of his team in the future.
According to the Khubeka, the Austans are able to pick points from any rival.
Even though the match was hard for us, I can say we played well, and we got the official UEFA website with Kanyas' words.
"Benfik" is higher in class, but in the home match, I think we can count on taking their glasses.
That's pretty real.
But first you have to think about "Galatasaraya" and then "Athletico."
In home games, we can take points from anyone.
Raphael Benites: "For the second time, Krystyana Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Raphael Beníts, chief coach of Reala, expressed satisfaction with the major victory in the first tour of the group tour of the League of Champions with the Schatter (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to Forvard Krishtian Ronald, who had become the author of three heads.
The match was difficult because Schhtter knows how to control a ball, and it brings up the official UEFA website with Benites' words.
The rival didn't have many moments, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I'm not saying that Real played perfectly, but we had enough of the golls.
I'm glad we didn't miss the balls and beat four.
Krishtian Ronaldo confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll say it as many times as I like.
Jordy Alba: "Crystyana Ronald cannot be compared to Massi."
The defender of "Barcelona", Jordy Alba, believes that no one can compare with his friend Lionel Massey.
According to the Spaniard, Krishtian Ronald's "Real" forage can't do that either.
- What Leo is capable of doing is no one can.
Even Krishtian Ronald.
I can't compare Leo to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona has not only a unique style but also a bright personality.
Daniel De Rossi's para-defensor, on the eve of the group tournament of the League of Champions with Barcelona, noted the importance of compactness and insurance in a game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will be held tomorrow, beginning at 21.45 a.m. in Moscow.
Remember, "SE" will broadcast her text.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team with great players, quoted UEFA official website De Rossi.
It's hard to play with blue granates because they have not only a unique style, but also a bright identity.
To keep them, we're gonna have to smell all over the match and protect each other.
The Masses are almost always successful when under siege, so we need to remain compact and organized.
Food hopes to get out of the U.S.A.S.A. at the "Glorious" match.
Holkiper Ska Ilya Erjov stressed that he hoped to be part of the army's start-up team in the next CK championship match.
The food went out for ice instead of Micco Koskinen for a 23-minute count of 0:3 and reflected all the eyebrows at his gate, and the fourth head of the SSA skipped after replacing the altar with the sixth field player.
The next match will be held against Slovan.
I hope I'm going to go into the next match in the starting-up, and I'm going to say "P-Sport" with Ezhov's words.
I'm not an altar expert, I'm an enemy myself, we don't have a pair of missing heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" played well, everybody has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I'd rather miss a bigger one, but the team won.
Shafarzhov was admitted to a hospital with a virus infection.
Lucy Shafarz has been hospitalized with bacterial infection, reports AFP.

The time frame for the restoration of the finalist Roland Garros-2015 is not yet known.
We will also recall that on Monday, Shafarjzov raised one line in the WTA rating and is now the fifth missile of the world.
Stephen Hogg used a girl's phone to force paedophiles to send pictures
Pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to question images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep, registered with the Internet service for sending messages, where he received a number of lewd images of children sent to her by another user.
The girl woke up and found the missing phone and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photographs, and then she immediately drew her mother’s attention.
The police came and saw five images, followed by a survey of computers found at this address and found “relevant” queries in the search engine using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told the police officer that he did this because it could be "involved" and then he would've pretended he was a cop to scare them."
The Commissioner of Justice, Eileed Robertson, reported to the sheriff's court in Dundee: "He said it's a passion, he's in love with people.
He admitted that he was asking for a computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and asked for more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw lewd images on the phone, and the accused was treated with a face-to-face rate.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road to Dundee, found himself guilty of indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating bail conditions on 25 January this year and not appearing before a court on 24 March this year.
The defendant's counsel, Gregor Sim, applied not to list Hogg as having committed sexual offences, since it could be proved that there was no “significant sexual element” in the offence.
Sheriff Alister Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, until he received certificates from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was taken into custody prior to the other remaining cases.
He was listed as having committed sexual offences even before the date of conviction.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe reads the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest State leader, fell earlier this year from a ladder leading from a podium.
It was unharmed, but the scene of falling was immediately broadcast on social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by statements by parliamentary opposition that they had received anonymous threats warning them from the use of Mugabe at the time of the address.
A month ago, they mastered the President during his address to the nation in Parliament; that is what Mugaba repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonezé, a member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning against interrupting Mugaba's speech.
"The communication came from a number that is not displayed, but is entitled "The Death," he informed journalists at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned members of Parliament that the inviolability was ending in the parliamentary building and that as soon as they came out, parliamentary immunity did not function.
A member of Parliament stated that the party led by Morgan Tswangirai was “anticipated” by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its programme of restructuring and reducing service delivery costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two listed companies, separating production of computers and printers from faster-growing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated reduction in jobs would amount to approximately $2.7 billion, beginning in the fourth quarter, as stated in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterrise”, stated Meg Whitman, Chairman and Director General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterrise will be smaller and more concentrated than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and the business portfolio will be broader and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are better placed than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterrise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and “will focus on providing previously unattainable integrated technological solutions” to companies, as reported in the company's statement.
This is the case with a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Pacard to produce electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called “the birthplace of the Kremlin Valley”.
Hewlett Packard is in the process of undergoing a major restructuring process with a view to moving from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is a step taken by HP, the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in the United States -- a new development in this sector based on the confidence that highly specialized companies are doing better.
Captain of Arsenala, Michael Arteta says his clubmates should support the injured Jack Wilshire before playing Dinamo Zagreb.
In talking to Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that only September was the time, and that if Wilshire's recovery was planned, nothing would prevent him from going back to play for Christmas.
Wilshire will miss at least four of the next games in England in the best of circumstances and, in view of what has happened, his participation in the European championship next summer remains in question.
Most recently, Wilshire was sure to finish the previous season with the only injury of the ankle and was about to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-separate training.
"This trauma doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not the rest of the bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not about the ankles or the injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but, as Wenger has also allowed, there is a risk of additional injuries to any player returning to the mid-cancer.
There is also an adverse trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire suffered 23 different injuries in six years since his debut.
He also played only 65 out of 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the "Arsenal" schedule more broadly, you can notice that in six of the eight seasons, beginning in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two premier League clubs with the highest number of missing days due to injuries.
Wenger recognizes the possibility of being stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improved injury statistics will continue in the last season.
"Sometime, when you're back in formation after the trauma, you're vulnerable for a while -- during that time, you need to restore your strength and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope that he will recover physically, and I am sure of it, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
The Arsenal launchs the campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with the Dinamo Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Victor Beleerin and Aaron Ramzi didn't come to Croatia, so it's likely that Mother Debusshi and Arteta will play the start-up.
Maybe Wenger will also be part of Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Giro instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep my balance and give a little break to those players who need it," Wenger said.
Although "Arsenal" is an unconditional favour in group F, the Maximir stadium in Zagreb is among the most suffocating in Europe.
Dinamo hasn't lost any of the 41 matches since they were able to spend the last season as the Invincible.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by a 3.2 - degree earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned the lesson learned last season, when the team was defeated in the game of the League of Champions of Monaco, and remains eager to lead the club to victory in the finals of the Champion Cup.
"It's an incredible Drave," Wenger remarked.
Arsenal has never done this before.
We were very close to our target in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm an internship realist.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FreedesFest: A comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of such stories appears, especially given the desperate need for men to be candid, now more than ever, while suicide rates among young men are at the maximum level of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the single largest cause of death among men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely than women.
In an effort to solve the problem of “Camping Against Unhappiness”, 2015 declared the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the centre of this battle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression found that if a patient has enough friends “in normal moods”, the chances of treatment double.
In a similar way, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends doubles the likelihood of mental illness.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it needs to be.
In an age when social networks manage communication, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often more valuable than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to be strong, loving, and successful, even if there is a sense of loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, total domestic values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship - which have a greater impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently observed, the creator of video games, money doesn't buy more happiness.
The virtue of Freeds is that they attract attention to it.
Each character was identified, not through his work, but rather by a person’s being involved with friends.
Yumor Joey and Chandler's constant embrace, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' breath on Rachel -- everything comes from understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully examining their feelings.
As Somaritics said to me, "my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and self-sensitized, stresses how even the smallest association of friends can be beneficial."
Often, men who approach us feel unable to speak to our friends.
The old teaching of living with this is strong, as is the sense that frank talk about problems can be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to my mind when I'm trying to propose longer-term mechanisms to overcome.
It highlighted the subtle moments of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of a outsider talking over the telephone helps people in times of despair, and long-term support comes from the immediate circle of family and friends.
So if you visit FreedsFest to Comedy Central this weekend, where you've fully restored the decorations, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk.
Or even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say, "Hi."
It is better not to guess what benefits friendship can bring.
The Freeds series shows the Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 series, by #FreesFest tag
De Maria's killing her goal by helping P.G. break up Malmö.
Angel de Maria, on the same basis as Blyssa Matudi and Edison Kavani, celebrates beaten balls at the Malmö gate.
Angel de Maria, debuting in the League of Champions, scored a goal, which allowed the "PW" to easily bypass Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel de Maria and Addison Kavani did their job when Parry St. Herman started his game in the League of Champions with a very convenient victory of 2:0 vs Malmö in Park de Prens Stadium on Tuesday.
Dee Maria killed a ball less than four minutes after his first game at the League of Champions as a "PSW" player to direct the French champions, but they missed out on a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani scored a 61 minute needle.
In addition to Real Madrid and the daughter Shahter in Group A, Parry had to get a good start in the game against the Swedish champions because they were not aimed at the skills of the plei-off, but at the continuation of the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the fourth grade.
They earned their glasses, but it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimović useless in the attack and to replace him later in a field against a team from his hometown and club, where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win houses or be guests in the League of Champions, so to win on account 2:0, to deliver problems to rivals and to play a great role in defense is a good start, even if there are other moments that we need to work on during the season," said Blanc.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, though I'm sorry we didn't hit one or two more balls.
Ibragimović returned after the trauma of one of the replacements on the Paris team, which brought her no two to the Bordo match in the First League on the weekend, but drove him back to Dee Maria's fourth-minute background.
The Argentine assailant was described as a player capable of bringing SAF to a new level in Europe after it was purchased from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran out of Marco Verratty behind the protection of Malmö, he beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Villande to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone was expecting an easy and great victory from SAF at that time, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who defeated the Celtist in plei-off to reach this stage, with nine world-level players in the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two supporters in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of the 34-minute strike by Nicholas Jurgech, when the ball passed past the far-off pan of Kevin Trupp's gates, they attacked very little.
But at times, SWW has been under the influence of ineffectual transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half failed to carry out at least five attempts, and then failed to process the ball killed by Kavani immediately after the game was resumed.
Nevertheless, he showed himself much more adept at precise pastures, and it was the pass from Ibrahimovic, receiving which, Dee Maria, sent the ball with a vicious blow, which passed the 52-minute route to the pants of Mimo Vland.
The second leg was finally killed after an hour's notice thanks to Kavani, and the Uruguayan shot down his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic had set up a ball that had been sent to the center of the field from left flank Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about getting back into the game, and only the interception of Wyland's ball from a very close distance prevented David Luis from increasing the final score before Esciel Lavesey's replacement score was counted at the end of the match.
Age Hareyde, coach of Malme, later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions was held last December."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
The qualifications are insufficient.
"Glory of Parry"!
It was a great match with them.
Glencore makes $2.5 billion to sell shares
Switzerland ' s mining and trading giant Glencor, which had suffered from a decline in commodity prices, had earned $2.5 billion in shares as part of its ambitious debt reduction plan.
A London Stock Exchange company, Glencor, made a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
A company that lost 57 per cent of its market value was trying to deal with the collapse of commodity prices, while China's economy was deteriorating demand and creating chaos in world markets.
As a result of the release of new stock at a concessionary price, the Glencor share rate on the London Stock Exchange took off on Wednesday morning bidding.
The shares jumped by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence under FTSE 100, which was traded by 0.69 per cent higher at the opening.
Glencor started selling $2.5 billion of shares last week as part of an extensive plan to reduce his 30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold new shares at 125 cents per item, i.e. with a discount of 2.4 per cent to the sale price on Tuesday.
It placed 1.3 billion new shares, which represents 9.99 per cent of the company ' s statutory capital.
Because of concerns about the continuing decline in the Chinese economy, the value of iron ore has dropped by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials have fallen by 20 to 40 per cent.
The White House confirms C Jinpin's visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official report that Ci Jinpin, head of China, would be arriving with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, the first Ci Qinpin visit to Washington, D.C., will take place on 25 September and will be a follow-up visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michel Obama will also welcome Ci Jinpin with Peng Liuan's wife at a government dinner the same evening after the two leaders are holding bilateral talks.
"The visit of President Ci Jinping will provide an opportunity for increased cooperation between the United States and China on general, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as for the Presidents of the United States and China to approach the issues in a constructive manner," the communication says.
It is expected that Ci Jingin, whose first visit was announced in February, will stop at Seattle to meet with the leaders of several major American technology companies on their way to Washington, D.C., and then go to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Ci Jingping are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyberspiones and China's growing categoricality with regard to the disputed South China Seas.
The beating biker on the Kutuzzow Shroud received two years of colony.
In addition, the court partially granted the victims ' civil claims to Deni Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
The Moscow Road Court sentenced Denis Mirzoev to death, who killed a motorcycle rider on the Kutuzov Avenue in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years ' imprisonment in a settlement colony.
He is found guilty under the article “Viction of traffic and operation of vehicles” of the Criminal Code.
In addition, the court partially granted civil claims to victims amounting to 1.2 million roubles.
During the debate of the parties, the prosecutor requested that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and that the claims of the victims be fully recovered, eight million roubles.
The accident in question took place on 22 May at about three o'clock in the vicinity of the 30 Koutuzov Avenue.
The BMW vehicle, which was driven by Mirzoev, crossed a sidewalk and hit a motorcycle rider on the side of the road.
The man died of injuries from his birth in 1989 on the ground.
Friends of those who lost their lives on social networks reported that the driver of BMW was driving at high speed and was on his way to the front of the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape responsibility, the bikers set up a motor run from the Vobie Mountains to the GUMVD Moscow Building in Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it became known that the investigation had detained the alleged perpetrator of the accident.
In Moscow a naked man who had been thrown into the temple was detained.
He was calm and did not commit any illegal acts, and the police handed him over to emergency psychiatric care.
A resident of Moscow, who had entered one of the temples without clothing, was detained by the Metropolitan Police.
Moscow reports on this.
As told by Andrey Galiacberov, Chief of the MoU Press Service in Moscow, the incident took place on Tuesday, 15 September, about 16:00, on the Kashir highway.
A naked man entered the temple of the Sanctuary, Nicholas.
He was calm and did not commit any wrongdoing.
A police uniform arrived on call.
The law enforcement officers waited for doctors from the emergency psychiatric unit and handed them over to the man.
They were 26 years old in Moscow.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakishev.
More than 40 orders and orders have been signed by the Governor of Tumen Province, Vladimir Yakišev, at a meeting of the Bureau of the Regional Government.
Some of them concerned funding for educational and health facilities in municipal education in the region.
In particular, funds are being allocated for the purchase of a bus for a school in the district of Bajetavdin and for the major maintenance of a regional hospital in the Kazan district.
As indicated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete major repairs to the second floor of the therapeutic office.
The hot and cold water, water, electricity and electrical installations, ventilation systems will be renovated, the building will be set up, the premises will be repaired, fire safety and energy conservation activities will be implemented.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi from 17 to 18 September, with the participation of the Tumen delegation, headed by the Governor.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcome of cooperation is described by the Honorary Consul-General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumeni Vladimir Schugl, who was a member of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorović, what are the tasks of the Sochi Forum?
A major event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, an important link between the two States.
It is planned that Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Alexander Lukashenko of the Republic of Belarus will participate in the plenary meeting.
The plenary and sectional meetings will deal with the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in implementing industrial policies, regulatory support and programmes of the Federal State.
The Governor of Tumen Province will address the forum.
I think that demonstrates successful, sustained interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of line ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be operational.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new and beneficial contracts and agreements.
I'll add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk last June.
More than 200 delegates participated, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important cooperation treaty was signed between the Tumen and the Minsk region.
The importance of our work is also highlighted by the fact that a meeting of a standing seminar has taken place in Tumena at the parliamentary meeting of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, the APC delegation of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training for agriculture, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the field of agro-industry.
You recently met with the head of the region and head of the city's administration.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with the Governor of Tumen State, Vladimir Yakushev, he spoke of cooperation between the region and the Republic of Belarus in today ' s difficult circumstances.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be addressed - they are needed to reduce the cost of end-user machinery.
Problems in the work of the Tumen Trade House of Belschina and options for prevention were discussed.
Important issues, as investment projects should work clearly and profitably for the region.
Reference was made to the further supply of the MoMA passenger and cargo equipment, the development of the UAO “MAZ” service centre, which was established in Tumeni at the TUATP-AO.
The discussion also involved preparations for the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the year.
Another topic of discussion was the conclusion and signature of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relationships promise to come to a new level.
The issues concerned the regional centre as well.
During a meeting with Tumeni Chief of Administration, Alexander Moror, we talked about the renewal of Tumen's bus park.
About 100 buses are already "dung to incense", requiring a new batch of cars from Belarus that will work on gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect is that the Tumen elevator plant cooperates with one of the leading producers of the OAO oil products Mogillifmash, receiving the components.
In my view, these activities could become more active in view of the programmes to install new elevators in the regional centre.
I will add that within the extended powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the Governor of Kurgansk province, Alexei Cocorin, during which the issue of increased trade and the supply of modern Belarusian machinery was discussed in Zaire.
A meeting with the Oms Governor is scheduled for late September.
The extended consular region includes five FF entities, but Tumena can be described as the district headquarters.
The region is a platform for many promising projects, including the work of an honorary geneconsul.
In general, such meetings are important and good in enabling many problems to be addressed directly and quickly, reducing their severity and fostering mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current circumstances, it is essential not to break the spell while continuing to work in the future.
Matt Damon is opposed to focusing on the ethnic diversity of people working in film production.
Matt Damon argued with Afro-American producer Effy Brown, saying behind the scenes that we don't need to consider ethnic composition.
During Sunday's Project Greenlight show on HBO channel, a prominent actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroin in the scenario selected for the project.
"Multiculturality is appropriate when you're putting a tape for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
Disgusting Brown, not believing her ears, bawled out "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Professor Ben Affleck and Farelli brothers joined Damon and Brown in the discussion.
"I would like the participants -- no matter who the director is -- to think about what kind of language the Harmoni image they're going to follow," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who's been beaten by a white pimp.
Leo Angelos and Cristen Brancaccio were a film producer who was strongly opposed to saying, "In the end, we can get the wrong thing."
After this discussion was shown on television, social networks blew up with unfavorative comments addressed to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at the video: "Explanations of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room is TOO BELOE, which is painful."
Twitter has gained more than 5,000 Rittites and 4,000 "Layers."
Damon's statements appear at the very same time when informed coverage of the racial subject in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement became popular throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colour population.
In February, singer Prince mentioned this movement at the time of presenting the applicants for the Albo Year ceremony at Grammy Awards.
"Alboms are still important," he said.
As books and lives of blacks, albums still matter.
More recently, Black Lives Matter issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News Officer Elizabeth Hasselbek about whether this group would be viewed as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," said the movement leaders.
It has recently been announced that Damon is on the list of participants of show business, producers and media magnets invited to visit the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met the Pope is unknown.
"American Ninja Warrior" rewards the first champion
A professional rock climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero on Monday night became the first winner of American Ninja Warrior's show, taking $1 million home.
On this sport show, whose 7th season has just ended, none of the participants have been able to go through all the stages of the road with obstacles.
In the final part of the season, two of the participants, Kaldiero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task was a 75 - foot - long [75 - foot] rope climb in 30 seconds.
Britten did the mission first and did it at the scheduled time, became the first athlete in the entire history of American Ninja Warrior, which was an exhausting stage 4, but Caldiero did it three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
After winning an incredible job, Caldiero, who was shocked by winning a million dollars, interviewed E News.
"It's incredible to think about it, I've never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year," commented Isaac to journalists E!
And then all of a sudden... I never even imagined what it was like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wid met with journalists "The Hollywood Reporter" to talk about the final and why Britten, who was the first to pass the route, won't get any cash prize.
According to the rules, money gets the fastest participant.
"If the top players are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them," Ued said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes lives, it is still a source of great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels hurt about it.
He's happy with what he did.
He's got tons of excited fan feedback.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was supposed to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if we had changed our roles.
The Americana Ninja Warrior show will be back with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers is quietly bypassing Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers is now the last in the Central Division of the American League.
The only thing you can do is to be an obstacle to Tigers with a bluff winning on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with 5-4 on Targate Field.
"Twins" missed a chance to reduce the backlog of Houston Astros's half-games and to take second place in plei-off by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroits, even for one night, it was the return of the word to F, which slipped away from them most of the second half of the season.
"All winnings are fun, no matter how much they get," said the manager, "Tigers" Brad Osmus.
The pirate for Tigers, Alfredo Simon, made his contribution in support of the attacks, resulting in Detroit getting three points in the first two innings and then adding another in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pilot at 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third qualitative start in nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good performance," said Simon.
The pirates can't stop playing every game, so I want to get into the game more deeply.
Viktor Martinez, the assigned "Tigers" reflector, was able to beat down three blows and get two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strikes from the four strikes against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He was a good bat," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (the quality of) the bat, and he kept that quality to his play.
By taking three wounds in the second half of the seventh Inning, Twins got their best chance to get back to the game.
The central host, Byron Baxton, has opened up innovating on the left side of the field.
Reitfield Aaron Hicks took the first base, and Second Baseman Brian Dosier got a strike out of Simon before he took his seat by the leftist Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked past Moer, the only player on the road, before the newly appointed reflector, Miguel Sano, who beat the two-track "sing" to the left of Drew Verhagen's right-wing man.
With a pair of Ranners out of a car and comparing a wound at the second base of Ver Hagen, it was possible to bring Trevor Pluff's third bassman to the point of reflection.
It was the 27th time for the top league player in this season, when Pluff hit the ball on the far-down.
After Detroit added a backup wound in the first half of the ninth Inning, Moeer earned RBI “debt” into the space between the Autfields against Bruce Rhondon's closing pirate, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-wing player had beaten Sano after three strikes and had received his fifth seve.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily unprincipled Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
Tigers had three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved player who was on the list of injuries until the game, missing more than a month in connection with the inflammation of the lumbar.
"It's definitely not the start I'd like," said Hughes, "but as the game developed, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to do some pretty good things in the third ing."
After the first beta got to base one, Hughes threw down the single to Ian Kinsler's second bassman.
The eye, with two i.e. i.e. i.e. raithfield J.D. Martinez, pulled out Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his "0 in 21" series with Rangers in an effective position.
The third base player, Nick Castellanos, followed the lead by another wound, but Victor Martínez was beaten in an attempt to get closer to the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
Tigers increased the score in the second inning, receiving a one-way "debt" from Kathecher James McCann and a two-aut single of the central reflectant Anthony Goose, which became 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager, "Twins" by Paul Molitaire.
He didn't beat very well, but he got right into the right spot.
Hughes, whose eyebrows were thought to have been thrown into the missing points of the third Inning, was then replaced by the right-wing revolver A. J. Ahter.
He was three wounds for six hits and an eye with four strikes.
NOTES: Anibal Sánchez, a pirate right-wing player, left the players in connection with the extension of his right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's shoulder surgery back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injuries since mid-August, is scheduled to leave on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sánchez, Daniel Norris, the player left the list of injuries and went against the Twins.
Norris, who left Tigers on four occasions from his acquisition in exchange for David Pryce, on 30 July, has one victory and one defeat.
He hasn't played since 20 August because of the sprain of the muscle.
Tigers and Twins will end the three-game series on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be played by Erwin Santana's playmate-rights (5-4, ERA 4.73).
Kadyrov's original complaint on Molba's book to God was filed with the South Sakhalin court.
In the Southern Sakhalin City Court, the original appeal was filed by the representative of President Chechnya Ramzan Kadirov on the decision to recognize as “extreme material” the book Molba Towards God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam, with reference to the President of the Horud Alexander Chuhrai.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the participants in the proceedings.
The Chukhray refused to comment on statements made by some members of the State Duma of the Russian Federation that it was necessary to test the Horrud for possible cooperation with foreign special forces and IGIL.
"Let them comment on such foolishness," he said.
On 11 September, the Sakhalian City Prosecutor's Office appealed against Judge Natalia Perchenko's decision to recognize the book as “extreme material”.
An appeal came from the South Sakhalinsk Public Prosecutor ' s Office on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the Public Prosecutor ' s Office considers that they have asked the court to declare extremist only the author ' s opinion, rather than the Koran ' s ayats.
In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision,” said Chuhrai.
The decision to recognize the book as “extreme material” was adopted on 12 August 2015.
In particular, the sayings of the Quran, “We worship you and pray to You for help”, and “Do not call upon anyone besides God.”
Kadyrov called the decision makers on the book "chaytans and Enclosures".
He called on the State Deputates to prohibit by law judicial decisions relating to texts of sacred writings.
“I firmly believe that the State of Duma must enact a law prohibiting judicial decisions relating directly to the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures”, wrote Kadyrov in his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intend to remove posts and comments that negatively assess migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about illegal content.
Combating xenophobia and racism on the network, Facebook management intends to work with the Ministry of Justice of Germany.
The previous day, for example, Heiko Maas, the head of the department, had stated that the ministret was currently working with social media professionals to establish a special group of processors.
The participants are required to monitor and remove inappropriate comments on migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors oflerant posts will receive notifications indicating why they will be removed.
Organizations whose professionals are collecting user-related social media complaints of abusive posts should also facilitate the operational closure of illegal content.
The Facebook management intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements directed at migrants and refugees, the management of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was made after xenophobic sentiments had increased dramatically in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis in the European Union some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all refugee accommodation facilities are already overcrowded.
The authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced displaced persons from countries in the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks, where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In Moscow cemeterys, there will be relaxing zones.
In the near future, several capital cemeterys are equipped with specialized areas for re creation and psychological rest.
Among the first are the Butovsky, Domodevsky, and the Shrebine cemetery.
The first psychological recreation zone has already appeared at the Troekurov cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, such sites will be available in other parts of the city.
The portal, m24.ru, was described by Artem Ekimov, who holds the post of Head of the State Budget Institute, Ritual.
Relaxing zones will represent small green areas that resemble parks.
According to experts, in these coals, visitors to the cemeterys will be able to rest, be alone and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxing zones will be built in Domodovsk, Butsk and Shrebine cemeterys, and then in other parts of the capital.
According to the head of the GB “Ritual”, if the area of the cemetery is to be expanded, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest mass to the maximum extent possible.
Green plants will serve as living fences that will separate recreational areas and areas directly placed in burial sites.
The Ritaal GB experts also announced their intention to make a proposal for the removal of fences on graves.
New cemeterys can really be barbarous.
In addition, Ritaal told GBU about the readiness to deal with the installation of electronic terminals that would allow visitors to know GPS coordinates and plate numbers of graves.
In June this year, Ritaal, GBU, also proposed an adjustment of the cost of burial services according to the time of the year.
All right, summer-time graves will cost thousands of roubles cheaper, weeks of winter, when the earth freezes.
Note that over the past year, prices for all kinds of ritual services have averaged 10 per cent.
Five days later, a lost fungus was found in the Hellenic woods.
An elderly man found himself alive, although spending more than a hundred hours without food in the forest.
Joint efforts by rescue workers and volunteers have helped to locate the mountain grave.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "79-year-old pensioner from Tambow province spent five days in the woods."
No food and no water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even quinologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was identified after a helicopter had been involved in the search.
On that day, Vitali Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods to pick up nuts and paediatrics, but by evening he had not returned.
The family immediately sought help, and the next day, rescuers and inequitable residents from a neighboring village — about 30 people — were raised to search for a fungus.
A helicopter from the Fire and Rescue Centre joined them for the fifth day.
Andrey Seletkov, the chief of the search and rescue team at the Smolen District Fire and Rescue Centre, said, "The Vertolet was attracted, the man was found."
He's gone very far, completely elsewhere.
It was about 12 kilometres from the search site.
He's gone a huge distance at his age.
The miracle remained alive.
The mushroom was taken to the Elenin district hospital unconsciously, in a very difficult state.
He was diagnosed with pneumonia, as well as severe body dehydration and recooling.
As an elderly man was able to survive after five forest days, doctors do not represent him at all.
Valentina Nepsha, director of the Elenin C.O.S.A.'s therapy: "A patient's examination, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Given all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains difficult, but with a positive development.
The pensioner Vitaly Alexandrović arrives every year at the Smolenshna from Tambowsk district.
His grandson says Grandpa used to go out to pick mushrooms, but he never got deep into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, the grandson of the fungus found, said, "Les is not far from the road, but is not really local."
I've been visiting my family for a couple of years.
Well, I followed the mushrooms.
I guess he went far and got lost.
With the start of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all parts of the Smolen region.
In the last few days alone, there have been five similar cases.
Saviours remind us that we need to walk in the woods in bright clothing, with a small supply of food, matches, and compasses.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces so that they can then be returned.
Emergency An-2 sat on a proset in a fraternal taiga.
Right on the run in Siberia, emergency An-2.
Annisey, a red - eyed aircraft, landed on an emergency landing 68 kilometres from Bratska.
There were no casualties and no casualties, but the aircraft itself suffered significant damage on land.
An-2 made a service flight.
There were three crew members on board, a commander, a second pilot and a manned man, saying "Interfax."
The aircraft flew along the Railway-Ilimsk-Achinsk route, where the airline was based.
The plane crew has already been taken to Bratsk.
The Brother ' s Transport Prosecutor ' s Office, following the emergency landing of AN-2, began to verify compliance with air safety legislation.
An East Siberia Transport Prosecutor ' s Investigative Unit went to the scene.
In September 2010, the Toe-154 crew landed its passenger aircraft due to a technical problem at the abandoned secret airport in Goma.
Engines and electronics were denied on the line, but the crew did not.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured during an emergency landing.
West Economics — Nobel Laureate: globalization
The processes of globalization should have contributed to reducing inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, the income gap in developing economies is growing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to remedy this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to Eric Maskin, chief scientist of the International Institute for Analysis and Choice of NIUs, Nobel Prize winner for the 2007 economy.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced an unprecedented increase in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more open.
Supporters of globalization had predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in a lot," says Maskin.
China and India, for example, have received significant per capita GDP growth.
But not everything is so happy.
Globalization was expected to narrow the gap between the “indigent” and the “poor” in poor countries, which showed large income inequality and, more precisely, pay.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article “Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequality in Developing Economys”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by NEES.
Together with an economist, Professor Michael Cremer, of Harvard University, Eric Maskin, developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income disparities in poor countries are increasing as globalization increases, and reminds NIE WSW.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Muskin sets four skills levels - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, experts D from poor countries lack the skills to work with professionals A and B from rich countries.
And if wage earners from poor countries are growing through cooperation with employees B from the rich, D growers do not feel or are falling at all.
The resulting effect is that internationalization of production will contribute to widening the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thereby increase inequality.
Cremer and E. Maskini are offered an amazingly beautiful model, alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality,” said Fouad Aleklers, professor general, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions, head of the mathematics department of NIU WSW.
And as a powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this field.
The solution is, according to Eric Muskin, an increase in the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, workers themselves, according to the scientist, do not have the means to do so, and companies are not good enough to pay for their training.
In such a situation, Governments, international agencies, NCBs and private foundations have a significant role to play.
The scientist notes that the theory developed does not in any way call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has produced and produced results in the growth of the GDP of countries.
Derbent: a living time connection.
Derbent is one of Russia's most ancient cities -- in September he commemorates his 2000s.
In the celebration programme, a festival of national cultures of the Dagestan people and a fair in the style of the past, an exhibition of the Derbent carpets and Open Temples Day, a historic and music show 2000 in two hours, and a tour of Peter I's reconstructed museum.
The medieval stones of Naryn-Kala, the old Arabic inscriptions on the walls, the narrow streets and palace gardens, all seem to have come off the pages of the Thousands and One Night.
Derbent is Russia's only city that has remained in place since ancient times.
Though claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Hazara Caganate, and the Golden Ord.
The age of the eastern plateau, which grows in the court of the Jebrent Duma Mecheta, is a few centuries old.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russia Program “The Trees of Nature”.
A shadow of scattered kroner saves pilgrims and tourists during summer heat.
The mosque’s visitor will be fed with aromatic tea and the Dagestan lacquer -- honey figs, fur, musmula, sweets, airanas and sweets.
In Derbente, large handicrafts have been used for centuries to have many guests at one time.
An inscription over the entrance to Djuma Metchi says that the building was built in 115H.
I mean, 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It's Russia's oldest mosque.
The interior is impressed by the scale and solemnity of the Arks of the domes and joints, which are based on square columns and lit by the sunlight from tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is the traditional attraction of Derbent residents.
The owners of domestic birds place pigeons in courtyards, under the trees, on the attics.
A capturer of sight will take hundreds of white pigeons up into the sky, just like the flashes of a festival fireworks.
For defence against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
Up to 300 feet [500 m] into the sea, this structure locked Derbent's harbor.
In 2003, Derbent ' s fortress walls were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient fortifications.
The carpets in Derbent continued in the fifth century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the city’s markets, street carpets are sold for any taste, such as coats of wool, cotton or fork of all the colors and shades, with and without a wart, with a complex design, and an amazing cassava.
The construction of the city began with silencing blocks with single - story stone structures.
Over the years, the mermaids haven't changed much.
Only satellite plates, wall conditioners and street lights remind you that you are not in the medieval city but in today’s city.
In the old part of the city, the details of a plumbing system built by Persians about a thousand years ago were preserved.
Today, ancient sources of water have been reached.
Many combs prefer ordinary tap water from verified historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the potter's centres.
The bowls of water and painting, the dishes, the dishes, and the cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The potter’s hands are still producing excellent pottery, both in practice and in gift use.
On holidays and festivals, a crowd of visitors gather under a tight rope on which students of the Republican School of Circutical Arts speak.
The history of amazing and risky skills has lasted several centuries.
The new trend is that girls are increasingly seen among the passersby.
There's a museum in the former Girl Bane's room today called "Culture and Home of the Old Derbent."
In the past, unmarried girls and brides accompanied by friends were bathed here, and now anyone who wishes can see a fast-scaling hall, hot and cold pools left behind by the bathtubs.
Most Derbent houses have hot water, but baths and couples are now as popular as they were in times past.
The benefits of heating the body are recorded in ancient books.
After the bath, blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, and the body becomes flexible and light.
The Community Festival, which is held on Naryn-Kala, is attended by ethnics from many areas of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk tunes, sing the songs of the Caucasus people and offer visitors delicious home cheese.
Cyrachal is the burial place of forty martyrs who have laid their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most respected complexes for the Muslims of the Northern Caucasus.
The yellow sarcophagus have since been removed from whole stone blocks and have been directed, as is customary among Arabs, towards the western axis.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubova cut and steal customers in a small cabin near the Upper Market.
Pariqherski has been here for many years.
The receptions of the cigarette trade are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the brothers of Jakoubbah can do not only a traditional hairstyle but also a modern haircut.
On one of the streets of the Old City, there was a house in which Alexander Bestuje-Marlinsky, who was sent to the Caucasus, lived.
After learning the Turkish language and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third century with his ancient monuments, life, and family of citizens.
Chihana is a traditional Eastern club where only tea and homemade tea are served.
Men come here to covet, talk to friends and solve some sort of work problem.
As in past times, women are not encouraged to break the threshold of tea.
The Derbent Dance Company “Cappy” was established three years ago, but has been able to participate in activities at the republican and Russian levels.
Soloists rehears each day in perfect folk accidents, Darwinian, Tatian, Armenian dances.
As evening approaches, when noise and street lights are on fire, local residents are placed on benches near houses that perform terraces.
As a general rule, they discuss domestic issues.
But in the run-up to the anniversary, they are increasingly reminded of the unique history of their city, which affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Cape region.
The Domodeda had a business game at the airport.
A new form of education is being introduced into the capital city.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport staff.
To this end, the Domodidas built three aircraft models.
Not only did young people inspect and register passengers but they also served airplanes.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but it was difficult not to give up on reality.
The late flights, immediately two passengers with fractures on board, were lost somewhere on their way to the plane.
For a real airport, Hell.
For the man who's based in Domodida's hangar, the standard set of tasks to be performed by newcomers.
In one hangar, three large airports from around the world were located immediately.
They now have four hundred students from capital colleges and colleges.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the interior world of airlines.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, luggage trafficking, they were entrusted even with buses on the flight field, stairs and passengers' searches.
And passengers, you're gonna make trouble.
One mess with the documents, the other one's late for the flight, the third one filled the bag with suspicious objects.
And we need to figure it out as we live, at the minimum.
For each of these tasks, they are paid a certain amount, virtual money, as if they had been paid by the airline for servicing the flight.
“For failure to perform their tasks, a fine is imposed on them”, explains the Vesti-Moscow Financial Analyst of the game, Dmitri Hilko, in an interview.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely following the events.
For them, this exam is an attempt to test a new form of education.
She has already been placed in secondary vocational education.
“There will be six interregional centres of competence, which will in fact be new models of modern colleges with modern management systems, highly skilled personnel, modern equipment”, says Natalya Goldareva, Director of State Policy in the areas of training and additional vocational education for the Russian Federation.
But the students aren't about global plans.
After three days of training, they seem to need a weekend.
However, the examination was evaluated in a very material way.
Newest smarts, the best ones I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding in a timely manner to our Instagram airport claim," "I'm pleased with the participant, the director of the Aeroport Frankfurt team, Sergey Schwalov.
The best judges, known as the judges, were on the pencil to be invited to work at the time of completion of their studies.
The United States Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the foreign literature of the United States Centre.
The Centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian Government ' s unilateral decision to close the US Embassy ' s American Centre at the M.I. Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
“The recent multilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation call into question the commitment of the Russian Government to relations between Russian and American peoples that have not been interrupted even during the cold war and other difficult times in the long history of our countries”, says Ambassador John Tofft of the United States in Interfax.
The American Centre established deep and strong links between people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was a center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital and served as a venue for meetings with numerous American eminent persons, including astronauts, artists, athletes, academics, politicians and writers.
“Just last year, the American Centre held more than 400 cultural and educational events and hosted more than 50,000 Russian visitors”, stressed the diplomat.
Tfft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Educational Exchange Programme.
The Green Tribunal was quickly put to death.
Typical situation: Four officials stand in front of Judge Swanter Kumar ' s table, hearing his claims for work done.
The Court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order for you to make fun of it,' said Kumar.
If there's any other brick, we're gonna have to tear down all the existing buildings.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal has been able to consider more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The rates are enormously high: India has become one of the world ' s most overpopulated and polluted countries in the 60 years since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development.
The problem is particularly acute in large megacities, where infrastructure development is slow to catch up with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with heavy silts, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few remaining residential areas are being built into new residential areas.
Despite the formal support of the State for green movement, NTAs are regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi because they are often the main reasons for the abolition of the largest investment projects.
For example, in May of this year, the Minister of Environment described the court's decisions as “extraordinary” and “unimplementable”.
Sometimes the court ' s decisions cannot be carried out within the court ' s time limit, confirming environmental counsel Raj Panjwani.
However, non-fulfillable deadlines have a positive side: at least they force the responsible to move.
“His main aim is to upset this system”, adds counsel.
The Green Tribunal has already repeatedly cancelled major construction projects: it has stopped construction of an airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
For example, during a discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagnan State, which contaminated the local river with fluoride, people are also being tried to remember.
We can close your factory, but we're responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," commented Kumar.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people whose lives may change by means of a single plot of judicial pen.
For example, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, thereby causing popular indignation.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and criticism, Swutter Kumar refused to reverse this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Delhi Government on entering and leaving vehicles and proposed to purchase 10,000 additional buses prior to finding out at factories if they were in a position to do so.
As sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to be brought to the attention of the courts, people’s anger began to subside.
But the most painful theme of the principled judge was the Ganges River Clean-up Programme, which was sponsored by Prime Minister Narendroy Modi last year.
When it comes to Gange, a Hindu - sacred river, the judge often ceases to control his emotions and turns to screaming.
You know what the word "saint" means?
Someone poured water from Ganges into a statue of God, and there were fecals in it, and the judge was on fire.
You keep polluting the river because you think Gang is the Gang, he'll take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship and see what you do to it every day.
The clearance of Ganga is the most ambitious and costly environmental project sponsored by the new Government.
The number of fecal bacteria in this river is now more than 120 times higher.
Every year between 1.5 million and 3 million of the 700 million Hindus bathed in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganga Rescue Fund money derived from the sale of his suit, in which he met Barak Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the Prime Minister of populism: The suit was purchased for $700,000, while the river’s treatment required at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India has a long way to go before it can identify itself as a developed country, but do not believe that the cost of progress should be green.
“In a developing country, talk about the environment is often perceived as an unacceptable luxury,” says Malik Bhanot's activist called Ganga.
And the court is trying to find the golden midway between the environment and development."
The man's bleeding down some of Dali's paintings at Riga Exhibition.
A visitor to an exhibition by the Latvian Union of Arts in Riga broke the windows in the museum and ruined El Salvador Dali's sculpture of the Angel.
The museum is currently in the process of exhibiting the works of El Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
A man born in 1985 entered the hall of sculpture at 2:20 p.m.
He did not act properly. He ruined the sculpture, broke the windows.
Then he started moving around and bleeding several permanent exposure works.
Among them is a portrait of the Cysts of Mervaldis Polis.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Artists, Igor Dobochin, quoted by Interfax, the screens have also been damaged.
Police and artistic experts work at the scene.
The latter shall determine the extent of the damage and damage.
A criminal case of bullying has been instituted against a man.
The Latvian Union of Arts, from 4 August to 27 September, has an exhibition on Picasso and Dali, which presents more than 200 original works of artists.

C Jinpin calls for a more inclusive economy
The economy must become more open to the world to spur its growth, as President Ci Jinping said on Tuesday in addressing the reform leadership team.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness”, he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Committee's central lead group on the comprehensive deepening of reforms.
He said that increasing openness and deepening reforms would give the economy new impetus and strength and give new space for economic development.
The Leading Group has adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of regulations on market access for investors, the amendment of border controls, the promotion of State enterprises (SOE), private capital attractors and the revision of the resident registration system.
It is stated that a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually improved through pilot programmes.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more meaningful role in the allocation of resources, the rule of law in the business sector and increased openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken control over the authority vested in companies, thus guaranteeing that companies will run their own businesses.
The statement also stated that China would allow border regions to adopt new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
More will be available to private investors to increase the openness of State-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The Government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign financing companies and provide them with better conditions”, the statement states.
The procedure for applications for permanent residence permits for foreigners, or Green Card, will be further facilitated by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the submission process itself.
The meeting also discussed the promotion of the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
