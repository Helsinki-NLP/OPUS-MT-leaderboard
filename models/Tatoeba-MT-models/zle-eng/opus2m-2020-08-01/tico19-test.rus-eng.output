The rapidly increasing incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and Great Britain between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is similar in the European Union/European Economic Area and Great Britain, thus reaffirming that, despite different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, there is a need to increase preparedness for the influx of patients from COVID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, in the province of Hubei, China, there were several cases of pneumonia of unknown ethics.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of the infection was a new species of coroner, now known as a coronavirus of severe respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-COV-2 has been referred to as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, approximately 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 have a slight disease, i.e., respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with the majority of those suffering from the disease being cured.
Approximately 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe form of hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent take critical form when intensive treatment is required.
The death rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
This study analyses trends in cumulative diseases of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and Great Britain and compares them with those in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEZ and in Britain with those for Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEZ and Great Britain
Since China ' s outbreak, COVID-19 has extended to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is now developing in the rest of the world in accordance with the same trend as China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic COVID-19.
In the issue of Eurosurvellance of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the existence of the disease.
The three first confirmed cases in the EU/EEZ were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of them returned from Uhan China ' s Hubei province.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections were detected in all 30 EU/EEC countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, of which 1,750 cases, including 1,441 fatal cases, occurring in Italy alone, between 31 December 2019.
Definition of cumulative quantity and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (EDRC) updates the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world every day at 8:00, from official sources such as health ministries in these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse and compare COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEZ and Great Britain with those in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases, COVID-19 was calculated to be a complete cumulative disease of COVID-19 in 14 days, taking into account the normal flow of COVID-19 in each EU/EEZ country and Great Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We have also provided the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 on 15 March 2020, compared to the figures for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in the development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and Great Britain
The trends in the development of the ubiquitous cumulative disease of COVID-19 during the 14-day period in the EU/EEZ countries and in the UK generally corresponded to trends in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in Britain as a whole began to rise approximately 21 February, and a sharp leap (additional material) occurred on 28 February 2020.
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and Great Britain there have been similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EE and British countries, compared with the figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to this data, the total number of cases already recorded as at 8:00 on 15 March in 15 other EU/EH countries and in Britain is comparable to that recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results indicate a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEZ and Great Britain.
The observed cumulative trends in COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, different responses by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases of disease and different rules for patient selection for COVID-19 analysis, including “precision” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 required intensive therapy, while the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already as full as possible.
To date, data on the arrival of patients from COVID-19 to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EH are only available for 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases respectively (not reported).
However, there is a need for systematic collection of such data in order to supplement current surveillance data, which include the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a 2010-2011 study, Europe has a large number of beds in intensive care and intensive care units, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care offices per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated report of the ECDC on the results of the risk rapid assessment for COVID-19 presents scenarios for modelling the utilization of health system resources with estimates of hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EE country and Great Britain, where the risk of lack of access to beds in intensive care units exceeds 90 per cent.
As cases are currently grouped into certain regions of the EU/EEZ and Great Britain and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, information on cases of infection and number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to provide, to the extent possible, level 2 Nomenclatures of territorial units for statistical purposes (UTS-2).
Italy ' s experience and current trends in other countries show that the EU/EEZ and the British COVID-19 pandemic are developing rapidly.
Thus, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for a long-term scenario of SRS-COV-2 contact, and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive treatment, which can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the last report of the ECDC on the results of the rapid risk assessment, the operational, proactive and integrated approach to contain the proliferation of ATS-COV-2 is essential, with a subsequent shift from a deterrent to a minimalization, as, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have sufficient time to understand, take and adjust their responses accordingly, unless such measures are taken in advance.
The report on the results of the rapid risk assessment also listed public health measures designed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time in which they can intensify their verification efforts to slow the spread of ATS-COV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks of the health system in other EU/EEA countries there will be an influx of patients who will need intensive treatment.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coroner of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-COV-2) was a tragedy for humanity: at present, over 3,000 people died in China and elsewhere in the world and more than 80,000 people were infected.
Like the SARS-COV homological virus that caused severe respiratory syndrome among thousands in 2003, the SARS-COV-2 may also be transmitted from flying mice and produce similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower incidence of disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on new diseases, this article offers a relevant and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject matter of the study.
We will consider basic aspects of epidemiology, ethics, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help us to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The spring holiday (Chinese New Year), which fell on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and memorable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and many weeks after the outbreak of the new virus infection.
In view of the high level of coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 called the SARS-COV-2 virus, and the associated disease a co-infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country, followed by almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been identified, more than 40,000 patients had been cured and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the bar number one for society” and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months more than 200 publications on COVID-19 were produced, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, ethics, diagnosis and treatment, beginning with the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the order of the virus from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to consolidate research findings in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with Sars and other corona-induced disease, the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts about prevention and forecasting of the current disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronnaurs have traditionally been among pathogens that are not fatal to human beings and are mainly responsible for about 15 per cent of general respiratory diseases.
However, in this century, we have faced two major pathogens of human beings, namely, the coroner of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV), which caused the outbreak of disease initially in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other States with the appalling severity of the disease and the death rate.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronary infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, for the first time, the National Health Commission of Uhan on 31 December 2019 reported cases of pneumonia of unknown origin.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case in Uhan was recorded.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medical personnel was reported, suggesting that human transmission of the virus could be made.
On 23 January, a quarantine was introduced into Uhan, and urban public transport was terminated.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronary infections had direct contact with the seafood market in Uhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the coronaviour outbreak was a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to some 50 other countries around the world (figure 2.2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final extent and risk of outbreaks remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ulBi-HX_RHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
Sars-CoV-2 infections have been exposed to all age groups, but mainly to people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few under 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
Infection of ATS-COV-2 among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/1000,000).
COVID-19 was distributed mainly in Hubei Province and in nearby regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days passed before the diagnosis was performed from the time the symptoms of COVID-19 were detected.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
From the time of symptoms to death, an average of 9.5 (4.8 - 13) days took place.
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the corrected R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infections, which coincided with large-scale transport prior to the Chinese New Year celebration.
The mortality rate for confirmed patients was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and the adjusted mortality rate for patients was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
Three main risk factors in the case of COVID-19 were: sex (male), age (-60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Crownfish are a sub-family of large cloud viruses containing one single thread of a meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta baroques are known to affect people.
In the event of damage to the SARS and MERS types of glycoprotein of shelled schizophrenia (S) is linked to cell receptors of angiotensin-precipitating enzyme of type 2 (ACE2) and diptides-4 (DPP4) respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.
The citoplasm is released by the virus RNA genome; after replication of the virus genome, the genome RNA, together with the glycoproteins and proteins of the nucleocapsis, produces violet-containing vesicules, which then merge with the cell membrane released by the virus.
The first reports on the genetic sequence of SARS-COV-2 were received on 10 January 2020.
The SARS-COV-2 has been found to be a new type of Betakornaurosis whose genome is 99.98% the same as the 10 consecutive samples collected at the first outbreak of disease in the Huang seafood market.
Genetically, the SARS-COV-2 is closer to the SARS-COV than the MERS-COV.
The SARS-COV-2 particles were detected in the human breathing effluents by means of an illuminating electronic microscopy.
It has been determined that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for the SARS-COV-2 as well as for the SARS-COV.
However, SARS-COV-2 is linked to an ACE2 enzyme that is weaker than the SARS-CoV, which explains that SARS-COV-2 causes patients to have less serious diseases than the SARS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-lived protein coded orf3b and secret protein coded orf8.
The cell orf3b of the SARS-COV-2 virus can play some role in terms of the virus's pathogen and suppress the IFN; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a team of authors headed by Zhou (Zhou) presented reports on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the ACE2 full-scale enzyme, with a clearance of 2.9 , in a complex with a transporter of amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which included open and closed co-information, had been collected as a smoker and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S-proteins, which was evidence of coroner identification and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress the infection of SARS-COV-2.
Origin and interim owner
Both SARS-Cov and Mers-Cov are known to have been the flying mice from which the virus was transmitted to man through the cyvet and camels, respectively.
By means of a phylognetical comparison of the SARS-COV-2 with other coroner viruses, it was found that the first owners of the SARS-COV-2 were volatile mice, since the new virus was 96% identical to the SARS coronaviruses, namely, the coroner viruses of the SL-COVZX45 and SL-COVZX21.
However, it remains to be seen what kind of intermediate master has become, which has enabled the virus to overcome the kind of barrier and to infect the human being; the transmission is still to be found.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the vectors of the virus from flying mice to humans had become snakes, during which the homologic recombination in the S-protein had taken place.
As a result of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou have suggested that pangolins are long-lived mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine are potential intermediate masters of SARS-COV-2; this is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the crown of the pangolanis and the SARS-COV-2.
However, the difference of 1% distributed between both genomes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-COV-2 are still largely unknown.
Under laboratory conditions, SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive for 48 hours in dry environments and for up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and 40 to 50 per cent humidity.
SARS-COV-2 can have similar properties.
SARS-COV-2 is known to feel ultraviolet and heated to 56 °C for 30 minutes; it can effectively block the activity of the virus, 75 per cent lead alcohol, chlorinated disinfectants, peroxylic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexide.
The human population as a whole does not have immunity from SARS-COV-2, so people are vulnerable to the new virus.
There is currently no data available on detailed studies of the Immunity Responses to SARS-COV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronators, especially the SARS-Cov and the MERS-Cov (figure 4).
Usually, the virus's owner first recognizes the inherent immune system through image-based receptors (ORRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIS-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus promotes inflammation exposure, dendrite cell maturity and type I interferon synthesis, which deters the spread of the virus and accelerates the phagocytes of macrophages with regard to viral antigens.
However, thanks to the SARS-Cov N protein, there may be no immune response.
An adaptive immune response is soon included in the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T-cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T-cells directly kill infected cells.
helper T cells produce fire-extinguishing cytocines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T-cell functions by causing their programmed death.
Moral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against virus infection.
For example, antibodies from a healthy patient have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperresponsibility of the immune system entails a large number of free radicals, which may cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, result in polyorganic deficiency and even death.
The SARS-COV-2 infection, characterized by cluster manifestations, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who are in violation of the immune system.
According to a survey of the first 425 cases of infection in Uhan, the estimated average incubation period is between 1 and 14 days, mostly from 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases revealed that the incubation period averaged 3 days, with a range of 0 to 24 days.
More recently, the study described above, based on the demographic data of 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2 days).
It is very important for the health authorities to adjust the time limits of the quarantine measures introduced to the most accurate estimates of the length of the incubation period, thereby preventing the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease without symphony.
A common practice was a 14-day quarantine for persons who had contact with the virus or who had been infected with the virus.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptoms of COVID-19 are often high temperatures, which can be the only manifestation, or are accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficult breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, slurpour, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
A week after the outbreak of the disease, some patients had a condition called footwear and (or) hypopsy.
In serious cases, the disease has progressed rapidly, and patients have developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulation.
Patients with high temperatures and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even if there is no pathology on the chest.
A demographic study carried out at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptoms: 98 per cent at high temperatures, 76 per cent at dry cough, 55 per cent at rest, and 3 per cent at diarrhoea; 8 per cent required artificial ventilation of lungs.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of cases of domestic infection and transmission of the virus from unsymptopic infections.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-COV, whose main symptoms were also high temperatures (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and footwear (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of these required artificial ventilation of the lungs, which is much higher than for patients with COVID-19 and corresponds to a higher death rate from MERS than for COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperatures (99 - 100 per cent), dry cough (29 - 75 per cent), footwear (40 - 42 per cent), diarrhea (20 - 25 per cent) and throat pain (13 - 25 per cent), and artificial ventilation of the lungs required 14 - 20 per cent.
As of 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this, the death rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10 per cent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study carried out in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
As a result of an earlier study, the base value of reproduction (R0) for SARS-COV-2 was determined at 6.47 per cent of the confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-COV was only 2 to 4.
The sARS-COV-2 comparison with MERS-COV and SARA-COV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in table 1.1.
The above indicators show a higher sARS-Cov-2 Proliferation capacity than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but death rates in the event of infection with a new virus are lower than in the latter two.
Thus, it will be far more difficult to contain the SARS-COV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-COV epidemics.
The class phenomenon often occurs when infected within a single family or group of people gathered together for any reason or put together on a vehicle, e.g. on a cruise line.
Patients often traveled to Uhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contacts with people infected or sick during the last two weeks prior to the outbreak of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have been treated can again become carriers of the virus after being released from the hospital, which is a warning signal for the extension of quarantine.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the field blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 have had LFL < 4x109/L, including < 1x109/L white cells, as well as increased aparagus/aminotransferase and virus levels.
Some patients found elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in their blood, while most patients observed higher levels of C-reactive protein and blood red blood cells.
The level of D-dimer, fibrin decay in the blood has been increased and lymphocytes have decreased steadily.
Most patients with COVID-19 found pathologies with uneven eclipses on both sides or blackouts by type of “motor glass” in the lungs in the X-ray study.
Patients often develop a priori pneumonia, severe lung damage and acute respiratory disease (PRD).
In the development of ODS, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis result in a significant flow of gas.
The function of type I and II pneumatic cells reduces surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of lungs to expand and increase the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray research are often the same as the worst cases.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the decomposition of pneumatic cells, the formation of gyalin membranes and intercrete lymphatic inflation, and the multi-nuclear synthic cells in lung patients who died of the disease correspond to the pathology of virus infection and OHD and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The method of detection of the SARS-COV-2 RNA was used as the main criterion in the diagnosis of COVID-19 through a polymerosed chain reaction with a reverse transcryptase (RPC with reverse transcryptase).
However, given the high level of false outcomes that can accelerate the epidemic, as of 13 February 2020 China began to make diagnosis on the basis of clinical evidence (no longer relying solely on the reverse transcrytase PCR).
A similar situation was the case with the ATS diagnosis.
Therefore, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine data from the history of disease, clinical events, laboratory tests and X-ray research.
On 14 February 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the protocol for the application of the SHERLOCK methodology, based on the CRISPR repetitive, for the detection of SARS-COV-2; this method allows the detection of synthetic fragments of the SARS-COV-2 RNA at a density of between 20 × 10 - 18 mol/l up to 200 × 10 - 18 mol/l (10 - 100 copies per microlitre of the reference sample) using detectors for less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new method, if tested successfully on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity and comfort of the tests.
Because of the lack of experience in countering a previously unknown coroner's coroner, doctors can mainly provide patients with COVID-19 only with support therapy, while at the same time attempting to use any therapeutic methods that were used or proposed for other coronavirus treatments, such as SAS-COV and MERS-COV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include the current or potential use of anti-virus drugs, immunity-destroyors, steroids, the plasma of patients who have recovered, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even the plasma of healthy patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
During the early stages of the SARS-COV-2, it is mainly light, and it may be less striking to other ACE2-expressing organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, the disruption of work and the refusal of breathing organs are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, support for the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, are critical to ease symptoms and save lives.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extra-corporal membrane oxidization (ECMO), a modified extra-pollumonal circulatory technique used to treat life- threatening heart or respiratory insufficiency.
In addition, maintaining the wet-sal balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock and protecting vital functions are essential for patients with SAS-COV-2.
Cytokin storm is known to have resulted from the hyperretroactivity of the immune system of patients infected with the SARS and MERS viruses.
The cytocin storm is a form of a system-wide inflammatory process that responds to a series of cytamines, including TNF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, INN, INN, IFN, IFN and MCP-1.
These cytocines provoke immunocyclets to release large amounts of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of ODS and polyorganic deficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine storms, particularly those in severe condition, the suppression of immunity is crucial.
Corticosteroids and tocilysmubs, monocolonal antibodies, serving as interleucine-6 inhibitor, were used to treat cytokine storms.
Other methods of treating cytokine storm based on the suppression of immunity include a simulation of immune response to T-cell control; an embargo on the production of INN, IL-1 and TNF cytoxins; the suppression of nynius-kinas; the use of blintomaba, cytokin-point compressors 4 and hystondeacelase inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes, the use of steroids in the treatment of SARS viruses is widespread.
However, steroids in large doses do not benefit from the treatment of severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonocrosis, which significantly deteriorate the forecast.
However, short corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended for application with caution in patients ' treatment with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective anti-virus therapy.
However, the intravenous introduction of a nucleotid analog remedesir proved to be an effective treatment for a U.S. patient with COVID-19.
The remedessir is a recently developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilad to treat Ebola and Marburg virus diseases.
Later, the remedessir also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other single-device RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, Gilad provided this drug composition to China for steam studies on patients infected with SARS-COV-2 and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baritinib, ?-interferon, thoperinaur/rivaviar and fisher were suggested as treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
A combined treatment with the use of a log-in/riot-in-law may be accompanied by diarrhea, fattyness, vomiting, liver failure and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs assigned to patients should be followed with caution.
Plasma of well-treated patients and the development of antibodies
Blood transfusions from patients who have been cured of an communicable disease have long been used to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect a healthy population.
In fact, the blood of patients who have recovered often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to fight pathogens.
The antibodies are found in the immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to control pathogens and other non-natural objects; they recognize and target individual pathogens and neutralize them.
Based on this assumption, plasma was derived from blood samples from a group of patients who had been cured of COVID-19, which was then introduced into 10 severely ill patients.
During the 24 - hour period, their symptoms improved, inflammation rate and virus load decreased, and blood Saturation increased.
However, in order to propose mass use of this method prior to specific treatments, there is a need for an untested and unexplained explanation.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some problems related to plasma use should be examined carefully.
For example, antibodies can over-incentivize the immune system and cause cytoxins syndrome, which, given their toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
Antibody concentration in the blood is usually low, and plasma is required to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to identify the B cells of healthy patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or to perform screenings to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can move immediately to the mass production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on a combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which varies according to the diagnosis of a disease based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to identify and test these components or their optimal combination.
At present, due to the lack of effective specialized treatment for COVID-19, traditional medicine in China has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild and moderate symptoms or for patients who recover from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Lian Hua Qing Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen) capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
A number of provinces in China where 87 per cent of patients were treated in traditional Chinese medicine, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ninxia (50 per cent) and Hunanh (50 per cent), while China ' s traditional medicine, where only approximately 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 were treated, recorded the lowest percentage (13 per cent).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison, as the assessment should take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Bolly Zhang (Boly Zhang) and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment only in Western medicine and combined treatment in Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the normalization of body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and the provision of medical care in the hospital were significantly lower for patients whose treatment was combined with Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who were treated only in Western medicine.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients whose symptoms began to deteriorate (from slight to severe) was markedly lower in the group treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in a group treated only in Western medicine (7.4% compared with 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared with 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficiency and security of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully monitored studies, conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest to receive, where possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness of or a combination of components used in traditional Chinese medicine.
Patients suspected of or confirmed the existence of COVID-19 are largely afraid of acute and even fatal disease, and those who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as sleeplessness from corticosteroids, can cause further anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of an outbreak caused by the SARS virus, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotorism, psychotic symptoms, destitution and even suicide.
The mandatory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, which are among the measures taken by the health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can contribute to the anxiety and guilt of people with regard to the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
Psychiatric and psychiatric care should therefore be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons suspected of or in contact with them, as well as to all other people who require it.
Psychological support should provide multi-purpose mental health teams, provide clear and accurate information on the SARS-COV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission chain from animal vectors and infected people to vulnerable owners and are often used to complement the antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines aimed at developing long-lived and highly effective neutral antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-COV.
In animal studies, live, weakened vaccines from SARS viruses have been developed.
However, prior to clinical research, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when applied to older patients, the death-dose infection model and the degree of protection against the infection of zonozo-viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago and since then no new case has been reported.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of disease caused by the MERS virus continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions as a result of the conservation of zonal sources in the habitats of endemics.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using the activated virus, DNA plasmoid, virus vectors, nanoparticles, particulates and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been assessed on animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-COV-2 vaccine for those without immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to long-term (an average of 18 months) necessary for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic modification of the coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to reveal a full picture of the clinical current of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases patients are gradually cured without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe illness.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease in order to prioritize their measures, particularly in areas where there is a lack of resources.
Based on current clinical studies, the following factors may affect the forecast of or be associated with patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the current of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which also corresponds to the truth in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly targets patients aged 30 to 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to have initial diseases and complications and were much older than those who did not need such treatment (on average 66 years, compared with 51 years), which suggests that age is a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: the infection of SARS-COV-2 among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute damage to myocardium and arithmia.
Cardiological phenomena were also the main cause of death in the SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-COV-2 could also be associated with ACE2 positive cholesterol cells, which could cause liver disorders with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely intertwined and can distort results.
The deviations identified in laboratory research: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage and is proposed as a potential predictive factor for the current of the disease, the response to therapy and the final recovery.
It was also suggested that consideration should be given to the relationship between C-reactive protein level, the severity of the disease and the projections at COVID-19.
In addition, increased lactate hydride, aparagine amino-transferases, alanine amino-transferases and cryatinases can also predict results.
These enzymes are produced in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally signs of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: In order to predict results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, account should be taken, along with other factors, of the X-ray study of the chest and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
The use of steroids: As described above, steroids are those that are commonly used in infectious diseases as additional treatments to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids have been widely used to treat patients with severe forms of ATS, many survivors have developed avascular osteonocrosis, which has resulted in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients are suffering from unforeseen stress because they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the deaths of relatives and other patients.
In order to relieve the stress of such patients and help them return to normal life, psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to reproducing in the lower respiratory pathways, the SAS-COV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common cold diseases, can reproduce successfully in the upper respiratory pathways and cause weak symptoms or do not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients whose early stages of the disease or their incubation period have not yet ended may spread the virus on a large scale in their normal lives, making epidemiological control very difficult.
However, it was thought that the transmission of the SARS-COV virus occurs when patients are seriously ill, and that most cases did not occur at an early stage of infection.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it's harder to control it.
A great deal of work is currently under way in China, which has declared universal quarantine in Uhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the extension of the quarantine regime for virtually the entire population, which has been introduced to break the distribution chain of the SARS-COV-2 virus.
While these measures have caused great harm to the economy and other spheres of life in the country, the number of new patients identified has been declining, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March, and the phase of silence will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Gunter) and his colleagues estimated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which appeared to be much more contagious than the SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group headed by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) formed a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-COV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-COV-2 virus had been detected in nose and throat strokes taken from patients who had been cured and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclic disease similar to the flu.
However, the decrease in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, pointing out that the strategies currently in place may have had an impact.
The initial forecast was that Ebola's fever would affect up to a million people and cause half a million patients to die.
But with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually came under control.
It is likely that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the inflammability of the SARS-COV-2 virus can weaken and will eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus with a human being.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS (Figure 55).
The SARS-COV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transfer through cough or sneeze, and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been detected in potassium, which means that oral-fecular transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 cases examined may have been the result of a hospital infection, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Therefore, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders, patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the person; both surgical masks and respirators of Class N95 (Series No. 1860s) help to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent microclosures from spreading into the air and from settling on the surfaces from which they can be passed on to others.
However, only masks of Class N95 (Series No. 1860s) can protect against inhaling between 10 and 80 nms; only 5% of rovers; the SARS-COV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-COV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can even penetrate five surgical masks together, medical personnel who are in direct contact with patients must wear class N95 masks (series No. 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health workers should wear a protective robe to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
The viruses can also get into the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-COV-2 even though he wore a Class N95 mask; perhaps he was infected with the virus through his eyes inflamed.
Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent head shields or closed-type protective points.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more frequently by disinfecting detergents, to try not to leave home in isolation, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of about three feet is considered acceptable to the patient.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-COV-2 virus had previously not been known to mankind, the high degree of its similarity to Sirs-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, was to be a warning signal for China, taking into account the experience it had acquired during the outbreak of the SARS in 2003.
However, it was only after 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Disease Control Centre in Uhan calmed citizens, informing them that the new virus had a low rate and limited reproductiveity in human-to-human transmission and that prevention and control of disease would not be a problem.
This statement greatly reduced social tensions, particularly at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Chinese New Year celebration, and a critical time was lost when the disease could be held within Uhana with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as each word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information from clinics than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain the potential epidemic at the early stages of its development than to discourage the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to regularly verify and improve the public response system.
The COVID-19 flash caused by the previously unexplored coroner of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease had spread throughout China and had spread to 50 countries around the world at the time of writing.
Since the virus is very similar to the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV) and COVID-19 symptoms are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 gave rise to a sense of recidivism of the SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are relevant in terms of controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 hits older persons more than young people and men than women; the incidence of serious accidents and mortality among older persons is also higher than among young people.
The mortality rate as a result of ATS is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
The patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is not symphony, whereas the SARS patients tend to infect the environment only in severe cases, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than the SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-COV-2 is spreading much faster and larger than SARS-COV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal tests for the existence of the SARS-COV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, patients who have been treated can again show positive tests of the virus.
All of this greatly increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
Against the backdrop of such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some of the critical issues remain pending, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-COV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 per cent homologist between SARS-COV-2 and two SARS-like coroner-like mice, we still cannot claim that the infection of SARS-COV-2 was from flying mice.
What animal became an intermediate species that passed the virus from the original owner, such as the flying mice, to the human?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot effectively interrupt the transmission, and the epidemiological situation can deteriorate at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-COV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how exactly is it that the virus is being introduced into airway cells and trigger subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause the world’s pandemic, disappear as well as SARS, or reciprocate from time to time like flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
But we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normalcy.
Zoone-based origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their carriers, including people, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coroners (HCOV) were causing a slight disease such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus can be.
The emergence of a major respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 once again drew attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with a high transmission but less pronounced pathogen of the virus than the related SAS-CoV virus.
Man's coronary infection is zonosis, and understanding its zonal origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from flying mice for which they are not pathogens.
Also known are intermediate reservoirs carrying certain human coronators.
The definition of animal carriers has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of coronavirus animals can also shed light on the pathogens of the coronary.
In this review, we present available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zonal origin and inter-species transmission.
It is important to note that we compare and compare different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, today ' s epidemic of coronaviruses discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is also under consideration.
In addition, the conditions necessary for the successful change of carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease flow are noted.
Coronavimunes belong to the Coronavime family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive polar branch of RNA.
These viruses, with the largest RNA virus-containing genome containing between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides, have been named because of their form, which, when considered under electronic microscope, resembles the crown.
In terms of structure, coroner viruses contain non-segmentated genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open partially closed reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are transmitted to replica polyproteins pp1a and pp1b.
These polyproteins are then reprocessed to produce 16 unstructured proteins, indicated by nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains open readerships for structured proteins, including schispheric protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of line specific acessor proteins have also been coded in other coronary lines.
On the basis of differences in the sequence of protein\ coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha, beta-, gamma- and dactacroninaurus), with the species comprising most of the human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and Bactacroninaurus is volatile mice and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and deltakornaurs.
For thousands of years coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecies barriers, and some have evolved to human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses have been known.
These include human alpha- likes HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63.
The remaining five BDEs include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, SARS-COV, the Middle East Respiratory Coravirus (MERS-COV) and the SARS-COV-2 coroner.
Human coronerships of HCOV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually produce light-shaped symptoms such as cold and (or) diarrhea.
In contrast, the SARS-COV viruses, MERS-COV and the recently discovered SARS-COV-2 are causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively higher number of patients with a higher risk of acute respiratory disease (ORZ) and the presence of non-manageable symptoms.
The first thread of the human coroner HCOV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of patients with colds from a rhino.
Since then, extensive research has resulted in more detailed knowledge of HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that the human coronavirus was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people had died and the total mortality rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic on the Arabian peninsula, with the disease spreading periodically to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus discovered in 2019 (2019-nCov), later renamed Sirs-Cov-2, is the cause of the current epidemic of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), which by 3 March 2020 had more than 3,120 lives and the number of infections had exceeded 91,000.
A warning signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronators have zoonic origins, their sources being volatile mice, mice or domestic animals.
Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of all human coronaviruses from flying mice to which viruses are well adapted and in which pathogenic characteristics are not manifest, but show wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has left China and the world with a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
A study of the zonal mechanism of the origin of human coronators will help to understand their natural history, their forces of evolution and their constraints on inter-species transport.
It may also prompt or accelerate the search for the SARS-COV-2 medium, which is essential to prevent the resurgence of the disease in the future.
The review provides general information on zonal origin, inter-species transmission and pathogens of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we refer to and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses occurred, usually not pathogens for their reservoirs, but become pathogenic after inter-species transmission to the new carrier.
We are also analysing the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by reduced pathogens.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-COV-2 outbreak is also being considered.
Animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the strain of the HCOV-229E virus was first derived from a sample of cold patients separated from the rhino, various coronaviruses were found from various infected animals, including turkey, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
Table 1 provides an informative and vivid account of the discovery of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCV-229E virus was derived from samples taken from the respiratory pathways of patients with infectious failure of the upper respiratory tracts in 1966; the virus was subsequently adapted to the reproduction of the WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with the HCV-229E virus had cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezes, general illness and throat pain, while high temperatures and coughs were observed between 10 and 20 per cent.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was released from the organic culture and the subsequent serial access to the brain of the succulent mice.
The clinical signs of HCOV-OC43 infection look similar to those of the HCV-229E virus, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens such as flu virus A and riniviruses.
Both the HCOV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus are worldwide and are generally transmitted in winter at moderate latitudes.
The period of the two viruses is mainly less than a week and is followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to a volunteer study, healthy people living with HCV-229E developed a common cold of light shape.
Only a few patients with reduced immunity had severe lower respiratory infections.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the A priori pneumonia epidemic, was the first in history to be the well documented pandemic caused by human coroner, and the disease was caused by the SAS-CoV virus, the third of the human coroner viruses detected.
The first SARS case was detected in the Chinese province of Guandun at the end of 2002.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread in many countries and continents.
In the absence of superactive spreading agents, it was estimated that each patient could become infected with approximately two more persons; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days and the peak of the virus load was 10 days.
Patients infected with ATS-COV had initial muscle pain, headaches, high temperatures, general illness and burn, and late symptoms included clothes, coughs and respiratory problems.
The laboratory deviations from the SARS standard are lymphobias, liver problems and elevated levels of cryptics.
The SARS patients also experience diffuse alveolar damage, valorization of epithelial cells and macrophage rise.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients are subsequently in need of intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such difficult cases,\ in addition to the lower respiratory pathways, other organs may be infected, including gastrointestinal tracts, livers and kidneys, usually accompanied by cytocinin storms, which may prove fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
For the first time, the virus was identified from the open biopsy of a relative of the patient who had come to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been devoted to the study of human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCOV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found that it was mainly affecting young children, older persons and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory problems.
The disease caused by HCOV-NL63 is characterized by such manifestations as slurp, conditions, high temperature and bronchiolite.
Another independent study describes the release of the same virus from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was detected in the Netherlands, but is actually widespread.
HCOV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, while the peaks of diseases caused by them occur at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is linked to an offensive laringitis, which is also called a grain.
HCOV-HKU1 was allocated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to non-pharmaceutical pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 is linked to an increase in Asthmatic diseases.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43, the HCOV-HKU1 virus, which causes respiratory diseases of light form, has been detected around the world.
All of these four coroneria that cause non-participating infections were well adapted to people, and their mutation with high-patogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although incidents and their causes are unknown, as in a rare example with a more virulent HCV-NL63 subtype, which, according to recent reports, has caused serious lower respiratory infections in China.
Usually, the acquired ability to transmit and preserve effectively in the body of a human being, these human coronaviruses become less violet or pathogens.
The crown of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia as a light, 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal insufficiency.
Most laboratoryly confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, import and distribution cases have been reported through accidental secondary infections with close contact.
Another secondary outbreak, with 186 confirmed cases, occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical effects of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) remind us of the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), both of which are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal deficiencies, which still differentiates MERS from other diseases caused by coronaviruses transmitted to human beings.
More than 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratoryly confirmed cases of high mortality respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (34.4 per cent) were recorded, and MERS-Cov was therefore considered one of the most lethal viruses known to man.
From mid-20 to the end of December 2019, the Hubei Province of China identified clusters of patients with pneumonia, which are now linked, looking back, to the infection caused by the coronavirus of severe respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the continued outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-COV-2 is a global public health emergency and the disease itself has been referred to as “Coronar infection 19” (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide, with deaths of approximately 3.4 per cent.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in Hubei Province of China is 4.2 per cent and outside the province 1.2 per cent.
SARS-COV-2, like the SARS and MERS coroner, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by a rise in temperature, cough and rest.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become respiratory deficiency syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2, given the high homologism of nucleotide sequences (82 per cent), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of phyloginethic wood.
CARS-COV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater transfer capacity than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 has been reported to show the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-COV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, the coronaviruses transmitted to a person have a similar incubation period and the duration of the current of the disease they cause.
In this regard, SARS-COV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, in terms of the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19, it is between SAS-COV and four human coroner viruses that cause non-particular infections (i.e., HCOV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, the incidences of ATS-COV-2 are similar to those found most frequently in human coronaviruses that cause non-medical infections, including non-specific infections, light symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-COV infection, a small sub-group of COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, in terms of the transmission of ATS-COV-2, there are also interesting patterns that characterize both the human coronaviruses that cause non-particular infections and the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-COV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses causing non-particular infections.
On the other hand, it is yet to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-COV-2 is being reduced with each subsequent transition of the virus (i.e. the infection of each of the following persons), as in the case of the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses causing non-particulate infections, the SARS-COV-2 can be detected in the samples of kala.
We have yet to answer the question as to whether the fair and oral channel of the SARS-COV-2 is as significant (at least under certain circumstances) as in the case of the SARS-COV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of the SARS-COV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause non-particular infections.
Nevertheless, the future development of the continued COVID-19 will depend on the characteristics of the SARS-COV-2, including transmission, panic and sustainable spread after human transition.
All four human coroneracies that cause non-particular infections with mild symptoms were well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, it may be people who have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be described as the only survivors after the pandemic of human coronaviruses in the past.
Human coronaviruses, which cause severe diseases in humans, and people who cause severe diseases in humans, have simply not survived.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses must be reproducing in the human body sufficiently to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the limitations of the carrier.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-COV-2 flash occurs and the more people are infected, the more likely it is that the virus is fully adapted to the human being.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult for people to stop it by quarantine or other communicable disease control measures.
For many years, four extracurricular coronary coronarys, which are common to people with healthy immunity, have been circulating among the population.
These viruses are not required by the reservoir animal.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV have not adapted to the human being well enough and their transmission cannot be supported.
They need to maintain and reproduce in their zonal tanks and to look for cases of vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying bearers.
SARS-COV-2 has features similar to SAS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCV non-particular viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as non-particular HCOV, at least for the present time.
But it's more pathogen than non-particular HCV, and less pathogen than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts fully to the human being and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a container or with an intermediate carrier animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of the HCOV viruses, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and shelled HCOV viruses.
The animal is an evolutionary carrier of HCOV if it is carrying a close-born ancestor with the same high homologies at the order of nucleotides.
A long-term virus is usually well adapted and non-patogenic in this wearer.
Similarly, the reservour carries HCV over a long period of time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCV was only stuck in an intermediate medium just before or about the time it was laid down by a human being, it was not well adapted to a new carrier and often pathogen.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonic source of human infection and play a role as an amplifying carrier, allowing the virus to resurpass and then hand it over to the people, increasing the spread of human infection.
HCOV can overcome the impasse if it cannot withstand the transmission within the intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCOV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data have retrospectively shown that the no-one SARS patient had contact with hunting animals (destroyal animals) in the annals.
Further studies of the pre-eminence of animals have shown that animal traffickers have an IgG virus prevalence rate higher than the population as a whole of the IgG virus.
The Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and the vento-like dog in living animal markets became the first established carriers of viruses, similar to and almost identical to the SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all the fait accomplis in the markets, there was no further reporting of the SARS cases.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan cives, living in nature or on farms and not entering markets, in most cases, had not been defined, which led to the conclusion that the Himalayan cives could serve only as an intermediate booster rather than a natural SARS-COV tank.
Notably, since 80 per cent of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-Cov, it cannot be excluded from the possibility that multiple small mammals can be used as intermediate boosters.
They all appear to be the dead end holders of the SARS-CoV virus.
Following the search for the natural SARS-COV animal, a closely related CoV flying mice was identified, which was referred to as the coroner-related crownavirus of HKU3 flying mice (SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3) and which was present in Chinese submarine-powered flying mice.
These mice are positive on the SARS-COV antibodies and the hormonal sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses of bats have 88-92% of the same homologies of nucleotides sequence as SARS-COV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that flying mice have become carriers of new human pathogens.
The flying mice have also detected several SARS-like coronators (SL-Cov), but none of them can be isolated as a living virus except one that marks WIV1.
It is known that the receptor SARS-COV is a human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1 from the feces of flying mice uses ACE2 flying mice, cyvets and human beings as receptors for entry into the cell.
It's interesting that the serums of sterilizing patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest natural ancestor of Sars-CoV in flying mice, dividing 95% of the homologies of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, WIV1 is generally considered not to be a direct parent of the SARS-CoV virus and the flying mice are not an immediate SARS-CoV container.
The phylogenic analysis classifies MERS-COV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 flying mice and CoV-HKU5 flying mice.
CoV-HKU4 flying mice and MERS-COV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyl-diptide-4 (DPP4) to penetrate viruses.
The sequence of the MERS-CoV MERS virus RNAs is phylognetically closer to the sequence of flexing mice found in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild flying mice have not found a live MERS-CoV virus.
The homology of the MERS-CoV sequence and his immediate relative CoV-HKU25 of flying mice coincided with only 87 per cent.
That is, flying mice might not have been directly a container carrying the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single camels are sero-positive to neutral antitels specific to MERS-COV, as well as camels of Middle East origin in many African countries.
A live MERS-CoV virus that is identical to that found in humans was identified from the nasal masks of single camels, which further confirms the role of camels as true MERS-CoV reservoirs.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-COV have had minor symptoms but a massive virus.
It is noteworthy that the infected camels identified the virus not only by respiratory means but also by fecal ororal means, which is also the main means of identifying the virus with flying mice.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome have not had an anaemone contact with camels before symptoms arise and are likely to be attributed to human transmission or to unknown channels involving unknown species of animals that are MERS-CoV carriers.
The nucleotide homology of the SARS-COV-2 by 96.2% matches the CoV RatG13 flying mice from the Asian submarines of the Rhinophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the difference between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is too large to be attributed to parental relations.
That is, flying mice could not be a direct SARS-COV-2 container unless almost identical coronaviruses of flying mice were found in the future.
It is assumed that the direct animal carriers of the SARS-COV-2 virus must be among the wild species sold and killed in the Ughan bulk market of seafood, which was associated with many initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates a possible transfer from the animal to the animal.
A number of recent studies based on metagen-segregated research have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolinas (Manis javanica) could also carry a parent's betakornaur, a related SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the sequence of nucleotides of these new coronerary genomes is 85-92% the same as the SARS-COV-2.
But they are also closely related to RATG13, with about 90 per cent identity at nucleotide sequence level.
They are classified in two substrates of differentiation of viruses such as SARS-COV-2 in a phylogene tree, one of which has a receptor binding domain (SDD) closer to CARS-COV-2 with amino acid sequences of 97.4 per cent.
Conversely, the SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 strains are more coherent despite a higher degree of homology of sequences throughout the genome.
An earlier study of pangland patients also reported on the identification of virus congeners in lung samples that were similarly related to the SARS-COV-2.
The study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to produce a genome sequence of about 86.3% of a fully fledged virus genome.
The possibility of pangolin becoming one of the intermediate porters of SARS-COV-2 cannot be ruled out.
However, as a result of the division between the SARS-COV-2 sequences and the baroque barbarians of the ARS-CoV-2s, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of the SARS-COV-2 from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is even shorter than between SARS-COV-2 and the Bactacronaurus of the Pangrims associated with SARS-COV-2.
The evolution of the SARS-COV-2 path has not yet been established for flying mice, pangans and other mammals.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in the RSD between SRS-COV-2 and the Bactacroninaurus of the Pangrims related to SARS-COV-2, sARS-COV-2 and RATG13 have the highest homology of sequences throughout the genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between the BTACs of the Panglons related to the SARS-COV-2 and the SARS-COV-2 relate to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The counterproposal is in favour of recombination between the baroque barbarous barbarous SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among the Betakornaurs.
There is still no final decision on the direct zonal origin of SARS-COV-2.
In addition to high-patogenic HCOV viruses, the zoonic origin of the HCov-229E, HCV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Philogenic evidence shows that both HCOV-NL63 and HCV-229E can occur from crown viruses of flying mice, while the parent viruses of HC43 and HCV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
It was reported that the coroner's coroner of flying mice, called ARCOV.2, found in North America's three-colored attachment to HCOV-NL63, showed close relationship.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E is genetically linked to another crown of flying mice called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although it was suspected that its intermediate carrier might have been camels.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
The phylogenic analysis provided evidence of the events of the inter-species transmission of HCOV in anamnesia.
When there was inter-species transmission of the HC-OC43 virus around 1890 and people were infected by domestic animals, the respiratory pandemic was recorded.
The history of the HCOV-229E inter-species is not so clear.
Alpha-Koronaurus of flying mice close to HCV-229E have been detected.
Between them lies the alpha - crown alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from flying mice to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpakas, who could communicate with flying mice in the overall environmental niche.
At the same time, humans are in close contact with the alpacas.
Second, the alpha-Koronaurus of flying mice, related to HCV-229E, have different and non-patogenic mice, while the alpha-connaissor alpaca has caused respiratory disease from infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alpha - crown was not found in wild animals.
Thus, the probability that the alpas received alpha-cronyrus, which is related to HCV-229E, from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, flying mice are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the virus of bloodshed, the Ebola virus, the Nippa virus and the Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that flying mice could directly pass on HCV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while alpha-Koronaurus bats could serve as a dungeon of the HCOV-229E virus, alpakis and unicorn camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to people, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of inter-species transmission from flying mice to single camels and from unicorn camels to a man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from flying mice is known by its original identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is clear that flying mice provide a rich pool of viruses of various types for inter-species exchange of dung and inter-species transmission.
Long-term, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and ability to fly make flying mice “ideal spreading agents”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced by camels a decade ago.
He adapted well to these camels, who from the intermediate bearer became a stable and natural reservoir.
These animals have a very mild disease caused by the MERS-CoV virus and are characterized by relatively low mutations.
His episodic transmission to man is an accident, and the person remains the deadlocker of MERS-COV, since his transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of panguns, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, the BTACs are highly pathogens that have pancreas.
They may also be the dead end holders of SARS-COV-2-related baeronautics, as well as cyvets in the case of SARS-COV.
In future studies, several possibilities for inter-species transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus should be confirmed or excluded from animals.
First, flying mice can be a container for the SARS-COV-2 virus, almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
Humans can divide the environmental niche with the flying mice by carbonic or carnivorous carcasses of these animals.
Secondly, the pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifiers into which the SARS-COV-2 virus has recently arrived.
Humans are infected with the virus through carcasses and the eating of wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are receptive to the SAS-COV-2.
The examination of domestic and wild animals on antibodies is justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of the SARS-COV-2 could take place in a third form, which was in contact with both the flying mice and the pangolins.
The search for animal origin is continuing SARS-COV-2.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, the three main drivers of viruses also helped cross inter-species barriers.
First of all, they're relatively high mutations in reproducing RNAs.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the estimated frequency of coroner mutations mutations mutations can be considered “moderate” with an average replacement frequency of approximately 10-4 replacements per year at one point 2, depending on the adaptation phase of the coroner to new masters.
Coronatures have a correct exorbitant exorobonuclease, the removal of which results in an extremely high frequency of mutationation and weakening or even incapacity.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog Remdécier suppresses the reproducing of coronavirus by inhaling this exorobonuclease and RNA dependent RNA polymerase.
The remedessir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-COV-2 tools to be tested in clinical research.
Nevertheless, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is nearly a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutation can often be even higher if the coronavirus is not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-Cov with high mutation frequency, the frequency of the SARS-Cov-2 mutations appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to people.
This virus is supposed to have been adapted to another carrier close to human beings.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this is also true of MERS-COV, which is well adapted to single camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that vaccines and anti-virus drugs from SARS-COV-2 will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in the coronavirus results in greater plasticity in the genome with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-species coercion, favourable to the emergence of new coronaviruses, subject to conditions.
This is facilitated by the numerous unique open framework and functions of proteins coded in the direction of 3° end of the genome.
Thirdly, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coroner viruses randomly and often switch between matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcrying of the coroner’s DNA in the wearer, which serves as a mixing receptacle, the neem is often switched over.
High-level, full-size and sub-genic RNAs can recombinate and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCOV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, and in coronaviruses such as SL-Cov andatCov-HKU9 flying mice.
Relationship of the virus with regard to transmission
In addition to the three above virus factors, another key factor important for inter-view transmission is the interaction of the virus with the receptor of the carrier.
This article provides a typical example, which also demonstrates positive selection in inter-modal transmission events, by way of a recombination of SARS-CoV.
Based on a comparative analysis between the SARS-Cov human and cyvetum strains, SARS-Cov is considered to be undergoing rapid adaptation in different media, especially with regard to the mutations of S protein on RSD.
In general, RSD protein S coronaviour interacts with the cell receptor and the reaction of the carrier's antibodies is intensively chosen.
SRS-COV is amino acids, from 318th to 510th, in S1 section, which connects to human angiotensor 2 (APF2) and its corceptors to incorporate the virus into the cell.
SARD-CoV is capable of recognizing the receptors of APF2 from different animals, including flying mice, cyvets, mice and ethanol dogs, making it possible to transmit the virus inter-species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in the RCF, which are different from human and cyvet virus strains, of which 4 are in the receptor binding motive for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
The SARS-Cov cives have the mutations K479N and S487T in the RSD, which can increase the coffinity of a schillenium protein with a human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two substitutes for amino acids can be particularly important for adapting the virus to a human being.
It is worth noting that SARS-COV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in S1 protein segment S results in the possible change in the co-ordination of S protein to human APF2.
Indeed, a cryoelectronic microscopic study says that the affinity of this link is 10 to 20 times higher than between APF2 and the SS S virus SARS-COV.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other receptors were required for the transfer of SARS-COV-2.
It is surprising that HCOV-NL63 is also linked to APF2, but another segment of protein S.
There are many other receptors for HCV, such as amino herd N for HCV-229E and 9-O-accetylic acid for HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in people after inter-species transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the inter-species transmission of HCOV is also managed by other dependence and limitation factors of the carrier.
The design of these proteins between humans and natural HCVs reservoirs, such as flying mice, single camels and rodents, may constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
The successful inter-species transmission of HCOV viruses requires that dependency factors be captured and that media resistors are subordinated.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can be achieved through an impartial, full-mandatory screening of port dependence and rescission factors for SARS-COV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
Getting new HCOV: back to zero
The variety of crowns of flying mice creates a wide range of possibilities for new HCOVs.
In this sense, coronaviruses of bats serve as a genetic pool for HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also a driving force for the evolution of HCOV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coded genes has the potential to radically modify phenotype viruses.
Among SARS-COV acetastic proteins is deemed to be important for human adaptation, because the flying mice viruses, the SARS-Cov related, were isolated, but it was found that they coded ORF8 Dirgen proteins.
In the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide act, which is characteristic of the SARS-CoV coroner, was found.
This case splits the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to be an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change in the media.
In addition, SARS-COV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-macro-invasion lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in the RNC-dependent polymerasis.
Localization of recombination was also defined in non-structured proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV had been subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which had occurred in single camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, recombinant events were also observed in other HCVs where HCV was recombined with other animal coronaviruses in its non-structured genes.
It should also be warned that man-made selection can contribute to unintentional changes in virus genomes, which is likely to result from the release of the virus from breeding pressures, such as from the carrier ' s immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-size ORF4 in a prototype HCOV-229E strain through a bi-nucleotid exercise.
While an intact open read-out box of ORF4 can be seen in the flying mouse and camel viruses associated with HCV-229E, the alpha-connaissance of the alpaca shows a one-nicleotide box, resulting in a shift of the framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCOVs is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoirs.
When flying mice were infected with coronaviruses, weak symptoms or lack of them were recorded, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and flying mice.
It turns out that flying mice are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the retardant response by flying mice effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in flying mice has been suppressed by the inflammatory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low degree of exposure of molecules of Class I main histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen, which is ensured by the high metabolic activity of flying mice, can suppress the reproducing of the coroner while affecting the reading of exorobonuclease, thus creating a selection pressure to generate strains of the virus that are highly pathogened when entering the new carrier.
More pathogenic strains of the coroner may also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is no coincidence that over the past 20 years three new coronaviours of man have appeared.
Crown vessels are not pathogens or cause light symptoms in their reservoirs, such as flying mice or camels.
They're rehearsing with confidence without causing a strong immune response from the carrier.
This is the secret of why we see unsymptopic carriers and what causes serious human infections.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hypertension of the immune response and the cytokin storm, with the stronger immune response, the greater the impact of the lung.
On the contrary, unsymptomized bearers do not have an immune response that does not involve reproducing the coroner.
The same non-imunerative response strategy can have positive effects in treatment against SARS-COV-2.
Flying mice have a particularly powerful interferonal response.
Thus, the admission of type I interferno, at least in the initial phase of the SARS-COV-2 infection, should have a positive effect on people.
In addition, NLRP3-inflammmas activation has been disrupted by flying mice.
On this basis, inhalation of NLRP3-inflammma with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 follows a general pattern that emerged from SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
While flying mice have been found to have a nucleotide homologia of 95% coincident with Sirs-CoV, there is also a coroner of flying mice whose nucleotide homologie is 96% the same as SARS-COV-2.
Although civets and other animals in the market were found to be carrying viruses identical to SARS-Cov, there were no directly intermediate media for SARS-COV-2.
The pangolin bactacronoids were detected, the amazing homologic SARS-COV-2, which indicates that pangolins could have served as an intermediate carrier or that fragments of the gene of the Bactacroninaurus may have entered the final version of the SARS-COV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by man.
The Crown has received universal attention because of the recent outbreak of Sirs-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zonal origin and HCV reserve animals in human transmission.
The convincing evidence has shown that SARS-Cov, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are from flying mice and have been handed over to man through intermediate bearers.
If SARS-COV infection is caused by contact between people and cybetics in markets, the closure of the wildlife markets and their destruction could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of a wide range of BTAC lines of panglorics close to SARS-COV-2, the Angolaans should be removed to prevent zonal transmission of infection from food markets.
However, whether SARS-COV-2 is passed on to people through pan-Malunians and other mammals and how this can be done remains the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus had long existed with unicorn camels.
These camels are an important vehicle and also a main source of meat, milk, skin and wool for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as has been done in China's wildlife markets, to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2.
A comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-COV for camels in conjunction with other communicable control measures in order to stop the periodic outbreaks of MERS.
Since we cannot address these viruses, new genetics that cause outbreaks of disease may appear.
A wide variety of zootic coronaviruses circulate around the world.
In particular, there is an extremely wide range of crowns of flying mice with zonal potential.
There is a great deal of potential for the evolution and recombination of these zonal coronators, which in the future will lead to new coronaviruses, which are more easily transmitted and (or) more deadly for man.
To reduce human-animal contact, a culture of wildlife consumption in some parts of China must be abandoned.
Following the severe tests of the SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plan are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural tanks until it becomes possible to seize new territories.
While many properties of flying mice are conducive to the spread of viruses, training people to keep away from them can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
A better understanding of the environment of coronaviruses and their natural carriers requires continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing the transfer of coroner viruses from animals to man and future outbreaks of disease.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent zonoza virus is to keep people away from the environmental web of natural tanks of zonostic viruses.
There are still some fragments missing in the puzzle of the zonal origin of SARS-COV-2.
First, if flying mice have passed on the SARS-COV-2 ancestral virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances volatile mice and pangolins share the same environmental niche.
Secondly, if flying mice play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with flying mice.
Thirdly, if the role of a true intermediate carrier is played by a third mammals, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including human beings, flying mice and panglons.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be sensitive to the SARS-COV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a flying mouse, pangolin or other mammals, it is expected that in the future the SARS-COV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified from their natural carriers.
Further research in this field will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-COV-2 in animals, which will have important consequences for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for “cases of suspicion” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 should be updated.
On 6 February 2020, our group published a short reference manual on the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection (2019-nCov), which provides information on our experience and provides verified recommendations to combat the pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; therefore diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for “cases of suspicion” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendations on diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19” (seventh version), issued by the National Health Committee of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In December 2019, a new coronaviar was born in December 2019 (2019-nCov), now officially known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus itself was referred to as “a severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the infection, SARS-COV-2 has developed a short manual and published it on the website of the Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
The publication received great attention.
We note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven issues of the Recommendation on diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 were published by the National Health Committee of the CNR (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), and some of its provisions changed significantly.
Recently, Zhou (Zhou) and the co-sponsors commented on our recommendations, containing simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on this pandemic, which has spread throughout the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the Recommendations on diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 (test seventh version) and on the basis of ongoing studies, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh issue of the document (of 3 March 2020), in order to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the case of suspected disease, one element of the epidemiological history must be combined with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movements or locations in Uhan and its surroundings or other human settlements where there were reported cases of COVID-19 within 14 days of symptoms; (2) history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-COV-2 (positively tested on the basis of nucleinic acids); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhan and its surroundings or other human settlements where there were reported cases of COVID-19 during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (i.e. 2 cases with high temperatures or respiratory symptoms recorded in 2 weeks in small areas, such as home or apartment, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical evidence: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external incidences of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white cells is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on the case of a disease suspected of having one of the following points of pathogens or serologic evidence: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for the SARS-COV-2; (2) the full-benegenic combination of the virus shows a high degree of strength for new coroner; (3) the positive results of the serotest for SARS-COV-2-specific IgM and IgG; or the change in the test result from a positive test for the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, or an increase of at least four times in the recovery phase relative to the acute phase.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of the document added a real-time PCR test for nucleinic acids in respiratory routes or blood samples.
The pathogen diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues; and then in the seventh issue, the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers seeking an optimal set for the detection of nuclein acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as on the analysis of samples taken from respiratory tracts, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the validation criteria.
There is, however, growing evidence of the need for caution in the treatment of patients with a typical symptom and patients with no symptoms.
Thus, the road map presented in Zhou et al. should be updated, as people without clinical symptoms are classified as a “low risk” group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments behind.
With regard to the diagnosis of “cases of suspicion” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in the countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19 - maximum daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 a day.
This is the largest number of deaths from the virus a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that among the reported cases of infection were 114 current cases, as well as 33 healthy patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, reported that four men and one woman had been victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two people died over the age of 60, two between 51 and 60, and one between 41 and 50.
She also reported that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic official informed the local news agency Anadola that one of the deaths was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwaiti hospital in Maytri.
On Saturday, in an online video presentation, the Minister of Road Transport and Bangladesh Bridges, Obeidul Kwader, stated that public transport would be terminated for a longer period than originally planned until the next Saturday.
Public transport was suspended on 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of basic necessities — medicines, fuel, and food — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March for two persons who returned from Italy and for one of them's wives.
As of 19 March, the three people had already recovered.
CARS-COV-2 has crossed a million-dollar line of infections around the world
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection by SARS-COV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 people died from COVID-19 coroner.
Reuben came on the same day that Malawi had the first case of infection confirmed and Zambia had the first case of death from coronaviour.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries where no coronary infections had been reported.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 1000 Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus infections were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths were reported on Wednesday in the United States as a result of coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced an increase in measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the Mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobjan, extended the self-inseparation regime for citizens of the city until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin had stated earlier that the Russians throughout the country, despite their isolation, would be paid their salaries until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of an extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of the vote was 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas earlier curfews lasted only from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce curfews from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that home isolation in the state was extended by order until May 1.
Stores in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian networks of Volworths and Colles stores reduced the number of toilet paper packages that could be purchased at one time at all stores in the country, to two and one, respectively.
On Monday AlDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions were reported in cash announcements, as well as on the Facebook Web page.
Citizens were reportedly starting to make emergency stocks because of the fear that COVID-19 might lead to the introduction of a general self-insulated regime.
On Wednesday, the Volworths network also restricted the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on 4 and 5 March respectively, Volworths and Colles had already restricted this amount to four packages.
The Colles Trade Network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that, with the imposition of a restriction on four packages, “the purchase of toilet paper in many stores is still too fast — one delivery per hour” and called such demand “unprecedented”, while ALDI, as published on Tuesday, referred to this trend as “unanticipated”.
According to the representative of Volworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco's shop in Canberra last week also restricted this amount to two packages.
In order to fill the deficit, Colles started to order larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of supplies, Wolwarts ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made stocks for special early sale on Wednesdays.
Russell Emmerman, executive director of the Australian Reteilers Association, reported that Riteilers were trying to refill stocks, but this was hampered by restrictions on local authorities’ travel schedules.
He looked forward to an increase in the cost of products, as suppliers were trying to meet demand, but less and less favourable offers were available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of the depletion of stocks, some stores could not hold environmental shares.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores were filling up every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky product, so the stock was small, and after the sale of the whole volume of the product, long rows of shelves remained empty, increasing the sense of shortage of stocks.
“Coles and Volworths believe that if the shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet rolls and disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers would probably not panic, ” says Russell Summerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of the reprocessing toilet paper, Who Games a Carp, reported that the stocks had been closed.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent stamps, reported that they were working 24 hours a day to provide sufficient goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when auctions in Melbourne fell due to the absence of buyers for the week of the Labour Day, some real estate vendors had begun to offer free toilet paper to the first auction participants.
The Thursday issue of NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab for cutting and use as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia report of 3 March, first the shops were reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, stating that they did not intend to do so.
Russell Emmerman added that other products also use increased demand, including medical masks, hand - decontamination, haalteria, hand - washing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was observed that the British supermarket's online shop also restricted the sale of Andres' toilet paper by two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of the communicable disease COVID-19 caused by the SARS-COV-2 coroner.
While the term “Pandemia” refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to:
“All countries together are still able to influence the progress of the pandemic”.
This is possible if countries are to detect, test, treat, isolate sick persons, monitor cases and mobilize their citizens,” explained the Director General of WHO, Mr. Ted Aden Guebreísus.
“We are deeply concerned at both the alarming rate of spread and seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is “unforeseen”.
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than the flu has yet been tracked from its inception until continuous global spread”.
Mr. Gebraísus expressed a similar point of view, saying that “we have never seen the pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, WHO declared the disease a public health emergency of international importance and then gave it new status as a pandemic.
Anthony Fauchi, director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said about the outbreak: “It's just the beginning, it's going to get worse.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The coroner's pandemic of 2019-2020 is the current coroner's disease pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a coroner of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The flash was detected in Uhan, China, in December 2019, and an emergency situation of international public health importance was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were cured.
China has a mortality rate of 4 per cent, while the world varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficult breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from first symptoms to peaks usually ranges from about five days, but may also range from two to fourteen days.
At present, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatments are symptoms and supportive; the recommended preventive measures include hand washing, the covering of coughing mouth, respect for distance between people, and the identification and self-inseparation of people suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closures.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, and a widespread lack of goods, exacerbated by panic.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world ' s students.
Disinformation about the virus has begun to spread on the Internet, xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens or people who resemble them, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where there are significant cases of the spread of the virus.
The decrease in travel and the closure of heavy industries has reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the city of Huhan, the capital of the province of Hubei, China, reported that there had been cases of pneumonia with unknown cause, and in early January 2020, an investigation into the situation began.
Infections were mainly related to Juanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have a zono-descendant origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease is known as the SARS-COV-2 virus, which is a recently discovered virus with great similarity to crowns of flying mice, crown viruses of pangolin and SARS-Cov. It was later found that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infection did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the cases registered in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, in the publication of the South China branch of the newspaper Morning Post, which was not verified, it was suggested that the first case of infection had occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei Province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China had declined but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that the number of new infections outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases may be significantly understated, inter alia, because of numerous cases with weakly expressed symptoms.
By 26 February, there were relatively few cases of infection among young people, with patients 19 years of age or younger representing less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide, and Patrick Wallans, chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected before effective group immunity was established.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose test was positive under the official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, official policies had been adopted requiring that only minor symptoms should not be tested.
A study published on 16 March showed that 86 per cent of cases of COVID-19 infection were not detected in China prior to 23 January and that such undocumented patients had become a source of infection for 79 per cent of reported cases.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the figure may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are well - fed.
In other more complex cases, from the beginning of the symptoms to the moment of death, there were between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent period being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were among persons over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of deaths were related to diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include data on deaths of patients with positive results from COVID tests performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not include dead people who have not been tested — for example, in the case of death at home, in homes of the elderly, etc.
The incomplete data for Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official figures for COVID from 4 to 5 times.
The Spokesperson of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: “We know that [the claimed number of deaths is] lower than actual.” His words are confirmed by reports of certain single cases in the United States, which are often due to pandemics such as the H1N1 pig flu epidemic, the first confirmed death was recorded in Uhana on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and outside Asia in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents other than Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods were commonly used to quantify deaths.
All indicators vary according to region and time of disease; they are also affected by testing, the quality of health systems, treatment schemes used, the time taken since the outbreak of the disease and the population parameters, such as age, sex and general health, and the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases of infection within a given time interval is the number of deaths.
As of 10 April 2020, global deaths and infections account for 6.0 per cent (97,039/1 617 204), according to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins.
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality to morbidity ratio has dropped from 17.3 per cent (for those who have symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those who have symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the definition of the percentage of deaths due to disease (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients who die of the disease and the percentage of deaths from infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of patients who die of the disease (both diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
According to estimates by the Oxford University’s Center for Evidence Medicine, the overall rate of death from the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The upper number of this range is consistent with the results of the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany, as well as a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact duration of the flash cannot be defined and may vary according to location.
Macei Boni, a staff member at the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to go out on the plateau and then, when the number of accessible carriers is running out, they begin to fade out.
In the present situation, however, it is virtually impossible to make any reasonable forecast as to when this will occur.”
The Chinese Government's Senior Medical Adviser, Jun Nanchan, claims that “all can end by June” if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucarski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-COV-2 “will circulate perhaps within a year or two”.
According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) is established, physical distance and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, believes: “I don't think that the coronavirus will ever disappear, because it's so easily transmitted” and that it “can turn into a seasonal disease every year”.
The reversibility of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively nonspecific, and some infected people may suffer without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are high temperatures (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetness formation in airways (wheel), loss of obsolescence, rest, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, cold, rudder, hemorrhage, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO claims to be seriously ill with the development of respiratory problems for about 1 in 6 people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) list urgent symptoms such as breathing difficulties, permanent pain or chest fatigue, sudden sense of confusion, difficulty in wake-up and sensuousness of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately; further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, septic disease, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may suffer from unsymptomy without any clinical evidence, but tests confirm infection, and doctors recommend placing patients in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed under strict surveillance and screening for infection.
According to estimates by Chinese scientists, the number of cases of unsymptopic disease ranges from several to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; normally, it is five days.
Some details on how to spread the disease are still unknown.
The disease is deemed mainly to be transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops emitted into the air with cough, sneeze or conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Some studies in open cough can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
It is assumed that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets emitted into the air during a conversation that can remain in the air for longer periods of time; respiratory drops can also be formed during breath, including during conversation, although the virus is not normally transported by air.
Drops can reach the mouth or nose of a number of people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as inflammation and cardiovascular resuscitation (SLR), may lead to the spraying of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.
It may also penetrate the body if a person concerns a contaminated surface, including skin, with subsequent contact with his or her eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also fears that the virus can be transmitted through fecals, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Government of China denies the possibility of ferocular transmission of the SARS-COV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days of the symptoms, although its spread may take place before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.
There were cases where the tests were positive three days before the symptoms, and this suggests that the virus could be transmitted before the symptoms were expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of unsymptopic disease, but research on the monitoring of contacts in some countries has also revealed cases of unsymptopic transmission.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet fully clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient is usually infected by 2-3 other persons, and that the virus is capable of survival on the surfaces from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304), the virus could live for up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day, and on copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature. COVID-19 has been positive for domestic and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as after contacting other surfaces that could be touched by infected people.
The heavy acute respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All of the signs of the new SAS-COV-2 virus are found in nature in related coroner viruses. Without human bodies, the virus can be eradicated by domestic soap, which dissolves its protective shell.
It is assumed to have a zonal origin.
Genetic analysis of the coroner has shown that he is genetically clustered with the kind of Beacocronavirus, the subspecies of Sarabeovirus (Celelet Line B), together with two other strains of flying mice viruses.
At a holistic level, it is 96% identical to other specimens of the coroner's bat (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in the amino acids in certain parts of the sequence of the genomes of the panglon and human viruses.
A solid and man-made comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92 per cent) is between the pangolin coroner and SARS-COV-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangolins are intermediate masters of the virus.
The virus infection may be previously diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this must be confirmed in the final analysis of a polymerosed chain reaction with reverse transcrying (RT-PCR) of an infected secret or computer tomography.
A study comparing CPRs and CTs used in Uhan showed that the CTC is much more sensitive than PCRs, although less specific, because many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease currents.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published the recommendation “not to use the CTC for screening or as a method of testing the first line in the diagnosis of COVID-19”.
WHO has published several RNA test protocols on SARS-COV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Real-time polymethane chain reaction testing (RT-CPD) is under way.
It can be carried out on respiratory samples and on blood samples.
The results are usually produced for a period of between several hours and a few days.
The test is usually carried out with a noscott brush, although a grain brush can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serologic tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been accurate enough to obtain universal approval.
In the United States, a Celex serologic test was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of visualizing symptoms in X-rays and computer-based tomography (CT) are asymmetries of the perimeter type of glass and the absence of plebrasive vents.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for drawing up an international database of confirmed infections.
Because of the similarity with other infections such as the adnovirus, in the identification of COVID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests, have a limited clinical specificity.
A major study was carried out in China to compare the results of the chest and the testing of the PCR, and it was found that although images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be explained more quickly; they are also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be seen as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
In order to diagnose the virus with X-rays and computer-based tomography, spinal networks have been developed based on artificial intelligence.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, coughing or sluffing, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that physical distance be drawn from people; many Governments recommend refraining from any short-term visits to countries and areas affected by outbreaks and limiting the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus was able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread to populations whose members do not know where and how they have been infected; health workers who care for patients who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautions, as well as precautionary measures in contact with others and in the protection of their eyes; and contact monitoring is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring that this type of human surveillance be restricted.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as at 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working to develop solutions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, such as the registration of user proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the user of the mobile phone has been in close contact with the person whose COVID-19 test has been positive, he is notified. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent an infection - for example, a fractured nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or with severe hand-pollution, and before eating, after drying, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to process hands on an alcohol-based basis with at least 60 per cent alcohol content.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated by a number of solutions (the stainless steel surface of the disinfectant starts to function a minute after application) with a contents of 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 - 7.5.5% water peroxide.
Other components, such as benzalconium chlorhexide and glucose, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of suspicion or confirmation of COVID in an institution such as office or day-care facilities, all such spaces, including rooms, toilets, public premises, electronics equipment, such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and batteries used by sick people, be contaminated.
Medical organizations recommend that when coughing or schilling, cover the mouth and nose on the back of the elbow or naphet and immediately throw out the hygiene items used.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to use medical masks because the use of masks can limit the amount and range of breath products scattered in the air during conversation, chat rooms and coughs.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffith, a virologist at Leeds University, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces and the exposure to their faces with dirty hands is the main means of infection.” Masks are also recommended for use by those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, e.g. persons who look after a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using a mask actually reduces the number of contacts to a person.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of public health masks.
CDC centres, U.S.A., recommend the wearing of non-medical weaving masks. China specifically emphasized the importance of using one-time medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 m (3 ft) or less) with others.
It is recommended that Hong Kong wear a medical mask in public transport or public places.
Thai health officials call on people to make front-to-face fabrics in their homes and to wipe them out every day.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the streets without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has committed all visitors to food shops to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks are produced per day since mid-March, medical masks were prescribed for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were obliged to wear a medical mask by going outside; those who could not purchase masks were encouraged to sew them themselves in their home settings.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an anti-communicable measure designed to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding public places, using open-ended greetings and physical distance from others.
Many Governments in the regions, especially those severely affected by the outbreak, now prescribe or recommend social distance.
The maximum number of people who can be gathered in one place, as recommended by U.S. government authorities and health organizations, has been rapidly reduced from 250 people (in regions where there has been no data on the dissemination of COVID-19), to 50 persons and later to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering of older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and weakened immune systems, and faced increased risk of serious infection. The CDC recommends that they remain at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the term “social distance” with “physical distance”, thus clarifying the purpose of this measure by reducing physical contact in social relations, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people must be completely excluded from society, rather than remain in contact with other people by alternative means, some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it was recommended that you should only have sexual relations with your permanent partners with whom you live and in whom you are sure that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
People with COVID-19 diagnosis and those who suspect they are infected are recommended self-inseparation under home conditions.
Health institutions have issued detailed guidelines on proper self-inseparation, and many Governments have also imposed mandatory or recommended that all the population in the affected areas self-possess themselves on quarantine.
People in high-risk groups were ordered to be highly quarantined.
Those who may have been in contact with COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region that is heavily affected by the epidemic have been advised to quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Anti-inflammation strategies include controlling, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage, with the aim of tracking and isolating the infected, as well as other communicable control and vaccination measures aimed at halting the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to control and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be undertaken simultaneously.
The spread of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, reducing the basic number of infections to below 1. Part of the efforts to manage the outbreak of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the leveling of the epidemic.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with the outbreak include personal prevention, such as hand hygiene, use of medical masks and self-inseparation; community measures aimed at physical distance such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning; after the seriousness of the outbreak has become apparent in China, more decisive measures have been taken to curb outbreaks, such as isolation of whole cities and strict travel bans.
Other countries have also adopted a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced, as well as a system for alerting the movements of infected persons.
In Singapore, they provided financial support to self-insulated infected persons and imposed heavy penalties on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks and fines for the accumulation of surplus medicines were increased, and the United Kingdom and United States models showed that serious problems exist with regard to mitigation (a slowdown but not halting the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (a halt to the growth of the epidemic).
An optimal policy of mitigating the effects of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3, while mortality can double but lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapses of health systems.
Pressure may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will be resumed rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has resulted in social and economic costs.
No anti-viral drugs approved for COVID-19 treatment are currently available, but efforts are under way to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
The adoption of non-receptive cold drugs and the drinking of sufficient liquids and rest can help to ease symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous injection of liquid and breathing support.
The use of steroids can only damage.
Several compounds previously approved for other viral diseases are also being considered for use for COVID-19 treatment.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic funds” could ease the symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
WHO views capacity-building and adaptation of health to patients ' needs with COVID-19 as the main response to the outbreak.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (EDRC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to assist in the redeployment of resources at several levels, including concentration of laboratory services for testing at COVID-19, the elimination of non-recurrent procedures where possible, the detection of the virus and the isolation of patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as the expansion of intensive treatment by training staff and increasing the number of available equipments of IWL and others.
There are various theories as to where the very first case of infection may have occurred — the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of new coronavirus infection was probably on 1 December 2019 in the town of Hubei Province of Wuhan, China.
The number of cases of coronavirus infections in Hubei Province has gradually increased during the month.
They were mainly related to Huangyan's wholesale market for seafood, where living animals were also sold, and one of the theories was that the virus had entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus was zoonic. On 26 December, a case of mass pneumonia of unknown origin was reported by Dr. Zhang Tianjin, who reported on 27 December to the Centre for the Control and Prevention of Jiang's Diseases in Wahan City.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at the central clinic of Wuhan warned her colleagues of “SARS-like crownwork”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlan, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumours, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was convicted by his superiors for causing panic.
Later, on 31 December, Uhanha Municipal Health Commission issued a public notification and informed WHO of the situation.
In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be large enough to initiate an investigation early in January, doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by Chinese New Year's holidays and the fact that Uhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to later official data, by 20 January 2020, the symptoms of the disease had already reached 6,174 people. As of 26 March, the United States had defeated China and Italy on the largest number of confirmed cases worldwide. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases of infection had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and territories recorded at least one reported case of infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Shangen zone have restricted their freedom of movement and have established border controls.
National response measures included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory stay at home, compulsory shelter or isolation), as well as curfews. As of 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population of the United States, were in some form quarantine, more than 50 million persons in isolation from the Philippines, some 59 million persons in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure increased to 2.6 billion — about one third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Uhana on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the validity of which was not verified, the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jissian was working on a case of mass pneumonia of an unknown type, which was notified by the Centre for Monitoring and Prevention of Jiangang's Disease in Wuhan City on 27 December.
The initial genetic testing of patients ' samples, which took place on 27 December 2019, revealed the existence of a sARS-like coroner.
On 31 December, the Uhanha Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In response to such reports, the police warned doctors in Uhan about the responsibility for “hearing proliferation” of outbreaks.
Initially, the National Health Commission of China claimed that there was no “real evidence” of the ability of the newly detected virus to transmit from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, later referred to as the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Jinping, as the “people's war”.
The events of “the largest quarantine in human history” began to unfold, and on 23 January the border was announced and the ban on entry to and from Uhan was banned, and a total of 15 cities in the province of Hubei were subsequently extended to a total of 57 million people.
The use of personal transportation was banned in the city.
Celebrations on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (25 January) were abolished in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Huoshenhan, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Laishenhan, was built and hosted by other incoming patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China has also re-surveyed 14 other facilities in Uhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to curb the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year observance period.
Universities and schools have been closed all over the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, including with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have established remote working arrangements.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in and outside Hubei province.
Public transport had been modified and museums all over China had been temporarily closed.
In many cities, a citizen control regime was introduced and it was estimated that some 760 million people (over half the population) faced some form of open-air restrictions and that after the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities had taken strict measures to prevent imports of the virus from other countries.
In Beijing, for example, 14 days ' compulsory quarantine was introduced for all international travellers entering the city; as of 23 March, there was only one case of intra-country transmission from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul five days earlier.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister Lee Katzang of China reported that the spread of intra-country diseases had largely been halted and China's outbreak had been controlled.
On the same day, the travel restrictions to Hubei other than Uhana were lifted, two months after the closure of the province for quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with visas or residence permits would be suspended as from 28 March, and the exact date for the withdrawal of the order was not known.
Those wishing to come to China would have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called upon enterprises and factories to resume their work and provided companies with monetary incentive packages. On 4 April, a national three-minute “minute silence” was held, which opened the day of mourning on the victims of the coronaviour announced by the State Council of the country and coincided with Queenmin's festival, but the Central Government requested citizens to pay tribute to the victims online, respecting the physical distance, in order to avoid a recurrence of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had been extended to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in confirmed cases of disease, largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchongji.
Shinchongji’s followers came to Tegu from Uhanha, allegedly a source of outbreaks.
As at 22 February, of the 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) had reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea had the highest level of anxiety.
On 28 February, Korea recorded more than 2,000 confirmed cases, an increase of 3,150 as early as 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were placed on quarantine after three soldiers had confirmed the virus.
The outbreak has affected the number of flights and hence the flight schedule of airlines has been changed, and South Korea has launched a programme to screen the population on the existence of the virus, to monitor contacts and to organize quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered to be the largest and best in terms of organization around the world.
The screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile application by all visitors from abroad, a cross-cutting testing of the virus, the results of which were prepared the following day, and increased testing capacity, which allowed for daily testing of up to 20,000 people.
The South Korean programme was considered successful in fighting the outbreak of disease, despite the fact that cities had not been isolated; initially, South Korean society had been divided because of President Mun Jae In ' s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called on Mr. Mun ' s impeachment to respond to the outbreak of the disease, in their view.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of infections per day within four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed on two weeks ' quarantine.

Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to subject quarantine to entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be placed on quarantine.
Plans to restrict intercity travel were announced in March, but intensive intercity movement continued prior to the Persian New Year.
Shiite shrines in Kume remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, and Iran became the focal point for the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the backdrop of claims of concealing the extent of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February, more than 10 countries had linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the extent of the outbreak there could be more serious than the 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members were reported to have positive results on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent and to temporarily release all prisoners suitable for this category.
The organization claims that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons, where adequate medical care is lacking.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths per day — the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronavirus were reported in Iran every hour and 1 new death from coronavior every 10 minutes.
According to the representative of WHO, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
United States sanctions against Iran are also expected to affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had called for the alleviation of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had reached Italian territory when two Chinese tourists had a positive outcome of the SARS-COV-2 tests in Rome.
The number of infections has increased rapidly, prompting the Government of Italy to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 infections was later found. It started with 16 confirmed cases in Lombard on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed on quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “Entering and leaving the disease outbreak zone will be closed.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as 100 people had already been killed in Italy.

As at 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardria region.
A CNN report notes that a combination of two factors — the large number of older citizens of that country and the lack of capacity to survey all those who are now becoming conaviruses — can contribute to such a high mortality rate in Italy.
The United Kingdom had responded most calmly to the virus from all the affected countries and, until 18 March 2020, the British Government had not obliged citizens to observe any form of social distance or quarantine.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not reacting sufficiently quickly and seriously to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending refraining from all travel and social contacts that were not of primary importance, inviting people to work from their homes as far as possible and to avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment institutions, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but no more than £2,500 per month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent measures for social distance, prohibiting more than two persons from gathering and limiting travel and active rest in the fresh air only in cases of extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by the police, fines and assembly.

Despite this, testing of the population in the United States did not begin immediately, and the true extent of the outbreak was hidden during that period.
The test was difficult because of the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence of Federal Government permission by the end of February to use non-State test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, and restrictive criteria before the beginning of March to allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done at the appointment of a medical doctor).
The Washington Post reported that by 27 February less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that by 13 March, fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of Bali ' s 20 most popular tourist routes, the least ready for outbreak was identified, while Australian cities are considered to be the most prepared. Australia adopted its emergency plan for the new coronary (COVID-19) on 7 February.
In this regard, much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and Australia will pay particular attention to border controls and communications in a threatening situation.
On 21 March, Australia declared a human biosecurity emergency.

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.
WHO noted that there was a marked difference between the situation of typical pneumonia that occurred between 2002 and 2004, during which Chinese authorities were accused of concealing information, which allegedly prevented prevention and control of the spread of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, in which the central Government “regularly updated the situation to avoid panic before the New Year of China”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a ban on traffic in Uhan, the representative of WHO, Goden Galea, noted that although “this measure was definitely not recommended by WHO”, it was also “a very important indication of the implementation of the obligation to contain the epidemic at the most common place”, and called it “unprecedented in public health history”. On 30 January, after confirmation of the ability to transmit infection from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of infections in other countries, WHO declared a public health emergency situation of international importance (PCHEIC); this was the sixth situation since 2009, when it was first applied during the pig flu pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan, said that the PCHEIC announcement was due to “a global crisis, especially in low- and middle-income countries lacking reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested $675 million from the world community to provide strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need to provide urgent assistance to those countries that “have no systems to detect people infected by the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is a state of preparedness for our weakest epidemic” and called upon the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay for the future.” At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antônio Guterres had agreed to provide “the capacity of the entire United Nations system to respond to the problem”.
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group, coordinating all United Nations responses, has been established; these steps, as WHO states, will allow “to focus on health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to fight the outbreak of disease more socially and economically”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc team that ensured the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in addressing the situation within the country and to assess the “serious nature of the disease and its infection”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of the provincial and district response, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronaviour pandemic, noting that it is too early to call the disease pandemic, but countries must nevertheless be prepared to do so”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint assessment team. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of global expansion of the coronaviour would be raised from “high” to “highest” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: “This is a test by every government on the planet of the state of affairs: it is time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready," and stressed that the right response can help the world to avoid “the worst scenario of events”.
Ryan also stated that current data did not serve as a basis for the global pandemic to be declared public health officials, and added that the pandemic announcement would mean that “we are in fact recognizing that everyone on the planet will be at risk of being infected with this virus”.
On March 11, WHO announced the outbreak of the coroner’s pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO “is deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high incidence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction associated with the problem.” WHO is seriously criticized for the perceived inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including later announcement of a public health emergency and classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the current situation, Mr. Tedros Adanam, Director-General of WHO, was asked to resign, which was signed by 733,000 as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized the importance of respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to take life-saving measures against him and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not in any way justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners and refugees and other unknown groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has set up a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses worldwide, as well as to provide views and recommendations.
The digital network contains information on the policy measures taken by different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the world economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel constraints to help countries learn from each other and to promote a coordinated global response to the coroner.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the British Cabinet Minister Michael Gowa and Eduardo Bolsonor, son of President Jair Bolsonor of Brazil, for his actions in the fight against the pandemic, which began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of Chinese Communist Party leaders (CPC) were dismissed for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these dismissals were a sign of a lack of political reaction to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Jinpin, from public anger over the outbreak of the coronaviour.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the coronaviour outbreak had begun in Uhan but had taken sides with the theory that COVID-19 had arisen in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration referred to the coronary virus as “Chinese virus” or “Uhan’s virus”, stating that“ China’s censorship is only exacerbating the situation of the virus, which has now become a global pandemic”, which has been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and is“ distracting from the inability of the U.S. President’s administration to contain the spread of the disease”.
The Daily Beast received access to the U.S. government telegram, which contains a communications strategic trick that appears to have been developed by the National Security Council, and there are such references to the strategy: “It’s all in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any possible way, including press conferences and television speeches.” Organizations such as Politito, Foreign Policy and Blogberg stated that China's efforts to assist countries affected by the virus are part of a “advocative attack” to gain global influence.
The Head of the EU Foreign Policy Department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitical component which includes the struggle for influence through a piara and so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is pushing forward the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, as opposed to that of the United States”.
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and reportedly sent aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned by the United States sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of sending aid intended for other countries to their own country.
Other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy, also had disputes over medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has assigned hundreds of IWL machines to Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronary Italy.
Mauricio Massari, the Italian Ambassador to the EU, said that “China alone has responded bilaterally.
This does not clearly indicate European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conté of Italy, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the dispatch of Russian military ambulances, specialized disinfectant transport and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “useless or of little value to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on world public opinion at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President Lombardía Attillo Fontana and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy Luigi De Mayo rejected the media attacks and expressed their gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
The Spokesperson of the Kremlin Dmitri Peskov stated that “by offering assistance to United States colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American producers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they will also be able to respond when necessary”.
NATO Defence 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — the largest NATO post-cold-war military exercises — will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized Defender 2020's teachings: “In the public health crisis today, these exercises endanger the lives of not only the United States military and many European participating countries, but also residents of countries where such activities are to take place.” The Iranian Government has been severely affected by the virus, and some two dozen members of Parliament have been infected, as well as fifteen other current or former politicians.
On 14 March 2020, President Hassan Ruhani of Iran addressed an open letter to world leaders requesting assistance, stating that his country had difficulty combating the epidemic because of lack of access to international markets for sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic called on the United States to adopt social policies that were common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified system of health care and childcare, paid family leave and increased funding for public health.
Politicians expected this to affect the chances of Donald Trump's re-election in the 2020 presidential election, and the pandemic has worsened diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticized Japan's “flexible and passive quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any citizen coming from South Korea would be placed on two weeks' quarantine in Government-specific seats.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Mun Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called on Mr. Mun ' s impeachment to respond inadequately to the outbreak of the disease; the pandemic forced countries to enact emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators express concern that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orban indefinite authority to administer the decrees, suspend the work of Parliament, and hold elections and punish those who would be accused of disseminating fair information on the virus and Government responses to the crisis.
The coronaviour flash was identified as causing several supply deficits due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the procurement of goods in panic and the disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings on the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and vendor disruptions.
There were also panicking purchases in several localities, leading to the disappearance of basic goods, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which, in turn, led to a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to Mr. Tedros Adanama, Director General of WHO, the demand for individual remedies has increased 100 times.
This leap has resulted in a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It has also caused a lack of personal protection worldwide, and WHO has warned that health workers will be targeted for this reason.
In Australia, because of the pandemic, Daigo buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities have led to a lack of food for children in some supermarkets and have since been banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high incidence of COVID-19 incidents in northern Italy and the Uhan region, as well as high food demand, food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illicit trade in critical products, which have proved successful, have helped to avoid the severe food shortage expected in Europe as well as North America.
North Italy, with small-scale agricultural production, had not experienced significant declines, but industry representatives believed that agricultural prices could rise.
Food shops were left empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials ensured access to pigs stocks to ensure that the population was well fed.
Similar laws requiring food producers to store food supplies in case of emergency also exist in Italy.
China was affected by the damage caused by the world economy: according to the media of 16 March, China ' s economy suffered greatly in the first two months of 2020 because of the Government ' s response to the spread of the virus, which reduced retail sales by 20.5 per cent.
Mother China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, a viral outbreak is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agata Demarai, a member of the Economic Intelligence Unit, predicts that market volatility will continue until there is a clearer picture of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current global growth epidemic could surpass the effects of the 2002-2004 SAR epidemic.
In one of the assessments made by an expert at the University of Washington, St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has taken “immediate measures” following a sharp drop in oil prices due to a fall in demand from China.
On 24 February, world stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing fears about the coroner’s outbreak, various United States stock indices, including NASAQ-100, S&P 500 and Doo-Johns index for industrial shares, showed the most dramatic decline since 2008, with the Dou index falling by 1,191 items — the largest one-day fall after the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10% drop.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The actions fell again due to concerns about the expansion of the coronaviour, and the worst fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a possibility of economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with restrictions on movement, closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and recommendations by Governments not to travel.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines have cancelled flights owing to the sharp decline in the demand for airline tickets, including British Airways, China East Airlines and Quantas, and the British regional airline Flybe has ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise industry has been more powerful than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry transport ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chang-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
National and regional Governments have abolished a number of activities involving large numbers of people, including annual New Year's festivals; private companies have also closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year ' s events had been cancelled and tourist attractions had been closed to prevent mass groups of people; for example, the Ban City had been closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs had been abolished.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and districts in China, the authorities extended the New Year's holidays until 10 February, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the response rate to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared an emergency by closing schools until March and by cancelling the New Year's celebration, the retail sector has suffered globally: the shop hours have been reduced and some shops have been temporarily closed.
Visits to retail markets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, trade points dropped by 33-43 per cent in March compared to February.
Trade point operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, the installation of public temperature control equipment and the cancellation of activities; according to an assessment by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic may leave 14-22 million more people behind the line of poverty than would have been the case in a similar situation but without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Uhan epidemic, some 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their own provinces or locked up in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought assistance from the Government.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the outbreak of coronaviour can deprive 47 million people of their jobs, and the unemployment rate can reach 32 per cent. Self-inseparation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers receiving daily fees without employment. A study by the Angus Reid Institute revealed that 44 per cent of Canadian households have suffered unemployment in one way or another.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for one social benefit. Almost half a million companies in Germany moved their employees to government-subsidized reduced working hours, part-time.
The German part-time pay scheme was also introduced in France and Great Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic that has affected the activities of organizations, as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, worldwide.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often financed by the State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, and supporting the arts wherever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed indefinitely or had been restricted to varying degrees and exhibits, events and presentations had been cancelled or postponed to other dates.
An active effort has been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms; yet another recent and growing impact of the spread of the virus has been the abolition of religious services, major sports events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the abolition of the activities of the Holy Week in Rome during the last week of the Christian repentant period — the Great Post.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services began broadcasting on radio, live television, or on television, while some church leaders offer to carry out services in the open air.
The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closed up its churches, shrines and Saint Peter ' s area, where Christian pilgrims are no longer present, and later other religious organizations have also abolished services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdets.
The Iranian Ministry of Health had announced the abolition of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the coronaviour and the shrines had been closed; Saudi Arabia had prohibited the access of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since the Second World War.
Most of the major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Championships League 2019-20, the Prime League 2019-20, the EUFA Euro 2020, the NBA season 2019-20 and the NFL season 2019-20.
The coronaviour flash also destroyed plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were due to begin in late July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transmitted beyond 2020 but no later than summer 202”. Kazino and other gambling institutions around the world were closed and poker tournaments, which were usually broadcast live, were also either transferred or cancelled.
This has resulted in many players moving online and many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have also canceled all their plays.
As an alternative to traditional off-line activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results over the Internet, providing direct webcasting or web-festuring; this helps people in creative professions to continue to perform, publish or publish their works.
There are many web-based memories of coronaviour, many of which are jumoist and have smoothed the alarming moods of periods of uncertainty.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, prejudice, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as people of hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries, have increased.
There have been cases of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
The February news reports (when most cases of infection were still limited to China) recorded racist attitudes expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retribution for anything.
In some African countries, there is also an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Uhanha and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Both off-line and online support was provided to Chinese citizens and their residents living in areas affected by the virus.
The epidemic had begun to spread in new countries, particularly Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; therefore, citizens of such regions could also begin to experience the effects of suspicion and xenophobia; citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea had signed a petition at an early stage, insisting that Chinese citizens should not enter their countries to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag # ChinaDontCommeToJapan (Chinese) took the lead positions in Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report an increasing level of racist sentiment and even attacks.
President Donald Trump of the United States was criticized for calling the coronary a “Chinese virus”, which critics consider to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protestors attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuees from Uhan to New Sanjara.
Students coming from North-East India, China, who are studying in large cities in India, reported persecutions related to the outbreak of the coronaviour.
Dilip Ghosh, President of the State Unit of Bharatia Janata Party, West Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that was why God avenged them”.
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, which described them as “a subjugation” in China because of the pandemic, once again xenophobia and racism against non-Chinans: foreigners were referred to as “a foreign garbage” and “a disposal facility”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions on some or all areas affected by the coronaviour.
Many editors have made available their scientific articles on the outbreak of coronaviour.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their studies on pre-printers' servers, such as bioRxiv.

The smuggling of wild animals and diseases from animals are health risks associated with the trade in exotic animals.
The laboratory testing of the respiratory coroner 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-COV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the crown's RNA.
This test is specific and intended only to detect the SARS-COV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
Antitele detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people suffering from the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated at the hospital or who were not present at all.
The exact level of death from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests conducted in different countries was highly contradictory.
These differences in information are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly exaggerated.
With a polymeroses chain reaction, real-time reverse (RRT-PCR) tests can be performed on airway samples obtained in various ways, including a sludge mask or a sludge sample.
The results are usually available for a period of between several hours and two days.
OA-PCD test, which was carried out on throat brushes, is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later on, the virus may disappear from its throat, but it may continue to multiply in the lungs.
Infection patients tested during the second week of the disease may alternatively take the material from the lower respiratory pathways by means of a cutting-off catheter, or use the products of the meats (mocrota).
One of the early PCR tests was developed at Charite Hospital, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time polymerosed chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 sets subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its own test. On 28 January 2020, Kogenebiotech, a South Korean company, had developed a set of SARS-COV-2 detections based on a clinically PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the gene "E" common to all beta-Kornaurs, and the gene RdRp, special for SARS-COV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group became one of the first companies authorized by the National Drug Administration of China to use the SARS-COV-2 package on an emergency basis based on PRC. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnostic panel through the International Reagent Resource organization to carry out RT-PCD in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagonic Panel in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from older versions of the test sets produced incomplete results due to married reagents and a narrow area of CDC testing in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples per day were processed successfully throughout February 2020.
The two-part tests were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was only after that date that State and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Quality Supervisory Office as part of an emergency application permit, and the US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 based on RT-CPD across the country.
Quest Diagnostics started testing COVID-19 throughout the country with effect from 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were stated; the sampling and processing of analyses should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Center for Research and Research in Antiquology and Biotechnology, WECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Oversight Service and it was reported that Mayo Hospital had developed a COVID-19 test on 12 March 2020. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by FDA for a test which could be conducted within 3.5 hours for large quantities of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency authorization to Abbott laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; previously, FDA issued similar permission to Holological, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Sepheid also gets the FDA from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
FDA has also approved a test that uses an amplification technology for isothermal Nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, it can only detect positive results in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At present, there are about 18,000 vehicles in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a mono-loned antibodies test, which is specifically linked to the new coroner (N-white) protein, and it is hoped that results can be obtained within 15-20 minutes, such as a flu express test.
The March 2020 review of specialized literature concluded that “the breast tentgenograms have a small diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of the CTC [computer tomography] can be of such value even before symptoms appear”.
Typical characteristics identified by the CTC include bilateral multi-dimensional sub-tribal sealing focal points for the type of “mattic glass” with offshore, asymmetric and apostoric distribution.
Sub-tribal dominance, the symptom of a bludgeon bridge and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Uhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that the CTC is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, because many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published the recommendation “not to use the CTC for screening or as a method of testing the first line in the COVID-19 diagnosis”. As of March 2020, CDC recommended using the PCR method for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to the infection is expressed in the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection from people after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to conduct popular monitoring; analyses can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by local diagnosis (POCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-production automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each system.
CLT usually uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples may also be used to track the immune response.
In POCT, one blood sample is usually produced by the permeability of each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need for a sampling phase. On March 26, 2020, FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to pass their tests on antibodies.
As of 7 April 2020, FDA approved only one emergency application test. At the end of March 2020, the European Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were granted European permits to use their test kits that could detect Igg and IgA antibodies in blood samples capable of combating the virus.
The test capacity is several hundred samples per hour and therefore works much faster than the normal RNA PCR.
In early April, Britain found that none of its antibody test kits was satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients suspected of being infected to stay at home: “The emergency room staff shall pass a test tube to the patient”, the patient spits in it, returns it and receives the results of the test. The British NHS announced that it had launched its pilot system for testing suspicious cases in domestic settings that would eliminate the risk of infection by the patient of other visitors to clinics, or that it would be necessary to disinfect the ambulance if used for the patient's transport. During an express test on COVID-19 in suspicious cases, the medical worker will take an analysis using all appropriate precautions.
Express testing centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than any other country. On 2 March, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors in Germany stated that it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient conditions, and a week earlier they could only perform 11,700 tests a week.
If the examination is ordered by a doctor, the costs shall be covered by medical insurance.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s total performance in testing amounts to 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, it was proposed to conduct a test in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that at the calendar week 12/2020, a total of 483,295 tests, up to the week 12/2020, inclusive, and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent), were positive. The researchers at Israeli clinics, Technion and Ramam Hospital, developed and tested the simultaneous test method for 64 patients, combining samples and carrying out further analyses only if the combined sample shows a positive result. On 5 February 2020, BGI opened an interim laboratory of 2,000 square metres to detect emergency cases called "Hoo-Yang" (Chinese eye), which could process more than 10,000 samples a day.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Jiang and completed in only five days; the simulation showed that if the laboratory had not been put in operation at such an accelerated pace, the incidence of the disease in Hubea would have been 47 per cent higher and the quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
At the opening of the laboratory in Uhan, a total of 12 cities in China were opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
By 4 March 2020, daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day, with open origami Assays multix circuits, which can be tested up to 1,122 patients ' COVID19 tests using only 93 test tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, excluding the need for robotic liquid manipulations.
By March, owing to insufficient and insufficient reagents, mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States was problematic.
As a result, some authors have requested test-processing protocols, which provide for the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates per capita test was currently being conducted in excess of any other country and the majority of the population would soon be tested.
This was due to rapid testing opportunities, along with the acquisition of mass testing laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Hu-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, which is deployed in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-CPD tests per day and is the world's first laboratory of such magnitude working outside China.
Various test options have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of test kits that are sent to low-income countries without resources to develop their own sets.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States health and epidemiological centres was not available until 28 January, resulting in a lack of testing kits in the United States. Early in the outbreak in China and the United States there were problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts claim that the wide availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the new coroner.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programmes as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many of the U.S. private laboratories, which had received hundreds of thousands of samples, were overloaded and stocks of materials were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by CDC had “deficits”, and for that reason the Government had removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private development of the tests, and Spain had acquired test kits from Shenzen Bioesy Biotechnology Co Ltd, a Chinese firm, but had found that the use of these sets was not accurate.
The firm explained that failure of sampling or misuse of sets could result in inaccuracies.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the wrong results sets and replace them with other sets — the Shenzen Bioasy kits. 80 per cent of the tests that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had failed. 1.2 million test sets acquired by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović proposed that they be dropped in the Danube; Atesh Kara, a member of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the tests acquired in China had a “high level of error” and the Ministry “did not use them”. Great Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 announced that these sets were not suitable for use.
Quarantine measures for those whose analyses have had a positive effect on the SARS-COV-2, as well as monitoring of the people contacted by such patients, have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Vaud, where the first man died from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two testing cycles for an entire population of some 4,300 at intervals of about ten days.
About half of those with positive results had no symptoms and all patients with confirmed cases had been placed on quarantine.
The entry into the area of the settlement was closed and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, the coroner's pandemic of 2020 in Singapore was much less intense than in other developed countries, and extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and shops were not imposed.
Many activities were cancelled, and on 28 March, Singapore urged residents to stay at home, but schools where vacations ended on 23 March were scheduled.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive surveillance of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, but restrictions have been less aggressive.
A statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were conducted than in the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with weak symptoms or lack of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without mass testing resources, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first 10 negative results of COVID-19 tests to one of the 16 WHO testing laboratories for validation testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
On the next schedule, the indicators for the `positive ' column depend on the country-specific testing policy.
A country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher percentage of the positive results than a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, with other equal conditions.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is a process of clearing hands to remove pollution, fat, micro-organisms or other harmful substances.
Regular hand-washing at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral means.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold, for example, if he touches his eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucus) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which hands should be washed with soap: before and after defecation, after raising a child's berries or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating, before and after cooking or handling raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with the help of the ashes, and the World Health Organization recommends that the hands be washed:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after procedures for caring for a sick person.
After a change of diapers or a bath of a child going to the toilet.
After shrivelling, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
The health of the hand refers to the hygiene associated with medical procedures.
The washing of hands before taking drugs or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical aim of hand - washing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease), as well as from chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who cook food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Hand washing is very beneficial for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coroner and other infectious diseases, prevents communicable diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
and also reduces infant mortality rates at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by taking simple habits, such as washing hands and soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of hand washing can reduce diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water to low-income regions.
The 48 per cent reduction in diarrhoea can be linked to washing hands and soap, and washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (PRDs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of the Ori, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Almost 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands before and after eating can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reducing diarrhoeal mortality by almost half, and mortality from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
The washing of hands is usually combined with other sanitation activities under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hands also prevent the emergence of an impetuous disease, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying and, consequently, damage to the skin.
A 2012 Danish study showed that too often hand - washing can lead to rudder and skin - a disease known as eczema or hand - dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often hand-washing can also be considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (CRD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when hand-washing with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal ororal transmission: after defecation (poison, defecation), after a baby's milking (pumping), before feeding the child, before taking food and before/after cooking or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of a cut or wound, after a sneeze, cough or shrivelling, after contact with wastes of animal origin or animal, after contact with garbage.
In many countries, hand - washing and soaping is relatively rare.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 showed that, on average, 38.7 per cent of families were washed away with soap. The 2014 study showed that the highest figure, 97 per cent, was in Saudi Arabia; the United States was closer to the middle, 77 per cent; the lowest was in China, 23 per cent; there are currently several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing habits of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group washing of hands by school children at a given time of day is one such methodology that helps to train children in such a procedure.
The Emergency Health Programme, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of extensive efforts to improve child health and education.
This national programme is based on de-worming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand-washing with soap and daily tooth cleaning with fluorine.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if soap or detergent are added to the process of washing.
The main action of soap and cleaning materials is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water in itself is not considered an effective means of cleaning skins, since fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are poorly dissolved in water.
Sufficient quantities of water, however, contribute to the process of cleansing.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may be used in previous use.
A small number of studies on the impact of contaminated solid soap bacteria on every cover suggest that they are not likely to be exposed because bacteria are mixed with foam.
The CDC still maintains that “liquid soap with hand dosage is the preferred hand-washing option”.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in health - care communities.
There is no evidence to date that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectant means has selective effects on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosane, which is resistant to a host of resistance strains of organisms.
Thus, even if strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be consistent with those advertised.
In addition to surface-active substances and skin protection, complex compounds can contain acids (oxygenic, asparagusic, milky) as a control of pH, as well as anti-micro active benzene acid and other wastes (alue Vera, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health revealed that in terms of disease prevention and the removal of bacteria from the skin, simple soaps are as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclosane.
Hot water, comfortable for human skins, is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria are multiplied much faster at 37 °C.
However, to remove natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria, hot soap is more efficient than cold water.
Contrary to popular opinion, scientific research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on hands.
A hand - disinfectant (sanitizer) or a hand - control antiseptic is a hand - hygiene device that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st centurys, there was an increase in the popularity of hand hygiene products on a alcohol-free basis (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, antiseptics for hand-infection or sanitizers).
Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, with the addition of inhibitors such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel or wetting, such as liquid or foam glycerin, which makes it easier to use these products and reduces the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide increases anti-microtic activity, and disinfectants containing a minimum of 60 to 95 per cent alcohol effectively destroy germs.
Decontamination on a alcohol-based basis kills bacteria, including multi-drug bacteria (MRSA and VRE), a tuberculosis stick, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rini virus, vaccination, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
Decontaminations containing 70 per cent alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (logs of decline of 3.5 by 35 decibels) in their hands 30 seconds after use, and 99.99 per cent kill 99.999 per cent bacteria (logs of reduction of 4-5) in their hands 1 minute after use.
Decontaminations on a alcohol basis are practically ineffective against neurovirus (or Nrwalk) viruses of the type, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of antiseptics or alcohol-containing drugs must be used to carefully process and poll the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and back surface of both palms, as well as the space between fingers throughout the length, will grow for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is fully absorbed.
The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hand-washing rather than the use of disinfectants should also be carefully washed on both hands, especially if the hands are severely contaminated.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand-washing if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants may cause skin dryness if their composition does not contain mitigating agents and (or) skin-wetting agents.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glytherin and (or) other mitigating substances to the substance.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing mitigating components caused much less irritation and dryness of the skin than soap or antimacterial cleaning agents.
The allergy contact dermatitis, contact droplets syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or supplements present in disinfectants are practically non-existent.
A lower probability of irritable contact dermatite has been a factor in selecting disinfectants than soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water - free equipment does not clean up their hands from organic substances but simply disinfects them.
For this reason, disinfectants for the hands are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens, such as soap and water, since pathogenic micro-organisms still remain in their hands with such means.
The effectiveness of the disinfectant for alcohol-free hands depends to a large extent on the components and composition, and has historically been much lower than for alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
More recently, it has been proved that the drugs used are resistant and cumulative anti-microtic activity, as opposed to alcohol, which has been proved to be ineffective after repeated use, probably due to progressive side reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with gold or clay.
The oil or clay can be more efficient than just water, but it will always be less efficient than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or salt is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, gold is a disinfectant, since contact with water creates a uterine solution.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of gold or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend the use of hand-washing techniques, including the following steps:
Refrigerate your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that running water be used because standing water can be contaminated, but the temperature of water is not important.
Wear your hands, growing them with a lot of soap, including the back of your hand, as well as areas between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that when soap (not just one water) is used, people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Three hands for at least 20 seconds.
Tension helps remove germs from your skin, and the longer you hold your hands, the more microbes are removed.
Refrigerate your hands under running water.
The spraying of the hands in the standing water may trigger a second infection.
Remove your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry themselves.
The breasts and wet hands are more easily polluted, and most often people ignore areas such as the thumb, wrist, toe and under the fingernails.
Artificial nails and crushed nail blades can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that wet lotion be used to prevent the drying of hands that can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many low-cost ways to wash hands: pouring water out of a hanging canist or bottle-boiled pumping with the openings made and (or) use of gold if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. There are water-saving solutions in areas with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries) such as knife taps and other low-cost options.
The knife pedal tap is a simple structure consisting of a bag suspended on a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to pour water on its hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
An effective hand drying is an integral part of hand hygiene, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing amount of research shows that paper towels are far more healthy than the hand dryers installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London carried out a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Salphets and Cotton, which was the subject of a comparison of the hygiene of paper cloths, hot air dryers and more modern hand-flow air dryers.
After washing and drying hands in a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the pillows of the fingers was found to increase by 194 per cent on average and 254 per cent on the palms.
It has also been found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with air current, the total number of bacteria on the pillows of the fingers increases by 42 per cent and on the palms by 15 per cent.
After washing and drying the hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the pillows of the fingers decreases to 76 per cent on average and to 77 per cent on ladonates, and scientists also tested the possibility of cross-contamination of several visitors to toilet rooms and toilet environments for each type of drying.
The air dryer, which releases air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing micro-organisms out of the hand and out of its own unit and is capable of inflammating other users of the toilet room and sled within a radius of up to 2 m.
The use of hot - air dryers spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters [0.25 m] from the dryer.
No significant micro-organisms were found using paper cloths. In 2005, T–V Produkt und Umwelt carried out an assessment study on various methods of drying hands.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of drying the hands:
There are many different hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared with paper towels drying.
Cleaning hands with disinfecting napkins can be an alternative solution during travels without soap and water.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant shall contain not less than 60 per cent alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing was mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignatz Zemelweis found it highly effective (1846) in preventing disease in hospital.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices is indeed helping to reduce infection.
The medical washing of hands lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water, or gel to wash and counteract each part of the hand.
Hands should be carefully lost to each other with their fingers crossed.
If there's dirt underneath your nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water in their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them clean with a clean towel.
A paper towel should be used after drying the hands by closing the tap and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors.
This avoids re-pollution of hands from these surfaces.
The aim of hand-washing in health facilities is to remove pathogens (microbes) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand - washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus spread micro-organisms.
One study, hand-washing and other basic procedures may reduce bloodletting infections related to the use of a catheter by 66 per cent, and the World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard procedure for hand washing and handling, which should be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open to public discussion.
The corresponding review was carried out by Whitby in his co-authority.
Commercial devices can be used to measure indicators and verify hand hygiene if regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization identifies “five moments” when it is necessary to wash hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
the use of anti-septics, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap in hand washing (“medical” or “anti-micro” soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
These antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgical operations are performed or in an environment with high levels of antibiotic resistant organisms. For “cleaning” hands before surgical surgery, a tap is required, which can be turned on and off without touching its hands; a little chlorhexide or iodized water should also be used for arm treatment, sterilized hand dryer towels after washing, sterilized sacs for friction and other sterilized cleaning tools.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires a washing of hands and a forearm to the elbow usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
There's no need to lose hands too long, like 10 minutes.
During the spraying, the forearm water shall not fall back on the hands.
After the wash is finished, the hands dry with a veal cloth and put on a surgical coat.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after the procedures for caring for a sick person.
In order to combat staphylocopic infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of washing was most beneficial, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to washing antibacterial soaps, hand washing by conventional soap results in more than threefold increases in the frequency of bacterial communicable diseases transmitted through food, a comparison of hand resistance by alcohol-containing solution and hand washing by antibacterial soap, on average 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the treatment of hands by alcohol-containing solutions reduced bacterial pollution by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand-in-hand alcohol solutions, in terms of reducing the number of flu A H1N1 viruses on the hands and in the dispute of the Clostridium Deficiency Deficiency Dispute, which may include hand-washing training, increased availability of alcohol-containing solutions on the hands, and written and oral reminders to staff of the need to wash their hands.
Further research is needed on best practices in various health facilities.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap has been recognized as a cost-effective and important means of improving health and even nutrition.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or equipment to wash hands in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to develop regular hand - washing habits.
For example, most rural areas in Africa do not have hand-washing taps in every private or public toilet, although there are cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits, not lack of soap or water.
Promoting and stimulating hand-washing with soap can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term changes in public behaviour.
Monitoring and evaluation of results are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
Systematic analysis of 70 studies has found that, in order to improve hand hygiene in lower middle-income countries, health and epidemiological surveillance at the community level is effective, while public marketing campaigns are less effective; one example of advocacy for hand-washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's Fund's Tree Star Approach approach, which promotes simple economic measures in schools that encourage washing of hands by students using soap, as well as other health requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
The installation of handholders is one possible measure implemented through hand health awareness campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
The Global Hand Dating Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour, as a result of the 2019-20 coroner's pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of a hand-washing emotion.
Some studies examined the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in comparison with DALYs (retained years of life without disabilities).
However, one study suggests that the promotion of hand-washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or early soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), English nurse and “founder of modern care for patients”.
At the time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by rotten smells called misadventures.
In the 1980s, owing to outbreaks of disease through the digestive tract and infections associated with medical care, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important preventive measure.
As a result of the outbreak of pig flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with “right hand-washing techniques” were spread out near handwashers in public toilets, as well as in office buildings and airports.
The phrase “smart hands” means an expression of reluctance to accept responsibility for anything or to be a party to anything.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate ‘ washed his hands ’ when making a decision to crucify Jesus Christ; this phrase was subsequently more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's play, Lady McBeth starts to wash her hands reluctantly in an attempt to clean up the supposed stain of an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes she has committed herself and has caused her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who have remembered or witnessed any non-ethical act tend to wash their hands more frequently than others and are more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have been able to wash their hands after what they have seen will participate in any other “cleaning” countervailing activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, hand washing has both a sanitary purpose and a symbolic meaning; symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha ' is, Hinduism, tevilah and net y ' aym in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Woodhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the sanitary washing of hands, especially after certain actions have been taken.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam are required to wash their hands when they visit the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19
The control of production factors in relation to COVID-19 involves the use of safety and health techniques to control risk and combat the 2019 coroner (COVID-19).
Proper risk control in the workplace depends on location and work, based on risk assessment, the seriousness of the epidemic situation in the community and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable in relation to COVID-19.
The U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) reported that lower-risk posts had minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures were required to combat infection, including hand-washing, encourage workers to stay at home under the signs of illness, follow-up to respiratory ethics, and daily cleaning and decontamination of the working environment.
Posts at medium risk require frequent or close contact with people who have no confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or international travel.
This category may include workers in public contact such as schools, high-density working environments and some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic measures for the prevention of infection, include high-impact air filter ventilation, the use of shields and available personal protections in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA is of the view that medical personnel and morgues who have contacted a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 are at high risk; at the same time, the risk increases to a very high level in procedures accompanied by aerosol formation or in the collection/processing of human samples with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such personnel include the use of safety and engineering equipment, such as negative ventilation rooms, as well as personal protection equipment suitable for the purpose.
The COVID-19 flash may have different types of effects on the workplace.
Employees may be absent from the workplace because of their own illness, the need to care for others or because of fear of possible contamination.
Business templates may change with respect to both the types of goods that are in demand and the means of acquisition of such goods (e.g. purchase in non-tipal periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the vehicle).
Finally, there may be delays in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Plan for Preparedness and Response can be used for protection.
The plans address the risks associated with various jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors, emerging home and community, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic illness.
Plans also indicate the monitoring tools necessary to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans for epidemic preparedness and response can follow national or state recommendations.
Some of the goals of response to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, to protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, to maintain business operations and to minimize the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses are influenced by the severity of diseases in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health care to group such tools according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 is not addressed, the most effective safety and engineering equipment is available, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Engineering and safety equipment implies the isolation of staff from workplace-related risks and does not rely on the conduct of the employee, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in operational policies or procedures requiring action from an employee or staff member.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protection shall be selected according to the employee ' s threat, be sized (e.g. respirators), used continuously and properly, regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid infection.
The U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) is of the view that the lowest-risk posts have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
The basic measures to combat the epidemic, recommended for all jobs, include frequent and careful washing of hands, recommendations for sick workers to remain at home, compliance with respiratory label, including the closure of the mouth in coughing and schilling, the provision of naphets and garbage containers, the readiness for remote or replacement work, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, and the daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons potentially infected is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that staff with acute respiratory symptoms remain at home until the heat is over, the lack of heat and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of jagged drugs or other medications that eliminate symptoms, as well as requiring flexibility in sick leaves, allowing staff to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and ensuring that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a possibility of the contamination of SARS-COV-2 due to the spread of the disease in the community in the area where the business is located or to recent visits by such person to COVID-19 distribution sites.
These categories include public health workers, such as in schools, high-density workers and some large retailers. Engineering and safety equipment for such groups and higher-risk groups includes the installation of high-risk air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers such as transparent plastic shields and the installation of customer-friendly windows without leaving vehicles. Administrative measures for such groups and higher-risk groups include recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, replacement of personal meetings for virtual communications, the establishment of replacement schedules, the elimination of non-critical visits to COVID-19 distribution sites, the development of emergency communication plans, including a forum for responding to concern workers, the provision of relevant training for workers on risk factors of COVID-19 and protection measures, training of workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, the proper use of such equipment, the provision of resources and a working environment conducive to personal hygiene, the requirement of regular washing of hands, the restriction of access to labour by workers on risk factors of COVID-19 and the training of employees who are required to use protective clothing and equipment, the use of protective agents, and the protection of staff members of the staff, and staff members of the staff who are not required to carry out of the staff or staff members of the staff or staff members of the staff members of the staff, and the staff members of the staff members of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff or staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff or staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff, and of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff, and of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff and of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff and of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff and of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff and of the staff of the staff, and of the staff of the staff of the staff and of the staff of the staff, and of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff and of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff, and of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff, and of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff, and of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff and of the staff of the staff and of the staff of the staff and of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff and of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff and of the staff of the staff of the staff and of the staff of the staff and of the staff.
In rare cases, workers from such risk groups may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick on a plane, measures such as isolation of a sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, the provision of a mask to the patient, or the request to cover his nose and mouth with a cough or tea.
Secondary crew members must wear one-time medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when they are in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protections if the patient has heat, regular cough or breathing difficulties.
The gloves used and other single-time items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected; in cases of commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, safety measures included the postponement of travel in the event of illness, isolation and the immediate reporting of a medical centre to a ship in the event of heat or other symptoms from anyone on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should be carried out in an isolated cabin of such a person; in the case of schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends that a short-term cleaning or disinfecting closure be conducted if the person infected was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average rate of infection in the community, social distance strategies may be introduced, e.g. cancellation of visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as exercise or chorusing, taking meals in the cafes, increasing the distance between parties, setting the time of arrival and care, limiting non-significant visits, using the separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of proliferation in the local community, measures for long-term non-attendance of school may be considered in addition to social distance strategies; for law enforcement officials performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to CDC.
It is recommended that law enforcement officials who are required to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 should follow the same guidelines as prescribed by the ambulances, including the use of appropriate personal protection.
In cases of close contact during detention, employees must clear and disinfect their formal belts and embezzlement before re-use by domestic cleaning aerosols or anti-remnant, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and the disposal of personal remedies used, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health workers and morgues are at high or very high risk.
Posts with high risk include medical, support, laboratory and medical personnel who are in contact with patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
They have a very high risk of infection in procedures with aerosol formation, or in collecting/processing samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
Procedures accompanied by aerosol formation include sensing, coughing, bronze, certain dental procedures and surveys or collection of invasive samples.
High-risk morguers include staff working on the treatment of persons with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such personnel perform an opening, they are classified as very high-risk; additional safety and security equipment for such risk groups includes the use of isolated premises for patients with confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19, including procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.
Special ventilation with negative pressures may be an effective measure in some health institutions and morgues.
The samples should be treated with the precautions prescribed for biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to separate waiting areas, depending on the suspicion of a COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protections, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers who interact up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed disease or suspected SARS-COV-2 infection, as well as those who carry out procedures with aerosol formation.
In the United States, approved NIOSH respirators for a N95 or higher-class filter must be used as part of an integrated written programme for respiratory protection, which specifies individual selection requirements and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort for a staff member, WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory rather than physicologicly transmitted disease.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for personnel involved in screening at the patient reception point.
People collecting samples from respiratory tracts from patients with COVID-19 or those carrying the disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, WHO recommends wearing surgical masks, protective glasses or protective screens for the person, coats and gloves.
In the course of procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, the respirator N95 or FFP2 shall be replaced by a surgical mask.
In view of the insufficient availability of personal protection tools around the world, WHO recommends that the need for such protection be minimized through the use of remote medical capabilities, physical barriers, such transparent eyes, access to a patient infected by COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of personal protections required for a specific purpose, the prolonged use of the same respirator, without the removal of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the personal protection supply chain, and the recommendation not to use masks for persons without symptoms.

COVER: [Covid-19] Pressure relief and preparation for the future
DAT/LIGHT: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
DURATION: CC0: No protected rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interaction of people around the world and our responsibility to one another.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen the companionship and concern of all our colleagues, as reflected in electronic correspondence, calls, and chat rooms — a remarkable confirmation of the fact that fortunately we are being worked with by amazing people.
I speak with great gratitude and pride about you as colleagues.
Last week I was informed of our appreciation for our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to have access to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And it's possible because of your work, whether it's about making websites work, paying our colleagues or protecting the security of our communities.
The world needs the information provided in Wikipedia, and this is even more important today than ever before.
At such a time, it is important not only what we do but also how we do it in order to achieve meaningful results for the world.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way we work together, starting with the coming week.
Adjustments to our work and timetables
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
During our communication, we considered our ideas on how best to deal with the current situation and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The great majority of us wanted to remove the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to step back, let it be.
For all staff, contractors and freelance staff:
We expect to have to work about four hours a day or 20 hours a week before further orders are received.
We do not announce the weekend: if you can work normally for more hours, this is permitted for the purposes of our mission.
But the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether to care for your family, to buy food or to go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority number one.
We don't follow your working time.
If you're sick, don't work.
That's understandable and unquestionable, but we'll mention it.
A sick sheet or time off is not required: simply inform your supervisor and help the team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, please inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation.)
The full hourly rate would be paid.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to honour commitments to our contractors and to hourly pay.
Each person will be paid in accordance with normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This includes periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way of channeling their efforts into the world around us.
What we are doing can produce amazing results, especially in such times.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your leader so that we know what to expect and can adjust your actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered to be significant.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (including others) teams perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and shift our focus on support, which is essential for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we're just focusing on the most important projects.
Delay today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not intend to work “two more to make up for” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timetables whenever possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, thus enabling staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care, while all those who need or want to work will have a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, providing representatives and teams with relevant information on the next steps immediately upon receipt of appropriate confirmation.
Thank the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
But in addition to many precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used antiviral medical class decisions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as foster and elevator lobbyes, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building has its own rules of caution, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the time when we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Colombia (DC) is located on the WeWork network, which shared with us and all the staff on DC its COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in D.C. took a full remote job in accordance with instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of rental of premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues, working remotely, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If need be for longer sessions, consider breaking them into a course of several days.
Identify clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and forward the material for consultation in advance.
Use video communications by default, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and communication.
For ease, appoint a focal point, a person who will monitor questions in the chat room and monitor the list of speakers as well as the focal point (or joint spectator).
If necessary, contact the Technical Support Service by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimburation program when you buy a snack.
Join #remothies in the Black channel to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying guidelines on ergonomics available in web-based format to facilitate the effectiveness of distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the community to abolish the mass activities funded by Wikipedia, such as “editathons”, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such liftings and other restrictions may entail the impossibility of carrying out concerted grant activities, and no one will be fined for forced delays or modification of such objectives.
In the coming week, we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
Universal sentiment in the global community is not only frustration at the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief from mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikipedia and not only.
In terms of prospects, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page which will provide space for the community to monitor impacts and communication.
We remain in contact on COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 2 p.m. UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take advantage of the opportunity to further share current information, answer your questions and together spend time with each other.
We're together in this situation and we're ready to help everyone we can.
In doing so, you can continue to receive information from such electronic correspondence, while other important information on COVID-19 is from the Office of WikiLeaks.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are significantly affected by the current situation.
If questions of travel, activities, key workflows, issues of coverage or other assistance are involved, contact CRT.
We are prepared to provide support and liaison as necessary.
In case of confidentiality problems, please contact Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations, by e-mail.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a fundamental new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support one another and to enable one another to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary services.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Now is the time to support each other and to create space for the important work to be done in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
For that to happen, we need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families, as well as to work best as soon as such a need arises.
Now please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katheine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and the remaining members of the Leadship Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jane U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin turning enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the relevant angiotensin-precipitous enzyme (ACE) by reducing the content of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) by making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as haCE2.
Angiotensin-precipitating enzyme 2 is a cynic-containing metalferment located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N end of the Peptidas domain M2 and the C end-of-transport domain of renaissant amino acid colletrin.
ACE2 is a one-pass membrane protein type I, its enzyme active domain falls on the surface of the cells of light cells and other tissues.
The adage domain ACE2 is broken off by a trans-membranant domain known as fermentation, and the dissolved protein is released into the tissues and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most of the organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most of the alveolar types II cells, the utero cells of the thin intestines, the arterial and venous endothelial cells and the smooth muscle cells of most organs.
ACE2 biosynthesis is also found in the cortex of the brain, the striatum, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counter-balance to ACE.
ACE dilutes the hormone angiotensin I into the vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, dilutes carbon dioxide terminal amino acid phenylanin from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tir-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it in a vaustic angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tir-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also disarm a number of other Peptides, including [des-Arg9] - brodicine, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid SLC6A19 transporter and is present during Hartnup disease.
As a trans-membraced protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coroner viruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-Cov (SARS virus); and SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, linking the S1 protein of the SARS-COV package to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the surface of the cell results in endocytosis and transmission of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosoms located inside the cell.
This inlet process also requires that the S protein be introduced with the serial prosthesis of the TMPRS2 medium, whose inflammation is now being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, leading some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help combat infection.
Nevertheless, many professional communities and regulators recommend the continuation of standard APF and BRA inhalers.
According to a systematic review and metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant 34 per cent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the incidence of pneumonia was also reduced for patients who received APF inhalers who were at higher risk, with pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in the death from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than those of patients with a general risk of pneumonia.”
The recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be an innovation in the treatment of acute lung damage and to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the case of acute respiratory deficiency caused by lipolysaharids.
The period of half-life is about 10 hours for people and the beginning of operation is 30 minutes, in addition to 24 hours.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with the intolerance of classic renin-angiotenzin inhibitors (RAS) or for diseases that raise circulating angiotensin II. The introduced rhACE2 was assessed in clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 annexes are program applications for mobile phones designed to assist in epidemiological investigation in the context of the 2019-20 coroner pandemic, i.e. identification of persons (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many annexes officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options have been developed to track contacts.
This led to a discussion on confidentiality issues, especially those systems that are based on the geographic location of application users.
Softer options include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate the support function of these Bluetooth-based applications directly into their operating systems, Android and iOS.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, has launched an application that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people living with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and Singapore uses an app called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted to the Government, and Northern Macedonia has launched a StopKorona! application, working on Bluetooth, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and ensures operational communication with health authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the application was awaiting registration at Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking application was at the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering the use of annexes based on the Singapore Annex TraceTogether and the BlueTrace protocol, Russia intends to use a geozoning application designed to ensure that patients with COVID-19 diagnostics living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with applications, including false operations and potential inefficiencies in the case of a small proportion of the population.
In view of the concern about the distribution of misleading or harmful Crown applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that may propose their coronavia-related applications to App Store, including only “formal” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also imposed similar restrictions.
The participants in the confidentiality campaign expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through the coronavirus annexes; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronaviour pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such oversight.
The organizations announced eight conditions for public projects:
Monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
The expansion of monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by time-limitation clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the dissemination of COVID-19;
The safety and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such security shall be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as should the right of citizens to respond to abuses;
All relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalized groups, should be “significantly involved”. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Out Biders (RSF) also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the problem of ongoing monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as there is no need to do so.
In some countries, web-based location tracking is used instead of applications, thus avoiding the need to load an application and avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions, which have access to baseline location data, also have major potential confidentiality problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of systems have been developed with confidentiality that are used by central servers only for communications (see below).
In South Korea, a system that did not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special annex, the system collected information on tracking from various sources, including mobile devices and card transactions, and then combined them to generate messages in the form of text messages sent to potential infected persons.
Not only has the Government used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected persons, but it has also made information about the location of the public, which has been made possible because of significant changes in the protection legislation since the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
Tracking contacts where confidentiality is maintained was a well established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dated at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups worked on confidentiality solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized and confidential transport (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identification data never leave the device and that all comparisons occur there.
The Private Group, MIT Media Lab, develops SafePaths, a platform to ensure confidentiality in the collection and use of location or cross-crossing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The platform's work is based on studies in the “Apps Gon Rage: Mainainating Personal Privacy in an Epidemic: How to Maintain Confidentiality During the Epidemic”, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware to allow users to exchange confidential data on location and state of health with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, a global coalition of TCN was founded by groups that share the same approach and use similar protocols, aimed at reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of applications for monitoring and reporting, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official annex.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms announced an initiative to track contacts, which they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography to preserve confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
deployment of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications to monitor the movement of citizens infected by the coronavirus, but with confidentiality of data
In integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve ongoing surveillance problems by introducing the system first by updating the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Reprofiling a drug (also known as re-profiling, re-directing, changing tasks or therapeutic diversion) is re-profiling an approved drug to treat a disease or a medical condition other than that originally prescribed for development.
This is one of the areas of research currently being used to develop safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.
Other research activities include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusing of a re-renaissance plasma. SARS-COV-2 contains some 66 proteins exposed to drugs, each containing several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these connecting areas provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective anti-virus drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-COV-2 are papin-like prosaze, RNA-independent polymerasis, helica, S and ADF-ribophosphase.
Hussain AA and the co-sponsors, in their pre-school study, examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analysed their similarities in structure with the most similar approved drugs in order to expedite the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-COV-2, which would be recommended for clinical research.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four preparations examined under the clinical “Salignity” test.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kumomo, announced that chloroquin and hydroxychloroquine tests would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquin sulphate and chloroquine phosphate in accordance with the emergency authorization for use (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the clinical test process of the FDA and was permitted under the EUA only as a pilot treatment for emergency care for patients who are hospitalized but are unable to receive treatment for clinical test schemes.
CDC stated that “the use, metering or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they're using drugs when there's no other way out.
The Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine, combined with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School in Langon examines the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
China's clinical trials in Uhan and Shenzhen revealed that the paviprovier is “uniquely effective”.
The 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug received negative results on average four days later, while 45 patients who did not take the drug were 11 days long.
In Uhan, a study was carried out in which 240 patients with pneumonia were observed, one half of whom received a paviprovier and the other half received a umiphenoid.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that results that show the effectiveness of the drug were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy a drug in Japan to supplement its stocks, and would use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sinzo Abe informed Trump's administration of the possibility of purchasing a drug, and the drug may be less effective in the cases of disease.
It may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to get pregnant.
One study on the combination of anti-viral drugs, llivander and ritovanir (Caletra) concluded that “no effective use of drugs has been found”.
The drugs have been developed to inflame the spread of HIV by linking to prosthetics.
A team of researchers at Colorado University is trying to modify medicines to find a connection that will be linked to the SARS-COV-2 proteas. In the scientific community, the re-profiling of drugs that have been designed specifically for HIV and AIDS treatment is criticized.
WHO has included a combination of a leopard and a ritovanizer in the international “Harmonity” test.
The remedessir was created and developed by Glead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections and was subsequently found by Glead Sciences to have anti-virus activity in vitro with respect to numerous phylo, pneumo, paramixo and coronaviruses.
One problem related to antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations, which can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remedesir can have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical tests are under way, including two at Cleveland University Hospitals; one at moderate patients and one at more severe patients.
Three clinical trials are under way for internal introduction of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, tests of azithromycin antibiotics began in New York State.
The Japan National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (Cyclésonida) Teijin, an inhalation corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma, with a view to using it as a treatment for presumptive patients infected with the new coronary virus.
Phase II, the form of angiotensin-performing enzyme 2, is tested with the participation of 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who have been hospitalized with severe forms of disease to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of cochicin in reducing inflammation and lung complications for patients with weakly expressed symptoms of COVID-19.
A study called COLOCONA invited 6,000 adults aged 40 or over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 with light symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding and who do not use effective contraceptives cannot participate in the study.
There are several coagulants in Italy.
Non-comocular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which prompted the Italian drug agency to publish recommendations on the use of the drug.
On 14 April, Italy announced a multi-centre study involving 300 patients to study sodium impregnation in preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-COV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on re-profiling approved anti-virus drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and the Western Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Fisheryrin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations.
Umiphenover: Umbiphenoprojekt recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that were considered potentially suitable for use as treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilisumub (Receptor anti-IL-6): Approved in China.
Also in Italy and China, see Tocilizoub#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coroner (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the SARS-COV-2 vaccine would be available earlier than 18 months.
In April, five candidates for vaccines were trained in phase I security studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, resulting in significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-COV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to provide the necessary speed, capacity, deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, 10 different technology platforms were under study and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I security studies:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate drug: Moderna, IRNC-1273)
A virus vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenoviral vector type 5)
According to researchers at CEPI in April, 115 potential vaccines are at an early stage of development, of which 78 are used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milton Institute); in addition, 37 additional vaccine candidates were reported, but little information is available (which is believed to be in the planning or development stage).
During phases I to II, pre-testing for safety and immunity is usually done on randomized, placebo controlled and on several sites with more accurate and effective doses at the same time.
Phase III of the tests usually covers more participants, including the control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for disease prevention effectiveness and side effects are also monitored for optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates under active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on human beings (still in the pre-clinical phase).
On 24 January 2020, Queensland University, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clammy vaccine that genetically modified virus proteins to stimulate immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of Saskatchewan University, Canada, launched work on its own vaccine to begin human testing in 2021.
The vaccination projects were also launched at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies led by Hanneke Schuitmeyker announced the beginning of work on the establishment of their vaccine.
Janssen is working with his biotechnology partner Vaxart to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolvations announced a productive partnership with Vaxart for vaccine development.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine for technology similar to that used for vaccine against cancer neo-antigen.
On 25 March, the head of the Research Institute announced the completion of the vaccine synthesis work and the start of testing.
On 27 February 2020, the subsidiary company Generex, NuGenex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was beginning a project to develop an II-Key Peptide Vaccine v. COVID-19.
Their aim was to develop a drug candidate for a vaccine that could be tested on people in 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Command for Medical Research and Logistics, Fort Detrick, and the Research Institute of the Army, Walter Reed, Silver Spring, located in the western part of Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that she had entered into a partnership with Nevax Inc.
For the development and production of the vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for pre-clinical and clinical testing of phase I by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that even in an accelerated manner it would take at least one and two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Mediaago, a biotechnology company in Québec, reported that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they had created a coronary-like particle.
A potential vaccine is being carried out through laboratory research and human testing is planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that President Donald Trump of the United States had offered CureVac “great sums of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the Government of Germany had protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on IARC.
BNT162 is a candidate for INC vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing pre-clinical testing and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would receive pre-clinical tests in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate could begin testing people in the fall.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced the investment of US$ 4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine consortium with the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Nevax, universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-improvement Vactin RNA from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced $275 million to finance 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medago and Saskatchewan University.
At about the same time, the Canadian Government has announced $192 million specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for a national vaccine bank, which will include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronary.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported on the testing of PittCoVac, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, stating that “MNA has introduced sub-unitary SAS-COV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] that occurred two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA vaccine, which may be produced in the form of nascent spree.
By means of bacteriophysics, DNA will reproduce inside human bacteria and form harmless viral particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-COV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three U.S. universities combined the resources of IBM supercomputers together with the resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud calculations.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can also have other benefits in terms of disease prevention.
Another randomized study conducted in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines developed may not be safe or effective.
Early studies to assess the effectiveness of animal-based vaccines with COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to contain infection with levels of biosecurity 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as for international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines vs. SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there is no drug or protective vaccine for the treatment of ATS that is safe and effective for people.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of asymmetry was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world, and there is no tested vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was considered that the study of ATS, which was conducted at that time, could become a standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic drugs against the infection of MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that had passed phase I of clinical human trials, and three other vaccines, all of which were viral vaccines and were in the process of development, two were adnoviral (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA-vetoral (MVA-MERS-S).
The theory of conspiracy spread on social media, claiming that the COVID-19 virus is not new at all, and that it already exists.
The social media quoted the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents for genetic sequences of other strains of the coronary, such as the SARS coronary, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coroner 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulties.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of self - esteem and stomach pain.
The time from first symptoms to peaks usually ranges from about five days, but may also range from two to fourteen days.
Most cases involve light symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and polyorganic insufficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people were killed by the disease.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, mostly by close contact with one another, often through microscopic droplets released into the air by coughing, tea or conversation.
Although these droplets are formed by exhalation, they usually pose a threat to the ground or on the surface but are not passed through the air at long distances.
People are also infected by touching the contaminated surface and then by their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can be spread both before symptoms appear and at later stages, and the standard diagnostic method is a polymerosed chain reaction with real-time reverse (RT-PCR) in a model taken as a rhino brush.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients suspected of disease and to those who care for them.
Recommendations on the use of masks vary among the population: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
The local spread of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or symptoms of flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and rest.
Emergency symptoms include difficult breathing, constant pain or a feeling of pressure in the chest, lethargic confusion, wake-up difficulties, an increase in the face or lips; if the symptoms listed above are present, medical care should be sought immediately.
There may be less symptoms of upper respiratory disease, such as snorkeling, snout, or throat pain.
There are also different percentages of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Some cases recorded in China were initially shown only by feelings of breast and student heart pressure.
In some cases, the disease can progress by developing in pneumonia, polyorganic insufficiency, resulting in death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period COVID-19 is usually between five and six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, and data indicate that symptoms do not show up for all infected persons.
The role of such unsymptopic carriers in transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence indicates that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected people with unsymptopic disease is currently unknown and is only being studied, with Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20 per cent of confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the virus were unsymptopic.
The National Health Commission of China has begun to include unsymptomized cases in its daily report since 1 April; of the 166 cases recorded on that day, 130 (78 per cent) refused to be symphony at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
When speaking loud, more drops are released into the air than when speaking normal loudness.
A study in Singapore found that when the cough is open, the drop can reach a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission of particles from the virus by bioerosol means is still possible, and testing of air processed by air collectors in corridors outside the rooms of people has revealed the existence of a virus RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as inflammation and cardiovascular resuscitation (SLR), may lead to the spraying of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus can spread through fecals, however, this risk is considered low; the virus is the most secretive when people manifest symptoms; the spread of the virus may be before symptoms occur, but this risk is low.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet fully clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient is usually exposed to 2-3 other people, and that the virus is capable of survival from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface, the virus could live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99 per cent of copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These values, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and cleaning materials used in proper use are quite useful in combating infection: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and can remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalcontychloride and chlorhexyde glucose (hyurgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus, and in a study carried out in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
Five out of six patients had the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and the highest levels of the virus in the blood had been detected on the second day of testing.
Heavy acute respiratory coroner syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new heavy and acute coronary respiratory syndrome, first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-COV-2 virus are also found in the coronaviruses of nature.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens its protective shell.
The light is the organ most affected by COVID-19, as the virus enters the master cell through angiotensin turning enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in types II alveolar cells.
The virus is attached to ACE2 and enters the master cell by means of a characteristic glycoprotein, “chip” (peplomer).
Twelve per cent of the infected persons admitted to the hospital in Uhana were diagnosed with severe myocardial injuries, which are more common in the severe form of disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to a system-wide inflammatory response and immune system disturbances during the progress of the disease, but the severe damage to myocardials can also be due to the availability of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are in large numbers in the heart as they participate in the work of this body.
The high frequency of trombozzes (31 per cent) and venous tromboembola (25 per cent) were observed by patients in ITL with COVID-19 and may indicate adverse projections. Autology of patients killed by COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar injuries (DAD) and lymphocytes containing inflammable inflammatory inhalers in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressive airway cells, patients with heavy COVID-19 have symptoms of system hyper-inflammation.
In particular, it was found that the pathogenic GM-CF T-cells were correlationd with the propagation of inflammatory monocities that secreted IL-6 and heavy lung pathology from patients with COVID-19.
Limphocitarian inflation was also detected at the opening.
WHO has also published several test protocols for this disease.
The real-time half-time chain response (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test shall normally be carried out on respiratory samples obtained from the rhino brush, but a sample of nose or wet brush may also be used.
The results are usually produced for a period of between several hours and two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples, taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are of no direct importance.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify a strain of coroner and publish a genetic sequence so that laboratory scientists around the world can develop their own polymeroses chain response tests (PCRs) to detect the presence of this virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests that could detect infection at the current time, as well as possible contamination in the past, were under development but had not yet been widely available.
China ' s experience with the test results showed that they were only 60-70 per cent accurate.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Office (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, authorizing its use at the end of this month. The diagnosis instructions issued by Zhangan Khuhan University Hospital indicate how to detect infection on the basis of clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral, multi-dimensional sub-plenary circuits of the type of “matular glass” with the peripheral, asymmetrical and apostoric distribution are frequent symptoms identified at an early stage of the disease.
Sub-plastic dominance, symptoms of a buoyant bridge (long-lasting of a partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic damage and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
Main results of a pathological study carried out at the time of the opening:
Macroscopy: Pplevirit, pericarditis, sealing, and bilges
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
light pneumatic fluids: eye cells, hyperplasia of pneumatic cells, major a priori pneumatic cells, interstic inflammation with lymphatic inflation and the formation of multinuclear giant cells
Heavy form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exud.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (RSD) and severe hypoxemia.
Surviving pneumonia: organization of excussors in alveolar floors and light intersisting fibrosis.
Blood: Diffuse intravascular detachment (VAN-syndrome); leukarybroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include stay at home, avoiding public places, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observance of respiratory hygiene, and avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mercury by unwashed hands.
CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a salphet in a cough or schillery or, in the absence of a napkin, the mouth and nose be covered with the inner side of the arm area.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a good hygiene procedure be conducted for the hands.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue masks in public places, in particular in order to limit transmission of infection by persons with symphony, social distance strategies aimed at reducing contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and businesses, limited movement of citizens and the cancellation of major public activities.
The recommendations for distance also imply that people must be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
No proven effectiveness drugs exist against COVID-19 since the completion of the vaccine is expected to take place no earlier than 2021, most of the measures against COVID-19 are to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as “plate exit”.
CDC also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hand pollution, and before and after eating, coughing or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant alcohol-containing (at least 60 per cent alcohol content) hand-processing equipment, but only when soap and water are not available. Where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two receptors for local production.
These compositions use ethanol or isopropanol, which is anti-microgen activity.
Hydrogen transfer is used to resolve a bacterial alcohol dispute and is not a suitable tool for antiseptic hand handling.
Glyerolle is added as a damper.
Patients are shown support therapy, which may include infection therapy, oxygen support, as well as support for other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they are infected with the virus wear a normal medical mask.
Extra-corporated membrane oxygen (ECMO) was used to address respiratory deficiency, but its benefits are still being explored.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended that the rules of personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diet be respected.
Supportive therapy can be shown to patients with mild symptoms at the early stages of the disease, WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive therapy doctors and pulmonologists summarized the medical recommendations of the various institutions in a free resource — IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 was available.
In order to treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health professionals recommend choosing paracetamole (accetaminophen) as compared to ibuprophene.
In carrying out procedures in which air caps, such as injection or hand drying, may occur, caution needs to be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities.
CDC recommends that medical personnel caring for persons with COVID-19 be placed in AIIR, an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. CDC published recommendations on the use of personal protection (ICD) during the pandemic.
The recommended personal protection equipment is a protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves, and it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks from the above means.
N95 respirators were approved for industrial use, but FDA authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but for use without instructions, protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of protective front screens or, as a matter of last resort, the manufacture of masks on their own in home conditions.
In most cases, COVID-19 is not too heavy to require artificial ventilation of or alternative to lungs, but there is also a percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory problems associated with COVID-19 is under active consideration, and there is some evidence that injections can be avoided by means of a nose oxygen can with heavy air flow or two levels of positive air pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods are as effective for patients in critical condition as IWL.
Some doctors choose invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs if available, since this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to high air current nasals; the risk of a severe form of disease for older persons (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
Many developed countries lack per capita hospital beds, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in heavy forms requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 eventually fall into resuscitation.
The task of artificial ventilation of the lungs is becoming more complex, as acute respiratory distributive syndrome (ARDS), which develops during COVID-19, and oxygenation has become increasingly problematic.
IWL, supported by inhalation pressure and PCR, is necessary to deliver a maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure a minimum damage to ventilation, which may result in the development of pneumotrox.
In earlier fan models, high PCRs may not be available.
Research on potential treatment began in January 2020 and several anti-virus drugs are currently being tested.
The prospector is the most promising.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested for patients with severe forms of disease.
Volunteers recommended by WHO participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. FDA granted temporary authorization to use re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-survect plasma as a pilot treatment in cases where a person ' s life is in danger of serious or immediate danger.
Its use was not subject to clinical research to prove the safety and effectiveness of treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat the outbreak.
Users must enter their name and identification number for entry.
The annex may detect “near contact” by means of observation data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also verify the status of the other three users.
When the potential risk is detected, the annex not only recommends self-inseparation but also sends notification to local health authorities. Large data collected from mobile phones, identification technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and persons they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to monitor the mobile telephones of people suspected of being infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to provide quarantine and protection for persons who may contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, the Federal Government Institutions of Germany and the Robert Koch Institute have provided aggregate data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, a facial recognition technology has been introduced to identify quarantine violators.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, reported that cellular operators reported that “40 per cent of people still move within the territory”.
The Government of Germany has conducted a 48-hour holiday programming marathon, in which more than 42,000 participants participated.
The President of Estonia, Kersty Kaluleid, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronaviour.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Enhancing social exclusion, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming people's mental health and well-being”.
Diseases can occur in light form with minor or missing symptoms that resemble other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common cold.
Patients with a mild form of disease are usually cured for two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may need to be treated for three to six weeks.
Women who are pregnant may be at higher risk of obtaining a heavy form of COVID-19 based on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although such data for COVID-19 are not available.
Those with the most severe period of COVID-19 may rapidly progress into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) resulting in respiratory deficiency, septic shock or polyorganic deficiency.
The complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, anomalous trombo-education, and heart, kidney and liver problems.
Trombo-education abnormalities, especially the increase in protrommonium time, were reported by 6 per cent of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while the kidney function is broken by 4 per cent of this group.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have liver enzymes (transaminas).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and deaths was ten days, five of which were for hospitalization.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to intensive care was seven days.
Early studies show that the average time from the initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 per cent and for women 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem lung samples reveal a diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromixoid exsidants in both lungs.
The pneumatic cells have seen viral cytopatic changes.
The appearance of the light was similar to the acute respiratory syndrome (ODS).
In 11.8 per cent of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were related to the rise of troponin or heart arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the availability of health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary according to conditions due to regional differences, as well as methodological difficulties.
Insufficiently effective calculation of cases in light form may lead to over-death.
Nevertheless, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smoking users developed a total of 1.4 times more severe symptoms of COVID-19 and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die than non-smokers, and concerns were expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
The Hong Kong clinic authorities found that some patients who had recovered from the disease had experienced a 20-30 per cent reduction in their lungs and that their scans had revealed injuries.
After recovery, this may also lead to the “Intensive Treatment after Intensive Treatment” syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether survivors of the virus had a permanent immunity against them.
Based on the currents of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but cases were also reported where, after recovery from COVID-19, the coronavirus tests were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an exacerbation of the disease rather than a reoccupation.
The virus is believed to be natural, animal-born and infectious.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, refers to 1 December 2019 as the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, the date is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to measure mortality.
All figures vary according to the region and the time of the spread of the disease, and are also affected by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time from the outbreak of the disease and the population parameters, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency codes for ICD-10:U07.1 for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-COV-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of the disease, SARS-COV-2. The ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a certain period of time.
As of 17 April 2020, according to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153,822/2 240).
This figure varies from region to region, and some other methods include the definition of the death rate due to disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, as well as the definition of the death rate as a result of transferred infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced by all patients suffering from infection, the presence of these antibodies can be understood as how many people have been infected.
At the outbreak center in Italy, Castillone d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Guangelte, the disease was spread to young people during the celebration, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies based on donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (00.04 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates vary for men and women.
According to research conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The highest-risk group was men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women had been reduced only since the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioural.
Gender immunological differences, the lower prevalence of smoking among women associated with diseases among men (e.g. hypertension experienced by men at a younger age than women) can lead to higher mortality rates among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of those infected were men, and 72 per cent of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government did not maintain gender statistics for COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and ORVI have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, more likely to become infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially named COVID-19.
The director of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebraius, explains: “CO” means “Korona”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease” and “19” when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid reference to a particular geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international name recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coroner-respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus”.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the crown.
During the initial outbreak in Uhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the “Koronavirus” and the “Konak Crown virus”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical sites in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “high respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCOV” as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, the official names “COVID-19” and “SARS-COV-2” were published.
Due to limitations on the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials, such as nasal pumps, as well as parts of IWL ' s machines.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time, and one of the local productions was re-profiled and was able to print the required 100 valves overnight.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, various theories of conspiracy, disinformation and fairy tales regarding the origin of the virus, its scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects have been spread at high speed on the Internet.
Humans are likely to become infected with other animals.
Research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine for the virus or drugs for its treatment.
Various international research on vaccines and drugs from COVID-19 is currently under way by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated SOLIDARITY Trial, the aim of which is to assess the medical impact of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
A vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing candidate drugs for the vaccine.
Both the SARS-COV and the SARS-COV-2 enter human cells with the ACE2 receptor, so scientific research uses the results of previous studies carried out under the SARS-COV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers seek to create a whole-of-viron vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the establishment of a subsidial vaccine, aims at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, such research is aimed at destroying the S-schilled protein, which helps the virus enter the receptor of the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is to develop vaccines based on nucleinic acids (DNA or RNA vaccin, a new vaccine approach).
The experimental vaccines developed for any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, Seattle started the first clinical test of the vaccine on four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code from the virus that causes the disease, and the anti-téthelassed increase was identified as a potential problem in the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests were being carried out.
The drugs approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven tests, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The re-profiling of anti-virals is a major part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III studies on remedesir were conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and drug candidates for COVID-19 was carried out. Several other existing antivirals for COVID-19 treatment were also being considered, including remededesir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, thopillaviar / rytonaviar, and rythonaular / rythonaure, combined with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, preliminary data were available on the effectiveness of the use of the remedesir.
A clinical improvement was observed in patients who received remedessir as an exception.
The use of chloroquine previously used for malaria treatment was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results were available.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Uhan Institute of Virus Science recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling the dose is very dangerous and can lead to fatal consequences.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued a permit for the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients from COVID-19. The 7th edition of China also listed interferon, fisherin or emphyseminator as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of fisherium are necessary to inflame SAS-COV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for detailed study in vivo by demonstrating the inflammation of ATS-COV-2 at low concentrations, and studies have shown that for the penetration of SARS-COV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptor, it is necessary to apply the protein of trans-membraced prosthesis 2 (TMPRSS2).
Research into the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study.
Hypercyctokinemia may arise as complications at later stages of the heavy form COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytocytamine properties, and a small study by the National Health Commission of China included tocilysumubs in the recommendations for the treatment of coronerium.
The drug reached a stage 2 of an unannounced test, which was conducted at the national level in Italy, after the positive results of its use were obtained from patients with a severe form of disease.
In combination with a blood serum analysis of the ferritin to detect cytocin storms, it is designed to counter factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA was approved by an antagonist of the receptor interlecine-6 based on retrospective case studies to treat steroid refracter cyctocin syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there has been no randomized and controlled evidence that the tocilysumub is an effective means of treating cytoxin syndrome.
The transmission of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by immunized systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is now seen as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
The strategy had been tried in the treatment of the patients of the SARS, but its results had not been convincing.
The neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-COV-2.
However, it is possible to use other mechanisms, such as anti-teletoxic cytotoxicity and/or phagocyteosis.
Other forms of passive antitele therapy, such as monolonic antibodies, are under development.
The use of renaissance serum, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of patients who have been cured and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.
Coronary diseases, high-level group of syndromes
Lee Wenlan, a doctor at the central clinic of Uhanha, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
