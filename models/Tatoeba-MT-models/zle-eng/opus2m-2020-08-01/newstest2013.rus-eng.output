Republic strategy for resistance to the re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justified their policy of fighting falsification in elections.
However, in Brennan Centre, the last myth is considered to be the last one, claiming that cases of falsification in elections in the United States are more rare than cases of lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers have only counted 300 cases of electoral falsification in the United States in a decade.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state Governments have enacted laws since 2009 that have made registration or voting more difficult.
This phenomenon gained new momentum following the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were passed in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require an elector to produce a photo and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the voter ' s right to register on the day of expression and withdraw the right to vote from citizens having a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no United States State had obliged voters to present a photo identity card.
Indiana became the first state to impose a similar requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian Act.
The Republic authorities have been in a hurry to extend this practice to other states.
During the past two years, they have initiated draft laws that require voters to present their identity cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, or 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have a personal identity card with a photograph issued by their state government authority.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
However, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African-Americans, 15 per cent of people making less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required identity card.
But that's not all.
Voter students who are believed to vote for candidates from democracies are not allowed in several states to use the identity card with a photograph issued by their educational institution.
At the same time, the same states allow fishing and hunting clubs, which vote mainly for Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state had requested proof of American citizenship for voting.
For the first time, a similar requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are apparently intended to limit the vote of Latin Americans.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, republican legislators introduced laws in 2011 to abolish voter registration on the day of voting in eight states.
They have also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
The restriction did not go without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the early voters were African-Americans, although the latter represented only 13 per cent of the state-wide voters.
The same had happened to Latin Americans.
Only 11 per cent of voters represented 24 per cent of the citizens who had voted earlier.
Unlike whites, which formed 76 per cent of voters, only 46 per cent of voters were early voters.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the enactment of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws have been enacted by democratic governors.
The most controversial laws have been suspended with the intervention of the United States Prosecutor General.
This made it possible to limit in part the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have enacted laws requiring the production of a photo identity card.
Nevertheless, the new rules that have entered into force would undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics from the democracies condemn the bias of the laws that have been enacted with a clear focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The Brennan centre report of 2011 shows that the States that have enacted these laws represent 171 out of the 270 votes required by the panel of electors to win the presidential elections.
It is too early to argue with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Precise cancer screening: pass test or not?
In fact, the PAS test sometimes produces false, false, and sometimes false, which leads to useless medical interventions.
Men, and men who are so reluctant to go through a dispersal, have more to doubt.
Pass a test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
Studies in the United States have seen numerous cases of infection among groups of researchers, so it is difficult to interpret the data and it is difficult to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time by Europeans, found different rates of mortality for patients who had undergone screening and those who had not.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastasis is 30 to 40 per cent higher for those who have not received screening.
So I'd recommend a 50-year test, or 40 if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at high risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is found.
Cancer can be both aggressive and powerful.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering him options, without mandatory treatment for Prostate Cancer, which does not pose a risk to life in the long run, but chooses to actively monitor the disease in these cases.
To date, many men exposed to cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is neither aggressive nor life threatening.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
More and more often, we define with precision the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
So I'd recommend that we do the test.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether this test is necessary or not.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movumber has developed a tool to evaluate all of the PSA tests for and against them.

Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, living a healthy life remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
Thirty percent of cases of cancer are thought to be preventable if all people were to eat well and move sufficiently.
"If no one else smokes, this figure would have increased to at least 50%," says André Bollet, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cases of cancer are due to inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancers.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It is causing enormous harm to people’s health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says Spokesperson André Bolier.
An encouraging fact is that 10 years after refusing to smoke, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Central African Republic, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat and direct intestines, food supplies, pancreas, and uterine.
"Research shows that regular physical activity over the course of life protects against cancer intestines," is added to the Association.
Food
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too many quantities, it increases the risk of cancer from a fat intestine.
Colosseum products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by digging, drying or salt may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter may harm the cells of the body and lead to cancer development," explained in the Association.
Vitamines
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But to date, the results of these studies are not clear.
In the view of SCC, vitamin E research has yielded contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other did the opposite.
The assessment of the impact of vitamin D cancer also lacks full clarity.
However, he stressed that it was important to discuss its concerns and family anamones with the doctor.
"Discipline doesn't lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson in Details
In the past summer, reports that scientists may have been able to detect Higgs' boson have caused real effigy -- and not without reason.
This boson is believed to explain the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, it is the last particle predicted by the Standard Model, our best, or, in any case, the “less imperfect” description of nature and conduct of matter, but which was previously not detected in an experienced way.
But physics is not yet fully convinced that this is the Higgs Boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it is very much like the Higgs Boson, predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at one major physical convention in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
Let's imagine what it's about the Higgs Boson, because the chances of making mistakes seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is one law in this world that is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things can't be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, even if you do not try too hard, or hurt yourself.
But while elementary particle physics is a rather strange world, it also appears to have one law of a similar nature: the principle of the exclusion of Paulie, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same “quant state”, is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Therefore, physics divides particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good - mannered citizens called farms, who wisely conform to Paulie’s principle.
In another case, there are bosons, an vile gang of anarchists who have no respect for any of these principles, which means that they may be at the same place at the same time.
As reported by the site (by contrast, unusual) Particular Adventure, the Burkley Laboratory, these bosons are divided into two groups: the mezons we're not talking about here, and the “parts of force” through which the major forces of nature are extended and which are of some sort the Higgs Boson.
These very bosons, it should be stressed, are not all the exotic creatures that could be thought of.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: photon, or part of the light, which is the "sourier" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes its direction, it breaks the electromagnetic field at this particular location, roughly like a stone thrown into a pond.
It produces an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and it is nothing more than photon, and thus one of the bosons of "power carriers".
A more stable field
The same is true of Higgs' Boson, with the difference that for this boson to appear must be "breaked" by another field, by Higgs' field.
The Higgs field, however, is much more stable than an electromagnetic field; it requires very and very high energy to stimulate it, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface could shake only a very large stone.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator like the one that's being exploited in CERN, the Grand Adronsky Collider, which is a 27 km diameter ring!
An analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between Higgs Boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never be held in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (as photon, by the way) do not.
So, what can all of these studies do, please, ask Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to check the correctness of the Standard Model (CM), and this also makes it possible for physicists to find a difference between the results of SM observations and projections.
In addition, some of them long for such a discrepancy to be found, as the smallest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and close some of the holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant flaws without any explanation for gravity or for Dark Matter, which forms about 80% of the universe.
But so far there's no such difference in CERN.
Effects
It would be more difficult to predict from these studies for the average person’s day - to - day life, but it would be a mistake to assume that he is not.
See, early in the 1960s, the pioneers of laser research at Bella's labs could not even predict what revolution their work would be called upon to do.
They've seen their applications in science, but no more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in Bell Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960 and who himself developed the first continuous laser (former) in 1962, said that originally a laser was viewed as a “laboratory device”.
Imagine...
In addition, an annex may be available for the tools accompanying the study.
For example, the same Billion Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical research in 1969.
This sensor, although not originally designed, now serves as a "gloss" for all digital cameras in the world and deserves the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physics.
This does not mean, of course, that the work of the Greater Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
The palliative aid is the best way to die... .. "Dolgue."
The Québec Commission recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume soon and a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
Dolg tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montreal.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed him from within, gave him two years to delay.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in the bed at Victor Hadbaa's palliative care shelter in Beloy, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't prepare for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet and even eating your own food.
As he sits at a table with an appetizing meal, he surrenders and agrees to be helped to receive food.
He is alert, even smiling, talking to strangers who work around him, bring him medication, and take him to the bathroom.
Courage before the normal death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"We've been taught over the course of our lives that a man has to urinate," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Hadbaa's shelter.
Regress to the condition of the child - for some, undying humiliation.
"Everybody depends on the ability of man" to accept failure, he claims.
Because, according to many palliative care workers, important developments are also taking place at the height of this decline.
Patients entering Victor Hadboa palliative shelter are all suffering from cancer.
Projections give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more assistance called “medical”.
Ms. A., 89 years old, most afraid of dying "in consciousness from suffocation."
But the disease enabled me to get to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in my life," she says, before I let her have a mask that makes breathing easier.
She is still awaiting her son's visit from Italy in the next few days.
A group of volunteers provide body care and nutrition assistance at the Victor Hadboa shelter.
This is a palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, every 11,700 inhabitants have one place in palliative care facilities.
That's very little, given that sooner or later we're all gonna die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, as explained by Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or emotional comfort.
The dying one will agree to give mouth strips of brandy or poppies, whatever he asks.
We don't force diabetes to control sugar levels anymore.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H. who died tonight.
In the morning, his son drank that beer in his legs at the late man.
"We're helping loved ones, as well as patients," says Natalie Sawar, director of care for the sick.
There's no previous day at Victor Hadboa's shelter.
Close to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, resting on his pillows in his honor, tragically dies a young man 36 years old, surrounded by parents, wife and two young children, and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, between three and five beds, always occupied by cancer patients under 45," Dr. Christian Martel is concerned.
53 per cent of patients admitted to the Victor Hadbaa shelter came from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
77 per cent of Canadians are considered simply to have no access to palliative care, i.e. care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stages of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Hadbaa's shelter and the Society for palliative care at the House of the Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this great gap in Quebec’s health system that causes many palliative doctors to fear the adoption of a law legitimizing euthanasia and helping with suicide.
Since October, there has been a manifesto on palliative care, Dr. Balfour Maunt and Dr. Bernard Lapute, indicating their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she said, “I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many Oncologists have been trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
Ellen Richard's survival hopes were minimal when she stopped chemotherapy.
When I told my cologne that I was about to stop treatment, she said that she regretted that I was going to stop fighting, ” she says.
She told me that my days were numbered!
No comprehensive care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of those who ask for death are thanks to the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not entirely comprehensive in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Society of palliative care at the House of the Greater Montreal, patients are not vulnerable to an 8 percent disease.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to a palliative session in which the patient sleeps until he dies, either from time to time or permanently.
We cannot pretend anymore that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more, patients who are unable to relieve their pain will be able to have access to a palliative session.
The pain patients always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to have euthanasia," which means "I want to get easier."
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute for Health Studies of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political party raisers and experts in the Italian Mafia daily tell what they know about the vast “system” that misleads the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafia.
The “Industry”, which was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how this system ends up after all the money has been set in motion, "Jacques Ducheno, deputy and former chief of police in Montreal"
It was thanks to him that, in 2011, he had suffered a scandal as a result of an investigation into official offences related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of the time from liberals, Jean Share, had agreed very reluctantly.
The Ducheno Report established a direct link between industry, the covert financing of political parties and corruption.
“From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stresses, the Ministry of Transport alone would have retained billions of dollars on contracts” if some had held back their instincts.
The Charbonno Commission had already moved two mayors, and he hoped that it would be able to “discover the schemes behind the individual”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, was joined by a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the staff of the Molot Special Unit, who, after 2009, had forced Montreal's “smart cartel”, to cease over-valued contracts.
A series of searches had been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotto, mayor of a small town, had been charged with fraud and corruption.
In line is Housing Weiangkur, who recently resigned from the position of Mayor of Lavala, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of receiving bribes on several occasions when public orders are made.
In addition, several transport engineers from Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin were formally charged, including Tony Aktouro and Lino Zambit.
The latter blew up a real bomb, following an investigation into a “system” of government contracts.
For several years, Zambit paid 3 per cent of the value of the contracts entered into in Montreal to a mob broker who, in turn, had transferred the money of the Mayor of Gerald Trambreal's party, United Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambit lost his money to the right and left and listed over $88,000 (about Euro88,000) to various provincial parties, mostly the liberals who were then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he had illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberian Party, Natalie Normando.
Sewerage contracts in which the value of the goods was overstated
In Montreal, the corruption system worked unreservedly.
Surprenann’s residence, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the Commission: within ten years, he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tours, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts, the value of which he overstated.
Other officials responsible for road construction admitted that they had received 30 to 40 per cent in excess of the accounts through false additions.
One mayor, Martan Dumont, then accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party's cash with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremble resigned early in November, placing Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to be alarmed.
Rivier de Prery County Mayor in the east of the island, she has opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal property purchased for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a building boom.
70% of dirty money in pre-election campaigns
She said that, in the investigation that would eventually begin, she would “scramble a thread to understand the functioning of an ant in order to stop the gangrene and identify the perpetrators”.
This process is characterized as “a painful but positive one”.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid returning questionable practices.
How we go home.
Regularly.
Jacques Ducheno notes on his part that “the perpetrators stole hundreds of millions of dollars” but is particularly concerned about the role of “electional officials who knew about the scheme” but who did not participate in the frauds.
Given that the proportion of dirty money in financing the electoral campaign in Quebec is up to 70 per cent, he jokes, "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Québec proposes to limit up to $100 to parties, but he says that this will not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit election costs, we will have dirty money in politics.”
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of awarding public contracts and party financing: “We cannot go down; we will be able to build a house on a solider foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Ducheno calls on those who laugh to look into their own yard...
"PSW is not Barcelona's FC!"
At this season, you've made an unusual amount of money at the SWW.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but it may also be by a new dimension of SWD.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
It's all happening very fast in football.
But I'm not falling apart.
From the beginning, at the pre-training centre at the NIF in Clerphonten and before my arrival in St. Estienne, I always stepped forward.
So you're benefiting from the competition set up by Carlo Anchelotti...
It's not about playing very high-level matches.
They also know that each training is important.
This means that a player like me wants to be at the same level and be put to the top of it.
In addition, Carlo Anchotti is supporting my positioning.
He's helped by alternates like Claude Macele, who played in the same position as I did.
Aneclottis is the master of the situation?
Of course.
The Ancelots inspire respect for all technical personnel.
Today he is not equal in the First League and is among the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I've been walking away from a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the TV season?
In the First League, Lyon took our leader's seat.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is the League of Champions: we have effectively qualified ourselves as one eighth of the final.
What's the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try as far as we can.
From now on, everything can be.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to accept a counter match in one eighth of the final.
Will the WWF be able to become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris must win titles and consolidate positions for the long term.
That's not true today.
Financially, PAW has the means to make this project real.
Do not take title in the First League, how will last season be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to get this championship title.
We were close to this last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had everything to come to the finish line first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points imply the rank of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it'll be all right.
Despite the fact that strong teams such as Marcel, Lyon and Bordeaux have taken part in the struggle for title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media are waiting too much for PWD?
It's normal to expect a lot of things from us, considering how much money has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We are fully prepared to do so.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua at home and we're still found to be critical of something, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We ask ourselves, ‘ What do people expect of us first? ’
We can never win every weekend with a 4-0 account.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a project game.
The team is formed over time.
We've proved in the League of Champions that we can meet today's challenges.
Look at Manchester U.S.A., who has been unable to enter one eighth of the final two seasons, although they have also spent a lot of money!
Given the amounts invested, we represented you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
That would be disregard for our opponents and French championship.
Lyons and Marseilles, which were not high in the last season, were “resurrected” by this new TFG.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The U.S.W. seems to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, if they say there's some kind of "Slave of dependence."
It just means that Ibrahimović is very successful and that he kills a lot of heads.
He came for it, and he proves that he is the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a global star.
In the group, we respect him as a human and a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with France assembled?
That's disappointing.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from wasting some time playing.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out of there stronger.
Today, I'm able to play a good match.
That's what I've hoped for since I was baptized with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine and should now be exemplary.
What do you think of Didier Deschama's first months under the head of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He has good positions in the selection team for the peace championship.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players and inspires him to win.
What Laurent Blanc was like.
But I don't want to compare.
Blance has achieved his goal, he has qualified us as Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamp will lead the Blue One to Brazil.
A well-deserved nobody (1-1) torn out on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, my career didn't have a match like that.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Betcoin
The full contrast to the current cash exchange based on centrifuges, numbered transactions between receiving parties with fees for processing them.
Moreover, as often happens to these technologies, the political vision is obvious: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolyes, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (psychonodium), is also a virtual currency (alternated into dollars, euros ...) and a protected protocol of exchange by type BitTorrent, which allows file exchanges to take place between participants at the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand sites receive bitumen for donations or as a payment.
By reaching a maximum of $30 (Euro23) in June 2011, the bitkin rate fell to $2 five months later before returning to about ten dollars today (the course is shown on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this system in its report on virtual currency published in October.
He describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “concursing with a dollar or euro” and “like ordinary currencies”.
The bitumen differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to advance video games that are earned or can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
Facebook Social Network has also developed such a system.
But exchange transactions always control and process a central authority.
In Bitcean, all network nodes are both book holders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, like an e-mail address.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is electronically signed using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitumen used in the transaction does exist in a public ledger distributed over the entire network.
A key step is the registration of a new transaction in the book.
It goes through a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
This is the hashing phase of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers take a new transaction and add a number to it before "healing" all together.
The aim is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction thus appears to be inseparably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for purposes of deception, the user would like to pay twice as fast (less than 10 minutes) and the subject money twice, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network and the other would remain unconfirmed because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitoons.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize is regularly shared in half by the end of 2012.
So the number of bitumens in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they're divided to one hundred million, which leaves another reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing capacity.
The network has already experienced take-offs and fall.
Bitcoin service sites were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
“The defect used is not related to the protocol itself”, assures Pierre Nouza, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, are allowed.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel recently analysed the book account and found that almost 80 per cent of the batons were not in circulation.
The giant sales were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmkwist, who works for Coinabul, who is in the process of converting bitumen into gold.
Pierre Nouza, another author of this currency's allowance, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a non-continuous payment through a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which is thus cheaper.
The owner has better control of his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It's enough just to tell you the address you can take a picture and recognize by telephone, telling Pierre Noise that he's already got thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to review hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"There will be some time before the Betcoin stands, but 2013 can be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, implies, by the way, a review of the various risks considered to be raised today should the system succeed.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French forces have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capius and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future without hoping for us alone.
We have suffered mainly from Afghan peasants, whom we considered to be terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed and wounded and wounded.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even though they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are being tolerated, sometimes assisted by local rebels, but they will be gone as soon as the West is more sensitive.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills of the almond trees, thanks to French loans, was fine.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban attacks on Kabul.
The circumstances have changed from the time of their unconquerable progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the country was in the fire and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the snowstorming of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved in our time.
The former Mojajedas, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to retain women in subordination.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become detachers of state land to resold them to repatriate returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan using huge American subcontracts.
They were discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I've heard in rural areas, want a government that's not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as do those who have made American generosity: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They lived in a modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they assessed its benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
State schools in cities are filled with boys and girls alike.
There is a need to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the old parties or corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed fighters, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the world today, and which look everywhere.
There is an army at the moment.
The authorities that will command it, will they be considered legitimate?
The old commanders who waged anti-Soviet struggles are already in the process of re-establishing provincial wives who are not subject to central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to a degree, as was the case with Western countries, but the United States wanted to make it a centralized State with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, even before, depended on foreign aid.
Industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruit.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by the thirty years of war, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
This only increased the feeling that Western countries were present only to take possession of them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transportation to export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Messa Inak mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also essential that Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, restore normal relations one day equally.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: girls ' lynchings, boys ' faces, French-language faculties at university, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and support for an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “consolidate hearts and minds” and carry out the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the Military Civil Activities Service of the Ministry of Defence (Cymic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French social organization, has contributed to numerous social and agricultural activities in dozens of mountain villages.
These efforts, with the active involvement of local workers, have helped to contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, protection of soils and expansion of croplands.
What will we remember by spending two billion euros on military expenditures?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural works from local communities in the province of Capina.
In order to rid themselves of the rebellions led by foreign groups, which farmers, as they told me, require a little non-military support that is well controlled and direct to them.
Heavy kinds of Egyptian Constitution
This is a new venture by President Mohammed Murcy.
While Egypt was more than ever divided on the question of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, it decided to play the wa-bank.
He announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
For two years soon, Egypt had relied on a preliminary text, which had been amended several times, which had weakened institutional stability and led to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only increased the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic”, continuing “to violate the word” and “to challenge the right”.
In the camp, his followers were confident that it was a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that causes Bratiev to abandon his intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, article by article.
It is also a way for the President to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is buffeting throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsey seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in one interview to the American weekly Time.
In particular, the call for an accelerated vote is based on the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: “Either you vote in favour of my text or I leave my extraordinary powers”, which is expected to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday in favour of the text.
Most liberals did not respond.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they jerked through the door, feeling unable to convey their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to achieve the required quorum, 11 persons, spare participants, were promptly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is no wonder that in most cases the articles were voted out unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, have been confused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day has arisen around... time for prayer, as some committee members have felt that the Constituent Assembly's hours were not well organized.
The text on which there was still a vote yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The object of general attention, article 2 ultimately remained the same article from the 1971 Constitution, which stated that “the principles of the Sharia are the principal source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law was a fundamental requirement, had hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would make it possible to apply them more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Licmerie," the liberals who only see it as a pyar.
Because, in their view, Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They point particularly to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of the conformity of Shariah laws.
According to Egypt’s expert, Sofia Pomie, this is alarming: “people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected or have any democratic legitimacy”.
We can see the beginning of the theocracy."
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next Rector of this university appears to be much less moderate than the current one.
"There is no specific religious interference at present.
With this constitution we remain under civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ultimatums, but university students, some have studied in the French system,” calms Alexis Bloe, who prepares a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that “the scope of article 220 may be ambiguous, since the terms used therein are drawn from religious lexicon.
This applies in particular to "fix" [Islamic jurisprudence - prima facie].
A question may arise in the future as to how competent civil judges are to rule on this matter.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized as it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claimed that they had been significantly reduced from what they had been under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the authority of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will be reviewed not by Parliament but by the National Defence Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests by human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text which they considered to be destructive to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy was maintained, and insults were now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Furthermore, none of the articles any longer speak of the protection of women, stresses Heba Moreef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the prohibition of torture in article 36 was the only positive development.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State, in turn, will go to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, Pupp Earth and Sea from the Lobster
The land promised combines within it the greatness of Bible truths, modern comforts, and the primacy of nature.
AIF identified five of the most important reasons to be present in Israel.
Worship Holy Places
The Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized, is worth a visit.
It is believed that God’s grace is upon all who enter this “buy. ”
And Galileo is the place of Jesus ’ miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming the storm, and filling the networks.
Here Jesus appeared before his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most of all the shrines in Jerusalem.
The believers here are on the Skorbie Pathway or the Cross Pathway of Jesus (in Latin, Vía Doroza).
It begins at the stronghold of Antonia Pretoria, where there was a trial, and in the streets of the Old City, it brings in the Temple of the Lord on Mount Golgotha, the place of Resumption, the Stone of Anointed One, and the burial place of Jesus.
Here, too, is the symbolic Christian Pupp of the earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be built on a place where Christian legend describes a tree from which it was made for Jesus ’ crucifixion.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jews, Stan Placus, left behind by the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of various confessions leave notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Make a Vertical Travel
Massad’s ruins remained a secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on highlands in the mountains at a height of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who engage in alpine activity can reach them.
The others on this historic summit are carrying the lift on the rope road.
In the northern part of the country, a famous mountain ski resort, Hermon, is located at an altitude of 1,600 to 2040 metres, with a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A bus shuttle is delivering to him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the mining track is 45 km.
In ancient tradition, pagan gods were said to have lived on top of the mountain.
Visit Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don't visit everyone for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (Parliament).
It stores the ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Jewish desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
Also worth visiting the Arts Museum in Tel Aviv.
His exhibition is based on the impressionist and expressionist paintings of Mone, Pissaro, Renoir, Cezanne, Silei, Matisse, Modileyan, Chagala and Picasso.
It is possible to visit the Al Basha Museum in Accra, which is a number of old Turkish baths containing visitors and bankers of the time.
In Cesaria, we should visit the unique private museum of Rally, where we can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Rodden.
There are no tour guides and gift benches.
The entrance is free, and donations are not categorically accepted.
Fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Jad Yours in Tel Aviv -- one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the Children ' s Memorial, is built to commemorate 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it and you end up in perfect darkness.
The stars are coming together.
The names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Healing Up
The three main resort zones of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each has pools, aqua Parks, dolphins, and oceanics.
Interestingly, even during winter months, the Red Sea is bathed because the water temperature is less than 20 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air is warmed to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C.].
The Dead Sea is warmer and bathed around the year.
By the way, it is the most unusual sea in the world at the lowest point on the planet, 417 metres below sea level.
The lacquoise water in it is sore that it is easily held in motion without even being able to swim at all.
The play is incredibly beautiful.
They're here to be treated using salty water - raps - and whole dirt - and to treat the health of dermatites, allergies, asthma, exemas, arthritis, bronchos, diabetes sugar, to clean up the broken nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Ancientity
They are preserved by the ancient Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffo on the Mediterranean Coast.
It was used by the famous Maritime Pathway, linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
It is said that it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
The tourists love to hang around the narrow streets named after Zodiac’s signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street with your "his" mark, Fortuna will be kind.
In Jaffa, young people from all over Israel and even from other countries can be met at the photo session.
And in Cesaria, the city of King Herod, you can sail through the Roman theater, "take" the fortresses.
In the Roman period, Caesar was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
A well-renovated theater is now used for evening concerts and opera plays.
A Visit to a Note
When you go to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population knows Russian.
Travel money is better than in euros, and it is in dollars that are easy to exchange for shekels (at present $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram, and in Haifa there is the only subway line in the country, which consists of six stations linking the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's an underground distiller.
Travel in all modes of urban transport costs six shekels, which can be transported within 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Sabbath is customary for a Jewish Sabbath.
From Friday to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transportation are terminated.
And Sunday morning begins a working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, it is only kosher food that excludes pigs, seafood, tealess fish and meat.
It offers a wide range of meats from lambs and beefs, soups, and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta Humous, various sauces, and threshing balls - phalalal, fruit, and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fattened cats that are actually "walking on their own".
At evening they can be seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Ants love people's places and don't give up food.
Rental of the car, depending on the label, would cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus, $15 a day.
And it's going to cost 15 pieces a day.
Museum tickets have an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the digits
In 2012, Israel visited over three million tourists from around the world.
The United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine were among the best to travel and rest.
From January to October 2012, there were 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists on the Earth, 51 per cent higher than 2010, before the lifting of visas on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and the Mighty" will lead to Moscow: migrants will dig money into the language
As long as deputies and human rights defenders argue that they will give the mandatory language testing law, fraudsters have already appeared in the country trading “lying” certificates.
Each year, 13 million gas - storage vehicles arrive in Moscow, Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left behind.
As of 1 December, a law had entered into force requiring each migrant worker to pass a Russian language test.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in services, housing and utilities, welfare and retail trade.
But over time, the FMS promises, the tests will become mandatory for all arrivals.
It will require not only Russian history but also Russian history and the basis of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both for receipt and for extension of the work permit.
Exemption applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is a public language.
The law does not apply to persons who have succeeded in obtaining certificates and diplomas of education prior to the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, obscenity and protection of rights
The Examination Point Network will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian, the University of Friendship of Peoples, IYU, SSPG and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
Both members of the State Duma and the FMS supported the testing initiative.
And before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press a question many times: What would that actually do?
What will change the binding nature of language for both Russians and visitors?
First of all, the migration service is responsible for reducing the number of people affected by “labour slavery”.
Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, as Viktor Eselev, head of the Russian FMS office in Tajikistan, explains.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment system would allow 90 per cent of foreign workers to solve problems.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, education, language without a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, I'm sure Ezelev, the future migrant is bound to face incredulous people who, under the aid of aid, are going to push him into a very tight barracks, where he and dozens of such ones will spend months hanging without food and documents, throwing 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“They are promised one thing in their homeland and are deceived by them when they arrive, collect passports, pay no promised salary”, confirms the Chief of the Directorate-General of Labour Migration of the International Labour Organization of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharip.
Don't fight, gnat!
However, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are about to earn money in Russia admit that not only do they not know the language of the country in which they aspire, they also find it difficult to write on their own.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, but their distress: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even interpretation primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to do with feeding their children, let alone dress them, discipline them, and carry them to school.
Up to the age of teenagers, such boys are sent to work at their earliest opportunity.
If not well-acquainted with their speech, they are admitted.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
True, with regard to the Language Act, human rights defenders point to one important point.
The test will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the gastabyters still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or you won't be allowed to enter."
Many visitors argue that it is not so easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is that there are bureaucratic obstacles and still the same linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs between 12,000 and 16,000 roubles.
But false registration can be done quickly and in just a thousand and a half years.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, there is no registration, and there are also cases of extortion.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," shared Tajikistanese citizen Oumed Hukudam with journalists.
"Come on, don't jump, buy pictures."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that not only migrant registration documents were false.
Several “liar” language test certificates have already been seized by the FMS.
Fake paper is printed on a regular colour printer.
Of course, they did not pay the new owners a price: each of the migrants who hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests paid seven thousand roubles for the document.
This is twice the cost of formal testing: it will cost a three thousand migrant workers.
The main challenge for the short term is to protect the system from corruption, so that bills cannot be bought, gathered between the authorities and human rights defenders.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise Gastrobeers who have not been able to pass the test since the first time, time for basic language courses.
In addition, a non-Russian visitor will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not engage in trafficking in the illicit arms market
The proportion of legal weapons crimes is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law on owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: the firing of shots at weddings without victims, and the massacre by Moscow's lawyer, Dmitri Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
The police want to ban the use of injury in public places and raise the age from which a arms licence can be obtained, from 18 to 21.
It was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption of Irin Yarovai and promised to amend the Weapons Act in the near future.
Not all are pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by “circling hacks”.
An open letter has emerged from the network, whose authors - representatives of various public small organizations - demand that the “unreasonable tightening” be eliminated.
The percentage of bullying with registered weapons was minimal, and the BBC Russian Service had been told by criminal lawyer Vasili Lesnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 firearms offences registered with the internal affairs authorities were committed in six months of 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of civil weapons legislation does not force the offender to enter the black market.
They now say that any weapons can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to control the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Vendors: from factories to officers
The Black Arms Market is being expanded through several channels.
The main channels are five, reports Colonel Victor Barantez, who has worked in the Ministry of Education and Genstab for ten years.
Screen of the weapons order site
The first is “army or military trace”, that is, weapons stolen during hostilities in the Caucasus.
"The guns were dragged by Russian officers and the Caucasus themselves," says Baranz.
The next type of black weapon is stolen from members of the security forces by criminals.
Barantz explains that these include both stolen police warehouses and stolen personnel directly from law enforcement personnel.
Illegal guns are being sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions have often occurred.
"There's evidence that part of the fires was made specifically -- to cover up the shortage," said the former military.
As Barantz says, arms manufacturers are making their contribution.
“In the meantime, private arms factories are producing productions that do not withstand competition in the international market and throw weapons out of the floor into the black market, including Moscow,” the expert explains.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
There are particularly many guns and machine guns coming from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's its production, sometimes handicraft, and there's a Mafia that's organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where's the gun from?
The experts considered what was the approximate share of each of the sources of illicit arms transfers to the “black” market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Concern Analysis and Public Management Design.
The specialists reviewed the records of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data of portals on weapons topics.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers write, come from the army and the security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market were found there “by fault of officials whose work is related to weapons”, says the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of cases of weapons coming from areas of armed conflict, 14 per cent of cases of theft at the time of manufacture of weapons, and 5 per cent of cases involve “black archaeology”.
The consultant seller of one of the arms stores who asked not to call his name assures us that the weapons found by the black diggers have been gone for a long time without anyone buying - too old.
Most of the time, he says, a new batch of vendors is going to a military warehouse.
Through the banner, a person buys a unit, for example, the gun TT.
They're sending her out, they're handing him over to the fence.
"He's moving her to town and he's selling 900 euros for something with two stores," he says.
“It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when the crime detection plan burns periodically, the police conducts a control purchase from traffickers of illegal weapons,” adds the consultant.
"How's the luxury store?"
The seller and buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked on websites, on blogs, until there was a friend who offered to come to God's platform where there would be someone who would take me to the corner where we would trade.
I only knew the price of the gun there.
Military observer Victor Barantez
I need a friend who has a way out to get my gun, says a consultant seller.
There are sellers in the markets, but we also have to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanović, who asked to pass on the daughter's tooth."
I'm getting a couple of tapes right now through someone I'm sure of.
He's giving them to me, too, because he knows I won't give it to him.
Novices look for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranz tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing an article on it for publication.
The scheme, he said, has not changed.
They gave him an album with photos of "anything."
"I felt like a luxury store," remembers the military.
You don't have a cat in a bag, you can try it, according to Baranc.
I'm a potential client, not just buying -- we're going to go to the woods with the seller, where we're targeting.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I'm convinced that weapons are going well, we're starting to trade," the expert describes the procedure.
The shop on the couch
Internet researchers are taking Web sites and groups to Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons “for different purposes”.
No papers or personal meetings are needed to do this.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they're writing in an ad cap on the website, "Cooping up a gun or a machine gun."
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will the minor be sold?
“No licence of course”, asks the user of Ivan (orthography retained).
"T. Moscow Cup" is a concise formulation of the Federenkov request.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of front sites and wants to buy weapons of war with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they get to Siberia coal.

I've heard about these schemes: the site is usually registered outside Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer through the ATM makes payments.
"In response, they send a photograph and an instruction in which the weapons are hidden," says Dmitri Kislov, public secretary of the organization Right to Arms.
Victor Barantze claims that by leaving an application on the website, you can stay without a weapon and get in jail.

Macars for $100.
Experts estimate that between $100 and $900 can be deposited when purchasing illicit small arms.
According to Dmitry Kislov of Right to Arms, Makarov's gun can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month or a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by middle-level management.
According to the official statistics of the agency, the number of such offences in general for Russia fell by 7 per cent from January to October 2011, to 22.9 per cent, and the number of reported thefts and extortions of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States there are fast food workers and supermarkets.
Through work at the McDonalds Fund, up to a quarter of all American teenagers are employed
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in the department of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as Maddonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendes and Kentukki Fraid Chiken.
As long as no one is willing to predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth shaft or is destined to breathe out at an early stage.
Actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-hand public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages paid to private employees by Walmart and the fast food system, the aim of the protestors is to establish trade union organizations within them.
Until this sector of the economy is almost covered by trade union movements.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week, after Thanks Day, on a so-called “Black Friday”, when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sale, which took millions of obscenaries and sometimes was accompanied by fervor.
On that day, some employees of the Walmart Corporation, who employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and pictured with trade unions and left-wing activists the company ' s stores, whose products count on people of modest and medium means.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from ashes, hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in his shops range from 8% to 27% are cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of Walmart’s low - paying workers are only on their own employment.
The availability and range of goods were made by Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods at low cost, partly because he pays little to his employees.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, such as lack of vehicle loaders or hand scanners.
The participants in the “Black Friday” stock demanded an increase in salary and complained that the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation had jumped from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart worker who gets $9.5 per hour, that's not in his pocket, they say.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley have shown that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, it costs a corporation of $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1 percent more than she's spending on wages now.
If Walmart's entire pay increase is transferred to the customers' shoulders, every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
They're going to spend 12.39 more dollars a year than they are right now.
Supporters of Walmart note enough that protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any minor damage to the corporation.
The Black Friday continued at her shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday night until midnight the following day, and Walmart was selling about 5,000 items per second during that time.
In total, her cashiers made nearly 100 million transactions at the “Black Friday”.
The representative of Dan Fogelman, in an interview with Huffington Post, argued that jobs had left the “less than five” Walmart employees, and that the protest had been merely “a regular piarov trick” of her trade union.
"Free Cass!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart's department (they are not complained in this progressive city and are therefore not yet here) but Maddonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals or pay you an honest job!
Jumain Williams, New York member
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
The fast food resorts increase the food supply over time, but not in significant terms, and on average, their workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less in this dear city.
As can exist in New York for that kind of money, it's impossible for me.
At one time, McDonalds had nearly one quarter of American teenagers working for their post-school counters while living with their parents.
Few people have seen this basic source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I'm constantly facing interviews with Madonalds employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal forum, there is a comment that the author notes that it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them on.
The protests, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday morning at Maddonalds in 40th Street and Madison Avenue, required cashiers and fast food cooks to start paying at least $15 an hour, that is, more than double their current minimum earnings.
They also required that trade union organizations be established in the area of fast food.
American law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing trade unionists with fads and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
But it is also difficult to include fast food for trade unions for objective reasons.
One of the main things is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
Dissenting
The silent protests were held on that day and at a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
In the middle of the day, the gathering at McDonalds next to Times Square, where several local democratic politicians spoke, in particular, Jomain Williams, who said, "Macdonalds", says that he sells billions of pieces, and then he doesn't even give you sick people or pay you for your honest work."
Other prominent New York democracies, for example, were also supported by the demonstrators as a candidate for Bill De Blacio's mayor, who stated that “we should be friendly in supporting fast-food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.”
As the New York Times described, it was the largest act of this kind in the history of the American field of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were workers of a fast general hospital, where tens of thousands of people are employed in New York City.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will give rise to mass traffic.
"As long as you're fooling your brain, you're getting middle."
A popular theme among modern technology fans has recently been accepted mainly through the perspective of special points.
At first, in the summer of its annual conference, Google showed the model and then in November, it became known that Microsoft had applied for a patent.
However, from a conversation with the leader of an interactive 3D technology team at the Microsoft Sharm Izadi laboratory in Cambridge, it is clear that for scientists in the company, glasses are a stage that has been covered.
Their vision of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you tell me what your research team is doing?
- We're dealing with machines, but we're trying to open up the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as the masses of mankind are stuck at work with their pixels on a flat screen, sometimes with their finger.
We want to look 5-10 years forward and anticipate the fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinct because everybody is interested in sign management.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Despite the fact that Kinct's interaction has taken on a physical level, much is still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The entry of information has improved (the system receives more data) and the output is not yet very good.
We're trying to change this, we're working on really three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including design ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, making it more tangible.
To do so, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient way.
And above all, those stupid helmets are virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
Popular thing, but don't they overestimate it?
- He's certainly not called a panacea - a question of privacy, because he doesn't always want to inform others about his actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but everyone in their niches.
For example, in order to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about obsessive ones, but about these tight, short ones.
At the same time, the gestures were removed, not by a camera of the device, but by a hand-cuffed bracelet that fixed the movement of the bones and muscles.
As long as it's large, but theoretically, it can be reduced to the size of handcuffed hours.
But the future of a mixed kind of government, for example, is a gesture+voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this gas bank?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just saying.
- Oh, it'll be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine might or could not do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's mutual convergence.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mostly to develop new types of sensors that will allow us to define more accurately the human response.
It could be laser sensors, they give a good resolution deep down, it's very important.
- In terms of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Is there enough permission, deep or something?
In principle, the present generation is something that can be diverted from our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get mega-pixels 8 at 1000 km/s.
But it's not about the mega-pixels themselves, it's about the matrix and the depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, which adds to the work of algorithm designers.
So we need to remember not only the X and Y authorization but also Z.
It's also very important speed, the number of personnel per second.
The human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 km/s are frankly low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes, from our Redmond Laboratory, made a sensor with a controlled delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60 to 100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects man’s interaction with machines.
I'd be very useful in my work for the equivalent of such a device, but it doesn't require any more personnel per second.
- You don't need to increase the number of cameras?
-Kinct now has three cameras, one of which is actually infrared radiation, and the other is a display signal receiver.
And then the third camera is actually a normal visible range sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the facility.
A potentially larger number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or intensify it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible equivalent of Kinct, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how this can help to define the situation three-dimensionally.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present her glasses to the public.
Don't you think, from the point of view of everyday use of compounded reality technologies, that's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, to walk around all the time, to keep a smartphone in your arms up, not very comfortable, but I think that the coolest option would be a "transmitting" added reality, where, on the basis of the cloud platform, you could switch from points to a smartphone, a projection display to anywhere else.
The glasses are a very personal device, and that's their strength (only you can see things in private) and at the same time, weakness -- an added score-based reality will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that is often criticized: There is no tactful response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that the supplemented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human and machine interaction.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile feelings.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a kind of cover for the image.
She's a great press recorder!
But there are technologies that really aim at giving these "in-air cards" a sense of visibility -- for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic beams at a particular point where your finger is located -- gives you a sense of feeling, but as long as it's very weak -- it's like being blown up on pillows.
There are wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in your fingers -- also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain?
Making him think he feels what he's supposed to feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is yet another challenge to be addressed: how to force a person physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking through an open, almost endless, and working on the concepts of pathways (not necessarily in clubs) moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
As long as the brain gets medium, it's been working for a long time.
That's what makes working on the virtual reality so attractive to the researcher -- a lot of things in their initial state.
The taste instead of culture is Rosbolt.ru.
"Rosbolt" is continuing the project "Peterburg Avangard", which focuses on the citizens that are ahead of it, in the vanguard of culture and art.
The top list has already been marked by bright artists of the art scene of Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often in recognition in Europe, past all-Russia prominence.
The new hero of "Rosbolt" is the emotional artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirilla Miller, a man who's been dressed in red, who meets at the Russian Museum, and at the Summer Garden, and on the fashionable shoes and renegades.
Kirilla Miller's paintings always collect a bunch of viewers wherever they stand.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely Petersburg socio-philosophic storytellers who are the creators of new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the Petersburg vanguard at the end of the '80s, the beginning of the '90s.
He is also a man of the city who, by his appearance on the streets, smiles at citizens, raising everyone's spirits.
Recently, he took up a scarman and became a peterburger because he had ripened for this complex role all his divine existence, philosophy, and image.
- Kirill, why are you walking around town in all red instead of yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a model for sight and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and society.
While everything in society that is slightly non-serene is causing aggression and bad characterization.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
All the history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the Exhibition in Nevsk DC, where my work was exhibited.
I realized this was my way.
Then a wave of free old informal artists passed, and new, free-style artists didn't understand me.
I started to be friends with artists of a new wave, with a post-gasp landscape that led to "Pushkinsky 10", and there was no more wave.
I'm being thrown into theatre, clothes, music, all but a word.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... and it was important for me to be at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where I had to gather all the best creative powers.
In 1995, I took territory on Pashkin-10, and there, while there was no repair, there was a music and artistic club, a god club, a house of a Petersburg god.
Many were born there: NOMA, Tekila Jazz, I remember Shnoura being brought in with a project called "Oho Van Gogh."
Snoor and his friends sang light songs under their plywoods, they were in a tightant, and among them was now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played alive, she became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the lead in many of the programs prior to the Khali-Ghali era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and his basic education and education were at our disposal.
The D 137 Gallery, the Gryboeds Club, these are calls from the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and all the people are gone.
I'm a hero of last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, and the prize was "People of our town."
I was named "The Master of the Year," and my climax ended.
In new times, it's not easy to work under old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, and it can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is characterized by a well-informed manner.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, they have a very clear sense of urgency and urgency.
I'll have a program exhibition, "Rus Museum in clowns."
clowns are a non-temporal category.
I used to be social, now being like that is painful and frightening.
But in clowns, it's all dislodged, tragicism is done.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian re-adjustment.
The clothes are now being used for external mechanics rather than for internal man.
Maybe he shouldn't have a hand in his face too.
And lies will be removed by re-dressing.
- And we saw you recently as a urban char human being.
Who but me, they should be.
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be neat, tactical, sweet.
There's a disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people flocked to packs, one god loved one, and another god loved another.
Now, everybody's broken up into micro-socials, it's hard for everybody to like now.
I'm not a hundred-dollar paper for everybody to like.
Now you have to think who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 worshipers.
- At Stas Mikhaylova, it's a few thousand!
- He's got rolls on him, and the sex and social sphere works out.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and eventually less management, less money, everything smells.
I have worshipers, and above all, I don't lie to them, I don't ruin what I'm getting.
I used to write pictures like this when I was a teenager, they're on a wall next to Falk and Larion's wedding.
I started with pictures that usually end.
There's a lot of confusion now.
They say that culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There's no culture of consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of culture yesterday, and I grew up with the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, giving up money to paint paintings.
I'm for this kind of culture.
- Kirill, what's Peterburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion: an official from a culture.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
The kings of the right kings may not have understood much about culture, but they realized that the proper experts needed to be kept in mind.
There's good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're stuck because they need better experts who will properly evaluate these experts and guide them.
Now there's a taste.
The same thing as Erarta, but they're different from what they're honest about is that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there's a lot more culture in Moscow, there's soil.
It's hard to grow on our stones.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than we do readers, which is wrong.
There's a lot of people in Europe who are curious. You know, there's a lot of people who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We've got a bit of a ton.
We need to make it fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented for the St. Petersburg grant
Born in Space
Earth's in danger.
Global warming or collision with Asteroid Killer.
Launched spaceships carrying earthships are sent on board to search for a reserve planet.
In order to preserve mankind, the main question arises, How can we continue our family life in a climate of indiscretion or on the same reserve planet?
I think there's no choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be developed in a hypothetical way.
“This is Venus and Mars”, says Senior Fellow of the P.C. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAIS) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus, the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in Venus orbit... in space.
The field of reproduction in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, they experimented with plants.
Four generations of orbiting peas were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then, in-orbit insects, tiny, fruit flies.
In 1979, eggs were sent to outer space to check on the growth of the embryo in a state of indiscretion.
We're getting on the way out of a perfectly normal bird.
And then the problem begins.
“The problem is that this bird has to find resistance, it has to stand on its legs and start moving,” explains the laboratory director of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of Ran Vladimir Sitchev.
Without any resistance, the birds swirled indiscriminately.
Ten hours later, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light and sound.
And the trouble was, four days later, they just died.
"And twice we hatched the birds, then we refused because it's just impossible there to work with them," says Vladimir Sitchev's experiment with the birds in space failed.
With animals, the last time the biological "micicache" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex persons will be on the Bion biosputnik.
There was an experiment with rats that were being sent into space with fruit.
In principle, there was nothing supernatural about it.
"It was on biosputers, but again, it is a single experiment, and such research must be carried out," Vladimir Sitchev noted.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet working.
It's not an easy task.
The animal, the loss, the habit of living, simply cannot realize its own sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and is able to create a proper emotional background.
There are no such experiments for ethical reasons.
But women in space have been flying for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkov.
And the most precious thing humanity has is a woman's organism.
Our Ceek has left, and no one on Earth could say, "Will it stay in space after it's gone?
Is she capable of having a baby after that flight?
"No one answered this question," says a veteran in the Wachtang Wakovedze missile and space industry.
In June 1964, just one year after the space flight, the first female cosmonaut Valentine Tereshkova gave birth to her daughter.
Andrian Nicolaus ’ father was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitsk, the second female cosmonaut, had a son on two occasions in orbit and even worked in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have enough, we have spacemen, and after long flights, we have a healthy generation.
"And if it's larger, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," then the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
Yet, there is a need for humanity to look for new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydrolaboratoria is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in a zero-floating environment, astronauts develop skills in the open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If, for adults, water, though comfortable, is a foreign environment, it's natural for infants.
It's like the little Ethyanders confirm that life on land has gone out of the ocean.
There is a link between the baby’s being in an Occult fluid for about nine months, and being used to water later.
In principle, that makes sense, because it takes only two weeks from the time of birth, from the time of that first bath.
"It's very small to forget something," says December instructor Marina Axenov.
By the word, if a child has a more natural condition, she needs gravity, the strength of gravity.
Very quickly the muscles of the belly, the tasa, and the ability to push the fetus out of the body are drenched in oblivion.
All right, let's just put this down by relying on birth-related stimulants.
Of course, in a special cell, you can go to birth, and she'll push him out.
"Then what?" asks the impertinent questions of Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
Without the touch of the earth, the body does not form a skeleton or a muscle system.
It is not possible for a newly born in orbit to wear a special load suit for exercise as an adult.
He'll just be deprived of what he needs.
"And this experiment that you and I are going to do by allowing a child to be born in a foreign environment will lead us to bring a disabled, totally decontaminated human to Earth," predicts the head of the bioethics committee of IMP Ran Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a question of theory.
In time, however, this will be a reality when earthmen on their ships travel to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of Audit and Audit Office: Check of the crash system has failed due to policy makers.
In public procurement, the Czech Republic had good control and, despite the existence of quality legislation, was behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for Aktuáln.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack," commented Kal's current situation.
Such findings are provided by joint inspections of Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of wrong practices, Peter’s approach to the so-called quartz system is followed.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the GPA (Citizen Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - this is prohibited or permitted?
“The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister may not oppose the work of institutions which are required to verify and enforce obligations”, notes Kala.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, which compared the laws on public procurement of both countries.
What was specific about?
There is a parallel test that we started two years ago.
Simply put, the European law argues how public procurement should be conducted, followed by national legislation and then applied in practice as well.
All the information has been collected and, even with an incomplete test, interesting differences have been found - simply put, we may have “accurate and infallible” legislation, but we are putting Germany down on some of the parameters in practice.
It follows that it is not sufficient to create more and more detailed rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, exactly, what does it mean to you?
It is this joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions because this does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're going to achieve this by reducing the limits of orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with bubabuses so that those who want to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction did not go down.
You are talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization such as our CBU (Control and Audit Office) or does it work differently?
With regard to institutions, Bundesrechungshof, which we set up in principle, also has a panel working in a slightly different way, but mostly both institutions operate in a similar way.
In addition, powers are to some extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the federal land level - their system is slightly different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting chambers.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is it easier than we do?
Actually, I don't want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it's not necessarily better in everything.
That's because they're better at controlling?
Of course not, but again, I don't like that comparison.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have benefited from any cooperation with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, how did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affect your institution, in some way, the consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is relatively short, it has not yet been demonstrated in our verification work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, some delay must be taken into account.
We're taking this into account only in the preparation of future inspections -- we're starting to use our new tool for "discovering the risk of insecurities," through which we've driven almost 14,000 government contracts -- we've analysed them -- and of course, these changes are going to happen because the constraints change, the conditions of some types of tenders change, and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law will bring benefits or additional burdens on the system of bureaucracies?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules are “enhanced” and will not be enforced.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with the regional board) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does this mean that the law should be tightened in this way?
I think it's not that way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse but do not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only put even greater pressure on bureaucraty.
And then how do you get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the GPA will not bother entrepreneurs with the checks of the so-called quartz system.
"Schwarz system" prohibited or permitted?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister could not oppose the work of bodies which were required to verify and enforce obligations.
We can say, "We're going to change this law and let it go," but we can't say we're gonna pretend like nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains quite strict rules, as well as formal rules, and this is correct, which will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the best-proposed candidate is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some Czech places, roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly passing, but there's a little bit more careful.
Carovarian Land
This morning there were roads in Carlovarian's edge, but some of them are frozen and snowy.
The temperature has dropped from 5 to 10 degrees below zero, but it has to warm slightly during the day.
The snowfall in the region has ceased, only in the lowlands is a small layer.
However, there are about six inches [30 cm] of snow lying on the ridges of the Red Mountains.
The information received from regional road workers revealed that the places were less visible because of the fog.
The R6 speed and the first-class roads in the region are now under way without restriction.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads in the second and third classes, including mountain roads, are passing.
But on some of their plots are still the remains of frozen snow and the places where the snow is driven.
You need to be especially careful on high - rise roads.
Partubian and Kralovegradsky Land
The Czech Road and Motorways Administration reports on its Internet pages that some roads in eastern Czech Republic are threatened by a cold, while mountain roads and highland roads may be hit by snow.
Area road workers warn drivers of the hoolide, which may be particularly present on the highlands of the Pardubic region.
Gold may be near Lanscroun, Usti-na-Orlica, Polytice, Svitavi or Vishka-Mito, especially on second- and third-class roads.
Road I/43 and I/34, located in Stitawi, are treated with chemicals.
The snow lies especially on the roads of the Krkonoša and the Eagle Mountains.
The snowline is located on roads situated on high ground in the Rihnova-na-Knezhnou and Trutnova areas.
In East Czech Republic today, there's no rain-free cloud.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Plzeen Land
The roads in the Plesen province are passing this morning, but places need to be careful and adjust to weather.
In the morning, the temperature varies from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, in some places it may be slippery.
Drivers may encounter fog in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
The D5 road is now almost without restrictions, but road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
The southern regions of Plzeni and Tahokha may fall into frozen areas.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and there is also a warning for the possibility of sliding areas.
Drivers must be careful, especially on low-use roads in the Shumawa area.
The Olomautian Land
Drivers heading up the Olomoucean edge must take into account today the snow-fowl on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenhogor sedl and on the road towards the Videl Kršij.
On the night of the snowfall, road workers were forced to enter the streets, according to information from road authorities, to reach about three inches [3 cm] of snow in Schumperke.
In other areas, roads tend to pass without restrictions.
"There are snow residues in the high places of Schumperk.
Drivers heading towards Esenica must bear in mind the presence of snow-flakes in the Cherevengore Sedle,” said CHAN (Czech Agency of News) today a noise control controller for road traffic control.
During the night, their colleagues from Esenica were on their way to clear the roads, and they assured them that the roads on high ground had remained bare and wet after treatment.
In Olomouc, roads are free of restrictions, but in Sternberg drivers must be attentive to forest areas where humidity is still present.
Osteak Land, Liberian Land
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that several difficult places remain.
According to information from the police database, apart from a few places with a hoolide or snowfall, a mountain road is closed at a section from Telica in the Klinica in the Ustec province.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so there are snows and ices on the roads, especially to the south-east of the Czech Midlands, on the contrary, there is no problem, the road is mostly dry.
Road complications have not yet been reported.
Road workers report a cold in the vicinity of Stetta.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for his creation at night were created -- all day long it rained and snowed, the sky cleared up at night and the freeze began.
Adverse conditions are reported on the main highway and on road I/13 on the border of the Ustex and the Liberian border.
Because of the snowy branches of the trees relating to the road itself, they were forced to shut down the road in Thessalnice at Kninica.
Shimon Orest: We want positive energy in concerts
What do you think is that in less than a month, the end of the world must come?
It's just one of many disturbing news stories that we humans are so easily exposed to.
Together with the group The Tap Tab, we are constantly joking about this and saying that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you're going to give an absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell us more about it?
This is a nationwide fund-raising exercise, which we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, which was announced on 21 December at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20, at 9:00, three concerts are launched in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at a time when the May calendar will end on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, whose time zone is 12 hours before we do.
Who's in charge of this idea?
I mean, that was my idea, and then we all thought about it together with our artist Gonza Augustosta.
In addition to the fact that we want to build enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which this world will one day pass over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of footwear, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world, which can be bought at www.e-tap.cz and thus support us at the same time.
The Top Tab group, together with other musicians, also carried out a giant against the end of the world, called "The End of the Light is to be cancelled".
Will the gymn of this Beneficial concert sound like a favorite YouTube audience?
Of course, at the very end, if it all works out and the end of the world doesn't come.
He'll be served by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
Dwarfs will also be heard on live Czech television simultaneously.
The words to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in Tomas Hanak's video, and so is Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We are also cooperating with the other officers of Czech cultural life, as we have many charitable events and concerts.
We're trying to actively involve them in these projects.
Turns out a lot of people like to work with us, they're curious.
What's the profit from the concert against the end of the world?
To buy equipment for the STUDEO education centre, we've been working with the Tap civil association for the sixth year at Yedlička Institute.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Yedlička Institute Schools and have fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are thus trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the Edlika Institute ' s additional construction project, there will be a separate building in the future to which we will move with this project.
A number of musical groups and performers will speak at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to create a programme that will be of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tab Tab, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi will be featured in Prague.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such “serious activities” in the future?
In May, we're going to be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring festival, and here, of course, we're going to have an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would be happy to have a presentation at the Czech National House in New York, and I would like to speak in Washington and Chicago if we were to be in the United States.
About the border with you, you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks at first sight.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and tools boxes.
The Czech Airways and British Airways have always been excellent for us, which I have been surprised to find so many times.
Even in Moscow, where we came from recently, everything went well.
Through travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with persons with disabilities, and so forth.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, we have seen in Russia that we are still at a basic level in the east.
Compared to Prague, Moscow has many barriers, and is still home to the wildebeest of man on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
There are also such banal things as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, social organizations are already emerging that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the other hand, do we always have to catch up with the best countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to make sure that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's normal for people with severe disabilities to move themselves on the streets, go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
It's not so common there is that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, and that's why we're taking them up a little bit ahead of The Tap Tab!
Respect for the public or free will be one thing, but at a time when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, everyone will actually start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases -- people with strong will.
The Top Tab group is now very popular, but will we come back two years ago, that in 1998 you were forced to organize it?
I went to Yedlika as a tutor, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself, and I'm playing on a saxophone, I've organized an interesting music box with my colleague.
Well, over time, as our leader, Lady Angelovice, says, it's a little out of control. (Laughter)
And popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confused?
It's true, it's been helpful for us to start joining famous singers and working actively on the propaganda group.
We have come to the conclusion that a job that no one can appreciate actually does not exist.
With European Union funds, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Have you ever had the goal of untieing the Tab Tab so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their capacity to do something extraordinary.
Show business is full of things that imitate each other.
It makes sense, everything new is adopted with caution, and it lasts for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, is pity, it's natural...
But that pity is quite bitter, because people with disabilities are not suffering and all missing persons that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's not just a shift for them, but for society as a whole.
Has it been successful that you are a strict leader, as many people consider you?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be free in many things and to follow a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to practice twice a week, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
At present, there are twenty members of the Group The Tap Tap.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
Just one Lady Angelović.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have willpower and desire, our doors are always open.
It will be held one day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20.12.2012, at 2 p.m.
The concert will be held in Prague in Incheba Stadium, Brno in the Club Fléda and Ostrava in the centre of Plynojem, with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians in Czechia.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a telemote at the time of the song of The Tap Tab, "The End of the Light is Canceled."
The aim of this project is to raise funds of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multi-functional, barbarous equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at Yedlička Institute in Prague.
A concert ticket costs 400 crowns, for children under 12 years of age free of charge, and tickets can be bought in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after Czechia, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has been actively involved in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But Poland's path to space started before.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always understood.
Let me remind you, for example, of A. Sterfeld's lecture, which, on December 6, 1933, represented the idea at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory of its innovative work "Introduction into Space."
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years, Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Hadowski had an interest in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno Peltre Award and André Luis Hirsch for Introduction to Space.
Jan Hadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonauts.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Hadamsky became a well-known world advocate of space, and his contribution was appreciated, including the fact that one of the craters on the other side of the Moon had been named after him.
As early as 1925, Poland had built a rail cutter equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as did the details of the draft.
It is not even clear whether a rocket had to be used for a chase or for braking.
Information about this drift is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has begun to think about missiles.
The study was carried out by the Weapons Technology Section in cooperation with Professors Macheslav Wolfke and Gustav Mokjiskim.
The remaining materials show that the studies have reached the practical test stage.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the specialized press introduced the idea of an electric fighter rocket proposed by an engineer in Rogozinski, and the following year the work of the “Establishment of the carrier missile and the bomb rocket” of the author of Lévalia Khivoloski was launched.
Both projects have been developed for the military use of missile engines.
Prior to the war, all military missile projects had been dealt with by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which had coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, it was completed because of the outbreak of war.
The next work on space science appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, reference is made to society in the November 1954 issue of “Problems”, which contains four voluminous articles on Astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotović proposed to organize a society that would be involved in space.
By then, artificial satellite projects had been gaining momentum, and space research was clearly a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Society (POA) has tried to join the international Astronautics Federation (based in 1951) and has become a valid member of the Astronautics Federation in the autumn of 1951.
The following year, Kazymed Zarankevich, First President of PAA (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
As such, he remained until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PAA has contributed significantly to the development of the very successful RM meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorogiczna), which was the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first type was launched on 10 October 1958.
A missile capable of reaching a distance of 1,800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved RM-1A version was built and two-step RM-2 rocket testing was conducted in the Bledov Desert in the summer of 1959.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to perform real scientific work -- an RM-34 rocket could have exceeded 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high wind.
In 1962, however, further development was suspended.
The original RM-type missile was inherited by a meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed to be two-tiered, its total length was 510 cm and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked as Meteorological-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were different in size for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A missile has a 0.4-litre, a 1-B-0.34-litre-methore-C-0.62-L.
The maximum range for all three types of flight was 37 km.
During the period from 1965 to 1968, the Aviation Institute developed a meteor-2 rocket and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
A 380 kg meteor-2 rocket was able to produce a useful cargo of 10 kg per height of about 60 km.
The version of Meteorological-2N and Meteorological-3 were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland ' s accession to COSPAR (the Space Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Law on Public Works.
The decree generated a lively discussion in society.
It would no doubt be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberalized economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is related to the principle of free trade and free, unfettered private capital movements along with unsolicited financial speculation.
A significant difference in the cost of the labour force (remunerated) results in price stress.
This notion must be understood as a condition in which a manufacturer, through the delivery of cheap goods, tries to resist economic competition by “stirring” the value of a competitor in order to take up most of the market and thus increase his own income.
On a large scale, this means that most entrepreneurs either carry over overseas production or low-cost purchases abroad or disappear, resulting in increased unemployment in countries where the cost of labour is high compared with others.
As private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including its unemployment, the inevitable social expenditures of the State are increasing.
In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of business owners to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social and economic damage they have suffered in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Unskilled private capital practices create a situation at the level of economies in individual States where Governments have to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments are handing over their own population to private capital in spite of social declines.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the legislation in force.
The aim is to make their people economically subject themselves to the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in case of long-term unemployment, while at the same time serving as a tool to reduce the rights of workers in labour law.
As a result, poverty levels are rising and the gap between the poor and the rich is increasing.
The FAR has been a public food distribution for several years to poor people who are unable to feed themselves on their own work.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
As part of the improved competitiveness of the German economy, there have always been instances where employed people receive such wages that the State has to pay them to get a minimum of living.
Such a scandal has also become known to the public in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU States undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people under pressure from a disastrous decline in social status are forced either to emigrate, as in the 19th century, or to live on low wages in the backs of society, in the hope that private investment will ever come into the country.
But I wonder where he's going to come from.
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African is still working for the share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media pre-tense claim that a State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the State should not intervene in the economy.
The question should then be answered whether private capital, now practically the policy manager and that whole State, is operating for their own selfish purposes.
The obvious answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of almost all-powerful and omnipresent lobbyes in all States.
As a result, we have an unprecedented situation of corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment but is not a crime.
In the FWG, the situation is that government ministries, owing to lack of financial resources, are responsible for the drafting of bills to private legal firms that are closely linked to industry.
These bills are then confirmed by the Bundestag.
All power derives not from the people, as stated in the Western Constitution, but from the financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberalized democracy is now rapidly emerging in such a situation as described by Appiana in “The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompeii”: “The State has long been breaking up and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Takings, illegal receipt of grace by means of stones and swords.
Stealing and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to elections with a pre-sold vote” ... good people did not vote at all for the position of ruler, and eventually the State was left without a consul for eight months ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As in ancient times, today's society is dominated by its own reckless interests without regard for public interests.
Private capital is no longer intended for public purposes.
The present outcome is not different from the past: the unprecedented fall of the elite without any effort to reform more deeply.
So the reason for the fascist and communist regimes is that we must seek in the reckless liberalization of economic systems for the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected to follow.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a decision or at least not permanent.
Under pressure from competition at both international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systematic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen State ownership of the economy, enhance the role of citizens in the governance of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the public interest.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"There will be nothing out of violence, and it will never come out." "Sting, "Heaven," where the main poem of the Refremen is, "Don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't have been" -- the dying Gutel Schneper, the wife of Meer Amshel Rotschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated many reactions.
Some argue in favour of Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians, arguing against this racism of the Israeli State, genocide against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel assigns the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about who in these recurrent waves of killings is a criminal and who, in the end, the victims of today ' s Israeli citizens, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and who have not witnessed the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the curtain, to see who is first and foremost served by the 95 years of tension (taking into account the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small portion of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are backed by historical facts, some of which were derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is above all the history of the struggle for power.
In every age, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
Which is not so clear whether these people have always taken their own steps, or behind their throne was someone who guided their actions towards their intended goals.
We should be allowed to live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons and that this concentration of money and the resulting authority could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among astronomically rich families, there's one that can be seen as the head of the sprit (I don't know if someone's worth it, but it's not excluded) - Rotschild.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they had bought in the 1990s to end rumours linking their name to criminal acts in the higher spheres in which they were located and which had always led to their power, wealth, or both.
They have large packages of shares in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries whose central banks do not own their share, they are conducting or preparing war (there were only 7 countries before the invasion of Afghanistan, five countries after the invasion of Iraq, only four remaining after the overthrow of Kaddafi, but the Russian Government has taken over the central bank of its country).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain his central bank status under the Rotschild Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to produce his own (know - government) money and was killed in 1865 at the theater.
John F. Kennedy started making his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System) in 1963, and Deputat Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue FED for the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their desire for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, created by Albert Pike, a large masson of 33.
The first war was to destroy monarchic States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 to 1 billion (the number of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much of their resources), the establishment of a unified universal religion (ecumenism could not be anything but a prerequisite for such a project) and the ultimate takeover of absolute power.
The method used by a group of the richest families led by Rotschild is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (orer ab Chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the base of FED, which was intended to prevent a recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unleash the First World War by killing the Gobsburg heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia by launching a Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended in the sudden military and economic capitulation of Germany (there was no need for war to destroy royal Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary, was fragmented.
In order to facilitate the establishment of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany, which led to the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then only to give the Germans a strong enough, obliging perpetrators and offering simple solutions to the Leader, further to establish a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed to act as a fifth column in fuelling the war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rotschild initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have taken place on both sides.
The Second World War had broken out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had broken out of the chains in which he was initially held by bankers or what he had done, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps had created the prerequisites for recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reprisals for the 2nd world war, the State of Israel was declared to create the hotbed of the third war.
If international bankers can untie it, the Jewish people, like the Second World War, will be the victims of battle on the front line, now with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country but also at the international level (referring only a sharp separation of the people into Israel ' s supporters and opponents).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the insult causes an endless chain of violence if it all begins with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
There is a need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are putting people to vote for election solely of their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Yasabneanyahu, is a typical example of fascist, loyal international bankers as a politician, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran ' s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to develop into a world conflict, and given Iran ' s control over the Ormuz Strait, which contains 20 per cent of the world ' s oil resources (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is served by a handful of financial aristocratics enjoying comfort.
A world where every child born at birth is implanted in a chip, with which it becomes a creature under total control.
“And compels all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to be branded on their right hand or forehead, so that a person who is not marked by the name of that beast or by the number of its name can neither buy nor sell.
That is the wisdom. Everyone who has knowledge can calculate the number of animals.
For it corresponds to a human name, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
The "Operation Argo" filter: When you're not there, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic demonstration students captured the US Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrow of the Shah Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who had fled after the U.S. revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not meant to be -- it could not afford to let itself be thrown overboard because it could have undermined the trust of allies in other countries.
However, it was unable to achieve the liberation of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to a theocratic regime.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to release hostages by force.
Prisoners were finally released after 444 days, following negotiations facilitated by the Government of Algeria.
Their fate has generated a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended in Ronald Reagan's election.
The film by actor Ben Afflek “Operation “Argo” describes one of the episodes of the story that brought little victory to America.
Shortly before the Embassy occupation, six employees escaped.
After difficult initials, they finished their journey to the residence of the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, succeeded in removing them from Iran, with an extravagance cover story saying that they had gone to Canada ' s passports as members of a survey team that had located a site in the country to survey the science and science epidemic.
Union of gents
The plan, which had been invented by Tony Mendez' evacuation expert, required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order for the legend to be reliable, specialized magazines reported on the project of the film, press conferences were organized, and a fabricated manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez’s memoirs.
Affleka filter is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political triller, so-called "phim-kinopus," the story of the good idea, the con -- an example -- could be a series of movies about Oschen's friends.
The film constantly changes the moods - on the one hand, the documented scenes from Tehran (the tits show a marked historical picture of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no major differences in that).
On the other hand, the eased needles of the Hollywood fragments overlap with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in costumes discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone...
Ben Affleka was a great success in a career recovery.
The ridiculed actor became a respected director, and his game was no longer the target of ridicule.
"Argo operation" his third full-fledged film, followed by a dark detective, "Goodbye, baby, farewell" (2007) and a Triller "City" (2010).
At the same time, this is Affleka’s first film, which does not appear in his hometown of director - Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere is related to the qualities of earlier film directors over the Hollywood standard.
And Afflek shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are happening on the streets, and when real events are being renovated, the Embassy's entrance scenes are impressive, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and the unpredictability that arise when history changes somewhere.
Afflec and his colleagues have similar effects in the falsified scenes (the fake headquarters at the Tehran market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the message did not involve many exciting scenes of film.
He's quite successful at working with this little guy, sometimes he's thinking about something -- it's not so elegant. (The cell where the American phone call prevents the impending crisis at Tehran Airport, and the runway chase is quite intrusive).
The drawback of Argo is the dispersal of the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, as the needles of the Hollywood colleagues, are really very ambitious, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleka's film lacks a little dramatic, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the production and retro-style that re-establishs the threelers of the seventies.
But it's hard.
This, however, is enough to remind one still in the known sense of living history, as well as to show how exaggerated the notions of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services are.
Air balloon inflatation, bananas and circus regulations
The portal www.bankovnipoplatsky.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to declare a competition for “the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop”.
“We have moved on to this latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies”, stated “The right” by Patrick Nager.
Among the absurdities already proposed is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
To date, women have received life insurance benefits because they are less exposed to risk for insurance companies.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be presented by people before the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place before the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU ' s controversial orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, resulting in damage to nature, as well as the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury ferries only because they contain a relatively small number of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of a chicken cage, which has resulted in significant travel of eggs this year.
The actual ban on the use of the term "junker oil" or the removal of classical lamps was also criticized.
Quality bananas must be 14 cm long.
The pan-European apparatus often decides under pressure from a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or group of States (thus, Czech Republic is now even under threat to the veto defending the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, the top-quality bananas in the European Union were to reach 14 cm in length and were not to show “anomalous curvature”.
In doing so, the European Commission was justified by the fact that it only harmonized existing fragmented national rules, which made trade more difficult.
Despite opposition from some States, the EU has still mitigated standards for fruit and vegetables, recalling that existing directives will lead to the waste of products.
Last year's EU regulation that air balloons should necessarily be given a warning that children under eight years of age cannot abuse them without adult supervision may also be a candidate for win.
The EU has applied American research according to which balloons at play are a potential cause of death for children through suffocation.
This restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 who are not allowed to blow into fair-tempered duds.
Fun ideas are also born at home.
The rule relating to European officials themselves is absurd enough: anyone who holds an official office in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, but rather say “BURM” (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatki.com portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists of the “Principle of Non-interference” (Laissez Faire), proposed for a vote, in addition to several above-mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU Regulation on the amount of food stocks in the territory of a member State.
The EU has established maximum food stocks that may be available in the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded its established levels of canned mushrooms, for which it was subject to heavy fines.
The interviewers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea and the idea of grant subsidies.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not Brussels.
"We are in a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We'll ask for compensation from the European Union," said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palace (FPPA) in autumn 2004.
He argued that there had been a high crop of grain in the country and that, as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had full warehouses to be removed.
For being far from the ports, the EU, according to Palau, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to meet the Czech Republic and organized tenders for grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for a grant were offered by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Germans (US-DEU), in particular by the villages, to make applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: An amazing order is an exception
While regulations in member States are easily criticized, EU regulatory efforts and the more effective functioning and development of the European Union are considered by many experts to merit recognition.
Experts considered that it was a serious problem to draw EU grants for projects that did not even have an indication of something common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States had achieved when discussing the budget.
It is emotional among the Czechs and that, as in other European Union countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to identify its traditional products specifically, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, retained the name "Olomauts", but "Touzem Roman", whose traditions in our country are rooted in the 19th century, our producers were to be renamed "Touzek".
Only sugar beet can be called rum, and not sugar beet.
The EU's official list of registered products, together with the world-known cheeses of “feta” and “gorgondsol”, maripan of German Lubeka or Parmsk, has already been found, for example, carlovarian droughts, the burns and trichebon carp and the Jewish hop.
Also, the trade name of the EU can be proud of the pharubic plumbine and the peacock tubes.
People want me to choose a republic, but I'm a lover, and Ocamura says.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come into the head to run for president?
I don't think I'm going to be a senator or president myself.
If there were no problems in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can't see how the country has been breaking up over the last 20 years, how thieves are here, how taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent person who's not a party, I have no other way of influencing things except by running for senator or president.
You went to the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Are you turning your backs towards the people who chose you?
I've always said I'm going to join the presidential castle fight, depending on the result of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I were to be a senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a post, a post is an instrument by which I can carry out my views.
I therefore need the greatest influence and the greatest authority.
But the challenge is not only that we're like a nation singing in our own bar or on television, but that we're ready to trample on anyone who tries to change something.
This is added to the media, which denigrate a person, and which confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was lending bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irgi Parowbek.
Let's move on to your views.
The battle for the presidential castle has begun with claims of political and criminal liability and return declarations worth more than twenty million.
To do so, it is necessary to change the law.
You do not have such powers as President, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to meet this challenge?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed to make the tour a free business, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics -- when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, he is deliberately obstructed, and this deters citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan, I have much greater potential for receiving support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it without party-to-part layouting, without looking at dogmas.
Do you think you're more right-to-right or left-to-left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that I am more of a left-wing person.
It doesn't matter to me at all - a little left or a little right.
It's important for me that we go forward.
It's not about someone on the right, it's about someone on the left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good public decision as to whether it will be proposed by the HR Committee or the GBP, and I will be just as opposed to the bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you're setting up a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
It can be called populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already in operation in the world or are being referred to by eminent experts.
But if you don't support Parliament, you'll only have slogans.
And that's what you won't do in politics for long.
Or do you think that when you go out and talk to people, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other option.
Just to convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to get them on our side so that we can achieve our own.
Had I been elected President, it would not have been a problem to organize a live television broadcast calling on the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell them why they don't want to.
If there was a strong personality that would be abused, pressure would be placed on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President -- it was a public pressure.
I'm telling you directly that I'm a lover, not a genius, and I'm not an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to defend my beliefs and beliefs.
I'm just beginning in politics, and I'm going to try and get support for most of my programme.
I am trying to move on my own; if this fails, I will end in six years and return to the private sector.
It sounds in part like Okamura has to save Czechia.
I'm no lifesaver.
I know I'm not going to do anything, so I went around a number of prominent people offering to run for Senate.
I went to the Janchure Radum, he refused a lot of work.
I also at least supported the lead investigation by journalist Jan Laurenttsov, who discovered the fraud of light fuel oil products.
I have put forward my candidature because people are really unhappy, but now I feel I'm on the balance.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, and most of those who went chose to be representatives of the Islamist.
Only two of us are independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate so that the changes would be difficult.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, such as the direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to test the purity of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have any money for it.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, but there's only 20,000 kroner in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, but what about your own business?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a site in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, a collection of works of art of about 10 million, Aston-Martin of 3.5 million, and Scod of Superb per million, and a few million in the account.
By the way, I came to Aston-Martin because it was my little dream -- I always liked James Bond, who was driving a car, was a galanist with women, and at the same time was struggling against palate and lawlessness.
You ride Aston Martina, own property for 60 million, and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want your own money to invest in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors indicates that my programme is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign from my pocket.
The cost of the campaign will essentially cover my senatorial salary.
But I wouldn't live on that money, for example, if I couldn't pay my son for an English school that cost 30,000 a month.
If only I wanted to earn money, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
So you're going to do business next to make it possible for you to live?
Didn't you say you'd cut it down?
But it doesn't depend on the paycheck.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the manager of the tourist agency in the spring.
People would like me to be the crook that will keep the republic.
But I have to live for something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, did you get used to getting monthly?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, I'll keep getting it.
And if I were to become president, my entrepreneurship would be over.
You'll find a full interview in the Saturday issue of the Right.
MVRDV architects prove that the actual adventures are not only imaginations - for example, Speikinisse and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photographs
"I find this building to be fun, it looks futuristic, at last we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, who's an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has an Internet, an iPad, and e-books.
No one's voluntarily going to such old-fashioned libraries now, right?
The spicenisse, an unusual sleeping town near Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest educational level in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this scourge several years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fabricated bridges, which are shown on the euro notes, in the form of picturesque miniaters from the ferrobeton.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city's fathers realized that they had the only opportunity to outdo the statistics: building a library here!
Vini Maas of the Rotterdam architectural office of MVRDV, the master of bold column diagrams and the author of acute, sometimes cynical, constructions, took on the task of being intrusive and appeared on a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a smile on the face.
And while the jury looked around and shook their shoulders, the impudent Maas removed from his original gift a pyramid of size and concluded his speech in defense of his project with the words: "Dear citizens!"
Here's my offer, "The Book Mountain" in Speikenisse, the so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of a rehabilitation project which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residences and a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second award of the 2012 "The Best Library of the Netherlands".
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Wood Competition.
Thus, the shallow suburbs, which had previously been unable to offer anything other than a post - Modernist pedestrian zone, and an amazingly unappreciative town, whose white facades point to the idea of a milk plant, became richer for one modern work of architecture.
But above all, in Speikenisse, the first public building in the history of this town came into existence for cultural purposes.
A Long Road to a Book
First impression: The book Eldorado under the cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the middle of a mountain mass, because true worshipers of architecture and reading prefer to explore this area on foot.
A glass - light and light - on all sides, fireed bricks fields and elegant street lights create an infallible sense of public urban space.
The urban environment has been restored perfectly.
The look is reluctant to look for the benches, dogs, and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere -- books, books, books.
"Of course the bookshelves are standing along the facades, and in the middle there is a large, dark room, usually uncomfortable and disembodied," says Vini Maas.
We put the classic configuration of the space on our head and pulled out the reading area from the outside.
The interior of the book Mountain is used skillfully: offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities are located in the centre.
The black bookshelves that serve as the separation wall, the parapets, and the ladders are particularly welcome.
Their appearance, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and construction engineers are lost in guesswork, which is unknown material.
“We have sought to work with secondary materials”, explains Yop Traubest, project manager of the Speikenisse community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And one day at an agricultural enterprise in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and fields of the Netherlands, artificial fibrous fibrous thickness material has been used as a base.
It's cheap and time-saving.
The thin textile serves one or two seasons and can then be discarded.
For the library, this is a canvas -- for the first time in these amounts -- was compressed in a panel of four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastics (KLP) turns into dark, homogeneous, solid material, with a smell a little like a new car and a little cross.
There are 105 steps at the top.
A person who overcomes the path nearly 500 metres long will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch rafters and wood fig trees in the pots.
They care about the atmosphere, especially the proper humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Cost per new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," says Troublast.
The heat of the ground is used for heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cap, even on clear days, the sun is only short - lived inside.
Large wooden farms, located perpendicularly to the glass facade, provide shade and take over most of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic steering curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned earlier, had already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also here.
And also a traditional Chinese medical teacher, Cynthia Godard, who called Bukenberg "the spirit of Speykenisse, which has been missing for a long time."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each householder received an invitation to donate a book from his own congregation.
These books were supposed to be empty on the shelves of the yet uncompleted library -- at the time, there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are on top.
"There's nothing worse than a half-blown library," says architect Vini Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation now, every resident has some connection to this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for jewelry.
MVRDV has thus been able to meet the royal challenge, which is called the creation of identity at the professional fergon.
Spikeniss wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's only the starting point to build identity.
Sabo: "The Germans have a more important role to play."
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on U.S. - European relations, Berlin balances on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the voting.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be wary of its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position does not support either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without speaking too critically towards Israel.
Germany also abstained in the voting on the imposition of the no-fly zone during the March 2011 uprising in Libya.
As a result, NATO has made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The point is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, from the policy that the United States so-called governs to the German foreign policy itself.
The additional complexity of the situation is that Europeans do not have an agreed one-size-fits-all policy.
So the Germans are back between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're only beginning to see their role, but they're on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy by France or Great Britain.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
This is a willingness to adopt a position that is independent of the position of the United States or European partners in its national interest.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. exports and linkages with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are very different from those of other major States, and therefore Germany must protect its own interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It therefore needs to be careful not to offend the public and elites in Arab countries.
Either way, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to this, it's not a completely unilateral connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German calculations.
Has Germany damaged its relationship with the United States by refraining from taking important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even acquire some respect in this way.
It is a sign that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that it should be considered with its interest.
In Europe, there are differing views on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, it was clear that it was in favour of the veto.
Are there differences between the United States and many European States?
Because of American domestic policies, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has an adequate understanding of the European position.
But because of the local political situation, the Government cannot take that position openly.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as large as they always appear.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not pleased with Netanyahu.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of a key partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes this situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a single, uncontroversial European policy, but this is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot act as part of a broader approach and are forced to act instead based only on their own vision of the situation.
That's how they get off the euro.
I think Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position in the future.
Clearly, this is not easy for Germany, even because of connection with Israel.
The subject was always sensitive.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany saw itself as an important international player, would it not take on a truly central role?
Or is Germany still hard to take the lead?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to this; it is still always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, has always been hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis -- every time Germany takes on an important role, a wide range of anti-German feelings manifest themselves.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and opinions, and this is not easy.
So the U.S. influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at this point the EU is not filling this vacuum, then who is left?
The Germans just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, it makes you feel uncomfortable or unloved, it's life!

Trademark Security in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned trademark, Polo Ralf Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from which it is established.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a claim.
But it is not clear then whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"Foreigners are increasingly finding it difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, attorney for Taylor Wessing, specializing in the violation of trademark rights in the Far East.
My desk shows up every week on a new case of this kind.
It is sufficient for the simulators to add just a couple of letters to obtain the right to register their trademarks.
Thus, Gucci makes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, it is possible to register the Prada-Kny.
German enterprises, such as Puma sports manufacturer, are legally copied in the same way.
Pattloch opens a folder with records from the Trademark Registration Department in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered a trademark of Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used the name of the fashion house Hermegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are the world ' s champions of copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities, there are multi-story supermarkets that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
However, Pattloch ' s cases are different, and according to instructions from his attorneys, he is opposed to the fact that Chinese enterprises are given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere from the trademark registration department.
The Chinese call it "bun minpai", a stamp passenger.
The word is associated with "ban dacouan".
That's what they call women hunting for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not accept the blame
"It harms business, it must be fought," Pattloch is convinced.
"The brand is washed, the unique situation is lost, the image is suffering very much."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated to be millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, with sales of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to obtain the removal of doubtful records in the trademark register, and this is costly.
The process may last up to nine years, with a vague outcome.
Pattloch describes cases in which the court rejected claims, since after a long time the contested name became a “market reality”.
If the claimant is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarator because he damaged his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also well-known cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction manufacturer Sany, an enterprise that had recently purchased a concrete company called Putzmeiser.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Gheely, the buying Volvo company originally used a blue and white logo that looked like BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Lacoste’s fashionable products were lost in China to amateurs from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had a famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities don't think they're guilty.
The registration of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that difficulties were encountered in 2010 owing to the shortage of personnel and equipment.
But last year, there was a “return from emergency in the working process to normal”.
Thus, the number of pending objections cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending proceedings within the department.
It's worth it.
As is so often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received over 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is the record, and it means that China has taken the tenth consecutive lead in the list of new registrations worldwide, reporting to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were paid.
To simplify this means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 Yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth much more than that, as the case of the German Family Enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the competitor has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarator.
The Germans have achieved that their illicit manufacture of counterfeit automobiles has been eliminated.
However, the simulator secured Chinese trading rights for Freudenberg.
This was an omission of its own, since the names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Ventsler, chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO Trademark Registration Department rejected the Munich claim.
True, in both of the following Freudenbergs won, but the opposing side is still fighting.
You have to be okay.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Ventsler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."
Domestic costs are unlikely to be accounted for, and the company’s archives have had to look at even acts of centuries ago to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the other party a “great six-digit amount in euros” for settlement.
"It's clear how expensive it is for us," says Ventsler.
Even Europe is threatened with the dangers of the Far East.
That is, if the simulators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Fredenberg for shoes and leather products.
The concert had long ceased production in these areas, but had been able to prevent registration.
"We need to be clear," says Ventsler.
Both he and Pattloh counsel recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks; rather, foreigners should “all that is worth protecting in any way, to register also in China”, said Ventsler.
Otherwise, it can cost more than registration.
It is true that if Freudenberg loses the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposite party license fees for his own name, explains Ventsler.
Otherwise we'll be expelled from the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Flooding, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, Imbongi's chorus is rehearsing, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of the relationship that has traveled more than 8,733 miles [8733 km]
First, the cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies ’ boats, and men’s buttons pick up the wires on the parking floor and quickly find it.
One or two or three or four.
It is only then that the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor, and soprano - slowly grow. They attack, charm, and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumped out of his mother's shoes when he leads them with flexible and vivid gestures.
Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Khor Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty members of the chorus from 23 to 69 years of age, from a geneticist to a nobleman, attended the rehearsal.
Om Obani is a difficult thing, and every voice of the chorus has its own text, and in a very foreign language: Zulusian, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
According to Uaids, the United Nations AIDS programme estimates that there are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Estitheni, Voices for Africa has found chiefs in Germany.
Of them, 70 are attending schools to prepare for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the lead.
It guarantees children school money, school uniforms and daily hot lunch at Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means a storyteller or a admirer.
They don't talk on the bantu in this room, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the chorus has been learning songs in this foreign, soft language, and occasionally has even brought them back to the place where they first appeared — south of Africa.
After all, there is a village of Esitjani, which depends on the voice of the German chorus, located some 8,733 miles [8733 km] away from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland.
Forty per cent Infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still living in simple mud huts and straws, many of whom are children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the HF virus.
In Esitheni, a minority of Swaziland ' s health is reflected: the highest level of HIV infection, the world ' s lowest life expectancy, according to UNICEF data.
Circumcision of extreme flesh among men, which has provenly reduced the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland ' s population have a immunodeficiency virus and death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
The Khor opened the village on a joint mission to Africa in the spring of 2005, but previously the people of the Imghan saw many children on the streets who were not only concerned with their parents but also simply not only with food, clothing and education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
It was first a private commitment by individual participants to send the child to school for several euros a year and to allow him to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the chorus founded Voices for Africa, which has almost professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Esitjan since then.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorium) are classified as bacterial STIs.
HIV, human papilloma virus, genetic herpes and hepatitis are common viruses.
Lobby pedicules and scabies refer to parasitic STDs.
What are the main groups affected?
Cyphilis and gonorrhea are found mostly among men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koha Institute is of the view that at least four out of every five cases of Syphilis registered in Germany are the result of sexual intercourse between men.
For heterosexual adults, common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candosis, gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections are from this group.
The incidence of chlamidic infections among young people is much higher than among other groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have frequent human papilloma virus encounters among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to be registered.
Syphilis disease, according to Robert Koch Institute, has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What are the symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases?
In infectious diseases, genital mutilation, urination complaints, secretions, stomach pains, and bubbles or sealing may arise.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain or other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Stopovers can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
In part, sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact infections and close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend a regular survey, especially with frequent sexual partner changes.
In the case of early diagnosis, most of the STIs can be cured and remote effects can be avoided.
The chief, the donation, and not least the honorariums for the performances of a chorus throughout Germany allow for something to be gathered.
"We've all sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjan," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is administered by the Tsou Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also makes sure that orphans are well organized, for example, by one of her grandmothers.
Gogos, as it is called on the Zulu old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, provide a shelter over their heads, and ensure that children in uniform appear in class on time each day.
Those who have no family come to Hanyishila's shelter, a single woman who receives wages from association, as well as two cooks who prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chickens, and jointly with the American Health Organization PSI organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease that is so evident throughout the country prefers to be deeply silent.
A King With 14 Wives
"AlDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's connected to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country where the king has 14 wives officially.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-sanctioned lifestyle is also responsible for the rapid spread of the HH virus in previous years.
But it also lies with wanderers who are spreading the virus throughout the country.
Free condoms are literally at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're hardly used.
Another culture is flesh."
To maintain little support for cultural exchange, Ibmoni's chorus travels every two to three years across sub-Saharan Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, a spirit of war, confidence and a black self-awareness that many people in the southern tip of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in black - this recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even happens to cause tears to the eyes of the harsh border guards.
The trip also always takes place in Esitjani, where singers visit children.
Although a small village is difficult to find on the map, it is more known in the Etsulveni Valley.
"Go to Esitheni, there's light," people here say.
And after an 873-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the singing singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is burning here too.
NASA is opening ice on Mercury.
The Messinger probe found evidence that Mercury had ice on the planet.
Ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 metres.
NASA’s space agency has proved that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by the three studies published on Thursday in the special magazine Science.
The Messinger Sund found evidence that the shadowed region of the planet was covered with ice.
Its thickness must be less than six inches [30 cm], possibly up to 20 metres.
It is likely that water occurs with comets or perhaps asteroids that have encountered Mercury.
No one connects the opening of ice to the existence of life on the planet, says probe leader Sean Solomon.
The temperature at Mercury can be as high as 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life came to other places in the solar system.
The probe, telescopes and small robots, such as “Fenix”, are not visible to Earth’s inhabitants.
From time to time, they send images to Earth — small eyes in endless form.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Cerera.
Like Pluto, who looks around the Sun for Neptune, Ceres, by a new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, is not a “planet”.
This infrared photograph of Spitzer represents the “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars as blue points, it is more difficult to identify pink “new” stars in the star circle.
This region of star formation - scientists call it unromantically W5 - opened by the Spicer telescope at the Cassipe constellation, 6,500 light-years away.
This superheated heat of a dying star took a picture of NASA's Spitzer telescope.
A donutlike ring consists of material that the star has thrown in the process of dying.
In the Trifid giant nebulae removed 4,500 light years from the earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of a galactic maternity ward.
The Star Cluster of Pleiades, also called “Seven Sisters”, can be seen at night with an unarmed eye.
Of course, colors are better with the telescope.
As the red eye flashes the observer's nebulae on this infrared picture.
It is situated 700 light years away at the constellation of the Vodola.
The descent to the earthly continent brought this nebula to the title "Northern America".
A combination of normal and infrared photographs provides an express colour transmission.
This new star has only been photographed with the infrared telescope Spitzer's infrared sensors in all its beauty.
Saturn and his ring: As they emerged, one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps these are the fragments of Saturn's moon, which disappeared unsurpassedly 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most clear images of the Hubble telescope: the Vodorve galaxy
Depending on the color of the spiral galaxies, the images are transformed into actual works of art.
The photo published by the European Southern Observatory shows the distant trifide nebula at the shooter's constellation for several thousand light years.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (three-dimensional, three-separate), since the dark strips of dust divide the cleft heart of the cradle of stars into three parts.
In the constellation of the Serpent, astronomers photographed the harbinger of a space collision: 400 million light - years away from the Earth, the nucleus of the two merging galaxies are moving towards each other and will inevitably be encountered.
It's the birth of a star in the HST telescope that took off in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Someone who doesn't like technical cuts might call it the South Cemetery Wheel.
A photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of Iris's nebulae at the Cepheus constellation.
The haze away of 1,400 light-years consists of dust particles that range from 10 to 100 times less than normal domestic dust.
This image was made up of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed the NASA HST Space Telescope.
The great spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This star nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The starship constantly creates new stars.
It's a star cloud connected to the Rosette Nebula, and it's also constantly creating new stars -- 5,000 light years away from Earth.
There's no dust in this brightly shining galaxy with a little black hole, just gas.
Researchers assume that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when hydrogen was mostly present in the universe.
Our view of the universe: critical telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem, even before Galileo Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown more and more and the space available to them is deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, namely, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory at San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The star depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., a larger binocular telescope has been installed.
It allows you to look into space by means of two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
"Gran Telescopio Canarias" has a giant internal device - the diameter of a mirror alone is 10.4 metres.
The Great South African Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce cost.
However, in diameter it reaches about 11 meters.
Inadequate low-cost design: the telescope is firmly attached at the vertical angle, limiting its mobility.
The Hobbie Eberley telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
It's a special feature: a high light-separating ability.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the largest world telescopes.
Using radiotelescope in Aresíbo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
Radiotelescope is 305 metres in diameter.
By participating in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing his computing power.
View of European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Andes of Chile
There's a "Strategic Telescope" that's completely consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors allow even the average infrared spectrum to be lit in a visual tube.
Also planned is the installation of a European “Strategic Telescope” in the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror must be spread over a whole of 40 feet [42 m], and it will be made up of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea Hawaiian volcano were considered to be the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors 10 metres in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into the sky with the help of the Subara and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a diameter mirror of 30 metres, should appear on Mauna Kea.
Here they can enjoy illustrations.
However, the most important species from outer space are the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it has provided pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system, especially those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 planet candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
Photographs of recent preparations for the Kepler Space Telescope have been printed.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space no earlier than 2018 on board Arian 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest there's ice in the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence of this, since Messinger is turning closer to the northern pole of the planet.
Irrigated measurements for decades indicated that Mercury had ice.
Thanks to the Messinger probe launched in 2004, the first to rotate around Mercury, scientists are now convinced.
Drink oil every day - and live to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are of respected age.
There's even a museum for a long time.
A search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are of respected age.
There's even a museum for a long time.
A search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be still relatively young.
A trip through the Talish Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
A minibus is pouring down the windy road past dense forests of hills, billows, and simple peasant houses.
Everything's so green and bright, you might think you're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost country of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is only a few kilometres from here.
There are Talyshs, one of the people of the Caucasus, who knows a little about unless they speak beautifully on Farsi and Azerbaijani and have a long life.
The end point is Léric.
The small town is surrounded by too heavy austere architecture of Soviet times, which is completely out of harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too exhausting.
It takes eight hours for a 323 - mile [323 km] road to travel, as it has only one lane.
The mythical wealth to which the country owes oil to the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the province.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lérica.
"In May Baku is famous for the European song festival, and next year we'll have the festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulaev.
She's the director of the Long Age Museum, probably the only one in the world.
There's a biography of about eight dozen of these places, which are over 100 years old, and Fatulaev points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the spore star of the museum is Chaban Shirley Muslumov, who is estimated to be 168 years old.
No birth certificates, however.
And given that the oldest person whose age was confirmed by documents was 122 years old, the age of Mousslumov appears to be extremely questionable.
"He was born here in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children at the age of 136, who allegedly had a daughter.
So did Mouslum chaban add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholtz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about the long-term residents in Central Asia.
“A remarkable number of people of advanced age can also be found in certain parts of China, Japan or the Junza Valley in Pakistan,” said Scholtz, “a very large number of older people also live on Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of documents, the age of science cannot be confirmed because there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of crushed oil
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area of Lérica are strikingly often reaching the age of the Bible.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age living here.
Why are there so many long-livers here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Muhimzade explains this by the special genes of fattened.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the other hand, believes it's food.
Tasteers like meat, bread, and milk products most, and many drink on a glass of pop butter every day, but it is unlikely that such a high-caloric diet can be healthy from a nutritional point of view.
In Chengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lérica, Rubab Mirzoev lives.
At 97 years of age, it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaev, who claims that she has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter, which she's not tired of running up and down.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of the sons and daughter of Mirzaeva, who have long had their grandchildren.
There are also two babies in the vicinity.
Guests prepare tea in the kitchen, which is served in typical raffle glasses of the Armud.
Mirzaev has perfectly flat and strong white teeth, under her headscarves, she conceals long, dark-rumpled cosmos, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so they never fell and saved my color.
"And I've never used a shampoo," says Mirzaev.
Monthly pension is sufficient for life
She always ate only things that grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought food in a store in my entire life.
Then she tells of her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But it's better when Heidar Aliyev's "loving father" stands at the wheel.
Propaganda is not often heard in an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled by the country as dictator, in Azerbaijan hardly knows the boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son Ilham took over.
However, there is no poverty among Azerbaijanis.
230 Manats (approximately the same amount of euros) Mirzaev receives monthly pensions, for local conditions it is an amount for which to live well.
And perhaps the long-growing son of Mirzaeva is also entitled, "The elderly in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in large families, loved ones, surrounded by care and happiness.
It's no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human rights” is not found in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal a deep division of the country.
The future Constitution, based on the Shariah, met with violent opposition.
The Egyptian president did not go shopping for the Paphos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success lies with my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but especially to Christian Coptics, liberals, educated Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
For all of them, who are still hopelessly separated from the lost opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state in the Nile for the mercy of powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohammed Murcy, almost apologizing, said that he temporarily cut the competence of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competence “to save the revolution”.
But what really wants to save a 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate in South California at the American University is not clear to Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of its power?
In fact, 234 articles were able to be carried in the night of the 15-hour run, with obstacles to an Islamicist assembly of 100 participants, which is partly feared.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that judicial proceedings are based on “the principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and remains an interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use vague language and the legal fluffet resulting from it to better interpret Sharia.
At least one new article suggests this: in all cases involving Sharia, Al-Ahar University, the country ' s most important Islamic institution, which enjoys great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be involved for the Council.
This should not, but may mean, that the clergy look after the law, which would in fact have resulted from the restriction of the judiciary.
Much of the draft Constitution is subject to interpretation
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians must remain within the military court.
These courts served to suppress the opposition during the Mubarak period.
Up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody after the overthrow of the dictator.
As the draft also states, the State must protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “support its morality and values”.
This is legal in such a way that government institutions can control even the contents of movies and literature by means of this article.
This means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article directly establishes equality between men and women.
Yet another forbids the insult and disparaging of the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what such an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful whether the wording is prohibited “injury of people”.
Will there be enough cartoons or jokes about the president?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this draft, which Murcy proposes for signature and which, he said, “very soon” will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The Revolution Is Returned."
The opposition against the superiority of Islamists has been emerging for several weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unity on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we shall win," said Hamdin Sabbachi, third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution was “in the dump of history”.
Through Twitter short news service, he accused Murcia's supporters of wanting to lead "Latch Against Democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and drop it," said oppositioner Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged," quoted the Egyptian media as the opposition policy of Khaled Ali.
Many judges also indicated that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"Coran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square, but in the wake of mass prayers on the other side of Neal before Cairo University.
It brought together a large number of women under the cover and followers of the Salafites who shouted: “The nation demands the application of God's law”.
They demanded of Murcia, "Clean the country," and they assured them, "Coran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area in which everything began has triggered a state of almost civil war.
Murcia's followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
Muslim Brothers stated that both opponents and supporters of the draft Constitution had been loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide from the electoral urn in which the country should go.
Most of the Islamic project is considered to have been resolved.
“The term `human rights' is never mentioned”
Hafiz Abu Saeda was furious at this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOPR) defended Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or brought to trial at Mubarak.
Not because he shared their world view, but because human rights were indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
Now, the words "human rights" never appear in a new constitution, he regrets talking to Welt am Sonntag.
Murcia ' s increased influence on all three branches of government in the State is disappointing to counsel.
These measures constitute clear attacks on the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“In place of strengthening the civilian State, the de facto President has abolished it”, he regrets.
After all, without civil society organizations democracy cannot function.
Saida feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, who is looking at the ideological struggle of points on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
A payment can be made for that.
A demon on Tahrir Square warns, "You're creating a monster that you can't control."
Norwegian seashell: the stupidest fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway have one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also throughout the world.
Perhaps the mystery of the country's success is somehow related to the local passion for one extremely fishy dish?
Take a couple of vulture slices of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're going to have a reabsorbing smell of the seashell, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours away from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but there's an insatiable natural smell in the air.
Rackfisk is a trout from salt and wanders in water for a year, depending on which shower to obtain.
As the bags are packed and coldened, Norwegian crowds gather for a festival in Fagernes, dedicated to the same, let's say, an exciting dish.
“They eat raw meat, and they drink a few acavite, a local dark vodka,” explains Havard Halvarsen, a local firefighter in the profession and at the co-location of the "Rakfiska General" who leads the festival.
All around us, people eat small - sized fish and drink it with plenty of alcohol.
"Someone likes aquatics more than ruffishes," said Havard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'm trying a couple pieces.
If you can bring a piece under your nose, it's not so bad, it's not much different from the portion of land you've been carrying on a bus for a long time.
Cancer is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, a time of poverty, when even before refrigerators came up, fish were buried in hermetically closed barrels of salty water in autumn.
Then, in a deep winter, when the fish had been well and thoroughly fertilized, it was taken out and, with the help of alcohol, was used for food.
In memory of the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly, with more than 13 per cent of immigrants being employed in jobs, high wages and a well-developed social security system.
The inhabitants of Sweden (an ancient rival, and not so long ago a much more affluent neighbor) come to work here.
Cancer is perceived as an important symbol, a temporary one, although several vicious elements of Norway ' s past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it's all expensive -- a small beer glass or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14).
Norway rarely appeared in the world's news, and most of the country's inhabitants seemed to be doing so.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Braywick, a racist and right-wing extremist who killed and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without referring to his name, the terrorist is referred to as “the incident of 22 July”.
Norwegians find it very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens has been capable of such atrocities and killings.
Norway ' s current prosperity is based on the growth (from the beginning of the seventieths) of one of the world ' s largest oil and gas industries.
"How come oil isn't the only reason we're prosperous," says Anna, our waitress, which is a woman with long hairs and amazingly blue eyes, a Nordian well-being.
We are a people like you, reasonful.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks great English.
We don't like to show up, we're not bragging.
Norway is very careful about its oil, and most of the oil and gas revenues are invested in a special fund established for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone had ruined money they didn't have, Norway carefully calculated all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and go camp in the summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's cancer," she adds, with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow waiting for some food - I'm done with the seashell.
Here's a burger with osteoporous meat. It's definitely exotic. It's delicious juice.
But in the evening, there's still more fish waiting for us than ever before.
In my hotel, a special exercise is held on the subject of cancer, during which the best or perhaps the most aromatic fish is determined by the voting.
There's a direct telephony showing the head in the bar, surrounded by seashell plates.
It's like a song contest called "Eury."
"So, Tor-Jürgen, what is your estimate of the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Havard, here's our estimate."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off the chair, maybe taking over a caviar.
Or perhaps by smelling the fish.
The President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nieto, has a hard time starting a career.
While Mexico's newly elected President, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant, invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
The traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly miserable state right now.
The city was overloaded by transport and good time, and steel barriers had been built from Monday, cutting several key roads to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting out of the suburbs, but to prevent the protestors from getting to the parliamentary building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Henrique Peña Nieto, will wear a presidential link and accept the country's squabbles of government.
He's faced with a challenge.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance under the administration of Filipe Calderón, which was now in power, but the country had been embroiled in the war against drugs, which had taken some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government expresses its readiness to the people of Mexico to fight violence”, Mr. Penya Nieto reported earlier this week to President Barack Obama of the United States in the White House Oval Office.
I intend to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto, President of the United States, developed his political career as Governor of his native state, Mexico City.
In his homeland, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital, views were divided about a new leader.
A straight-line person
In Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
The inhabitants deserve the revitalization of tourism, the development of resorts and the construction of infrastructure.
One of the new highways built by Mr. Penya Nieto is available to the city, which stands out as different from the roads with the swabs and pits that were earlier built on this site.
The tablets with its name hang on the modern gymnasium building and on the impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We link our hopes for real and serious change to him”, says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman from Peña Nieto, an institutional and revolutionary party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, particularly in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous power, the PRI party was expelled in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Oliver admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos Presidential Palace, the party has placed great hopes on Enrique Penya Nieto.
In addition, he refutes the allegations of irrevocability raised by the new President of the opposition.
He is very direct and very committed to the realization of his vision for the future of the country.
It's a great statesman, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkojotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the paved streets of Valle de Bravo.
Covered under highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
The problems in the municipality are also severe in nature.
Earlier this year, troops had been engaged in the reconciliation of drug-trafficking gangs in those areas, and violence against women was particularly severe.
Several dozen bodies of killed women have been found in the desert near an extensive landfill in the last two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico City during Mr. Peña Nieto ' s Governorate, a figure significantly higher than that in Ciudad Juárez, a notoriously violent city whose name has become familiar when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to the opponents, Mr. Peña Nieto, at best it could be said that he had been unable to deal with the issue of killing women during his tenure as governor.
In the worst case, his administration had been accused of totally ignoring the problem.
A woman who lives in a concrete house like most houses in this cluttered area, Irinea Bundia has difficulty keeping her tears down by showing me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
Mariana committed suicide in 2010, according to an official version.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her roommate.
"When I got to her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed away before," she recalled.
There were signs that she had been beaten and that her body had already been beckoned.
Mariana's mother tells this story, and her daughter's portrait looks at us from the wall, where he's hanging next to the crucifixion, where there's only one word: justice.
That was what they said had been denied to the family.
"The state officials treated me like an old gossiper, an unsatisfied peace breaker.
They want people to just accept everything they say and give up.
But that's wrong, and you can't do it, especially when there's so many irregularities and shortcomings around you," she says.
On Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on heavy responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by crimes of violence, and the new President has promised to make this issue a priority during his reign.
"I hope that he will be exactly the same President as the Governor," said Oliver, a congressman from Valle de Bravoo of the PRI Party.
However, that is what the victims ' families in Ciudad-Nass fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, he claims.
The prosecutors try to refute Bradley Manning ' s allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning ' s stay in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence demands that the case be closed on the grounds that the conditions of Manning ' s detention were harsh.
The U.S. Private Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not avail himself of the many opportunities to file a complaint about the ill-treatment he claimed he had had to undergo while in a military prison.
During cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meida, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Feyn stated that the records of weekly visits to Manning by prison authorities during their nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
Cross-examined as part of the defence ' s motion to terminate Manning ' s case, on the grounds that his conditions of detention were cruel and punishment in themselves was sufficient, was held the day after Manning had stated that he had intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
The resource of WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of information.
During the Friday hearing, Prosecutor Feyn and Manning reviewed the reports that had been filled by the authorities following visits to Manning while he was in Quantico prison, where he was in strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he valued the treatment by the prison administration as “precious” and that the general conditions of detention were “very professionally organized”.
The reports under consideration do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, although Manninga was directly asked about his conditions of detention, according to Feyn.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concern about these problems and that his representatives who visited him had discussed these problems with him and had stated that they would be dealt with but not recorded in writing.
"They recorded no problems" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise the subject in a conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a meeting of a commission dealing with suicide intentions that he had expressed in writing several months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to be removed from the injury prevention regime and eased conditions of detention.
Military leaders explained that the limited regime of detention was lower than that of supervision in order to prevent suicide had been introduced for the protection of the prisoner as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that everything is okay with me to stop the injury prevention regime... so that my life level will improve, from my point of view," explained Manning.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait and that he had lost consciousness once because of intense heat.
He explained that it is very difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is handled and what is going on in the outside world.
"My world has complained to Camp Arifjan's base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cage."
While in Quantico, he said that he spent most of his time in a small cell, at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day, all alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only mattresses, blankets, flosses, a few pieces of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move because sleep or even lie down during day - to - day periods prohibited regulations.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly flogging the light coming out of his cell.
If the guards did not see his face as he turned around in bed at night, he was said to have been waked up and forced to turn on his back.
Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manninga was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about the statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners for a morning inspection.
Manning stated that it was not possible to cover the blanket during the inspection.
In response to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should throw away blankets that could cover himself, but admitted that no one had directly ordered him to leave.
On Thursday, Manning stated that he had been forced to sleep naked last night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was no danger to himself.
Manning reported that he had told the officer that he could use the rubber of the cowards or the Smits to hurt himself, but didn't do it.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, Splendants and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to endure while in detention and would significantly reduce the length of his detention if Manning was found guilty by a military court, which was due to commence proceedings at the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that it was planning to suggest that Manning should be found guilty of less serious crimes and that other charges should be challenged as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of detainees with the strictest possible regime.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegal promotion of Internet disclosure, transmission of information relating to national defence and abduction of State property or documents.
If he is convicted of all counts of indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of a Mexican American.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of their lack of capacity to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the country’s inhabitants of difficult times.
Reuben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin divide between two cultures.
During my recent visit to Mexico City, I walked through the entrance corridor, approached the border zone, and stood still.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (aliens).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I was called a Mexican for the rest of my life.
It's just a conditional name like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
Later on, I came up with a complicated design called "Mexicoian American."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the speakers of the language, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and took turns for Extranjos.
I remembered that story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met President Obama.
The issues on the agenda were common to the meetings of the presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto was eager to speak of the recovery of the Mexican economy, which would enable Mexicans to remain in Mexico with the same success instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and establish a North American trading block like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and old-fashioned issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States had invaded Mexico and had forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory under the arm of a rifle.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not for minutes, and they see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only up to a U.S. statesman to speak of criticism in Mexico, in the press and among the elites of Mexican society, that there are complaints that Americans are violating the sovereignty of neighbours.
And the descendants of Montesuma are vindictive.
Mexico's relationship with more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States is most complex.
You want to talk about offenses?
That's enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in that country, and those who don't.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Feniks, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin were only for one reason: at some point in their family history, someone -- father or grandfather -- was unable to realize himself in Mexico and had to travel north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a particular type -- striped, uneducated, poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico this is not what they see.
Today, our lives are the essence of the American dream, we have learned from good schools and we have good jobs, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to regard as its own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same way.
They see in us a reminder of the humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as undeserved Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind a silk curtain right now, finding life in the United States, but losing our spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans -- Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Americans of Mexican origin are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my fellow Mexican Americans do not feel attached to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstin.
When you get the best from two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during my visit, as if our relationship was already not sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as ambassadors of Mexico and represent her interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how it is great to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It won't work.
Too many insults in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not think that this country is so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unable to forgive the way they dealt with Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still offended by the way they treated their relatives in Mexico most recently.
Yeah.
Perhaps we have more in common than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas can be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
The next round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are in vain.
It has been said that there have been routine, wanton disputes over who started the first; many buildings have been turned into ruins; over 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis, have been killed; for the first time in the conflict from Gaza Strip, rockets fell in the vicinity of Israel ' s capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, while Israelis and Palestinians have been hopelessly linked to their long-standing conflict, the Middle East has been transformed.
This can be seen in various ways, but the events of the Arab Spring have taken place in a violent storm, and Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay away from the vortex that rocked the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons for hoping to break this deadly impasse.
War Without Wins
At first glance, the situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the cease-fire, which was signed on 21 November, was to be implemented, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the militia on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamic movement, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, claim that they forced Israel to retreat despite their losses.
Despite the fact that some group leaders had been destroyed and 1.7 million had been blocked in one of the most populated and troubled corners of the world, Israel had failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamic movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new influential and rich friends.
The re-emerging Turkish regional leader, who was once Israel's closest ally among the Muslim countries, expressed support for Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
The embittered Hamas supporters claim the establishment of an Islamist semi-monthly Israeli, from Lebanon in the north, where Hizbollah ' s paramilitary group reigns, to Syria, where the increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad ' s authority, and further to Jordan, where the king ' s authorities threaten Hamas ' s allies.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region has taken place on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populated and important Arab country, Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood movement was strengthened under President Mohammed Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 30 years and had been overthrowed in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas support.
The Muslim brothers, on the other hand, are an organization much like Hamas and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic premises, Hamas can become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the hard line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
Hamas was recruited in a military sense.
Israel's Iron dome missile system has justified the cost of its establishment and has successfully destroyed many of Hamas's rockets launched.
Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its steadfast position; many European countries also blamed the beginning of the last round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly under the Government of Binyamina Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although approximately 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004 by rockets fired from Gaza, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly through the wall entering the West Bank of the Jordan River, a significant part of an unrecognized Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions in terms of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party Likud, in preparation for the 22 January elections, has been merged with more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Liberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of trying to make Palestinians and to give them their own State?
If they were given all authority in the West Bank, would they not start firing missiles from there towards Israel, as they were gathering them in the Gaza Strip?
It's best to keep them behind the wall and severely suppress any attempt to raise their heads.
The hard line may win; however, their calculations may be denied in the Arab spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be their domestic problems.
Israel's defence budget is greater than all its Arab neighbours combined.
Warfare with a regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursi, who worked with Barak Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, to a minimum, take into account the long-term implications of its policies.
As democratic changes take place in the Arab countries, the denial of the right to self-determination of Palestinians constitutes a time bomb that will explode sooner or later in the territories occupied by Israel, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression was already undermining the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension — the growth of the Arab population — only exacerbated those problems.
The bloody operations carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas must be paid for by the growing frustration of the international community.
Both sides need external momentum
There remains the only solution that is repeatedly called upon by sound representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world, and our newspaper: the formation of two States and Israeli concessions in exchange for security.
There is hope, not too impressive in the short term, that a ceasefire will enable other countries to have a more effective impact on the parties to conflict.
Egypt, which is long overdue for the decision to stop arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has a more beneficial position than ever to persuade Hamas to recognize the boundaries of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than the forthcoming vote at the United Nations, which could result in recognition of the virtual State of Palestine.
President Obama also had a role to play in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he has never submitted his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to demonstrate his reluctance to join the issue.
This is a disastrously shortsighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Uniform Packing Act for cigarettes entered into force.
Smoking warnings and images of disease - stricken parts of the body are contrasted with those of the lush green boxes, which are the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first Australian law on single-type packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products has come into force in international practice, replacing logos and different stamps with the same box of obsolescence and olives, with a thick picture of children affected by disease and images whose health is damaged by their parents ' smoking.
In addition to the various images and inscriptions that warn against the harm of smoking, the only difference between packages that are necessarily introduced from this Sabbath is the names of stamps that are printed in the same small type.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for the packaging of tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to prevent young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion.
Such a decision was based on studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before age 26 were 99 out of 100 never becoming smokers.
“It is obvious that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning of trying to deliver tobacco companies through packaging”, explains Health Minister Tanya Plybersek, referring to studies that show that, for example, the logo crown is associated with children with the Princess's idea.
Australia is one of the countries with the world ' s lowest percentage of smokers, so that these changes will not have a significant impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the enactment of the law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market, where low-cost and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will have serious consequences other than those intended by its proponents”, said Scott McIntyre, representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
For counterfeit producers from China and Indonesia, there will be much more for sale on Australian streets.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, claims that the demand for the ports and silica case which conceals unpleasant images on the package has increased rapidly (practically from zero) since two months ago such companies as British American Tobacque, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their case in the High Court of Australia, where they tried to appeal against the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold some 6,000 products to wholesale businesses and is awaiting a new shipment.
It's good business for us.
The potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures was, in the opinion of experts, the popularity of social networks among the very part of the population targeted by such measures.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that made illicit television advertising and support for cigarettes, as well as bans on selling cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved on the Internet.
The Australian Government had banned local companies and websites from posting ads on the Internet, but it could not restrict them on foreign websites.
"If you're a tobacco dealer and you only have this little loophole left, the idea of moving your product on the Internet will seem very appealing," explains Becky Freeman, who's studying public health at Sydney University.
Freeman notes that there is an increase in the number of brand reviews written by alleged ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the case of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro's cigarettes so much that he doesn't spare his strength and time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that industry is more involved in adapting to new regulations than in advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as the financing of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: these States have brought claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, stating that trade has been subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plybersek, the Government has discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of smoking-prevention photographs.
This rule is now accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are not on display.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"You just grab a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Heyg, who buys cigarettes with a picture of the mouth tumor on the pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yo, manager of the tobacco store King of the package in central Sydney, claims that the same packaging made it difficult to place the products on shelves.
"It took me an hour to unload a new lot, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and ban cigarettes completely, then we'd say, "What do you do, okay, it's over, closing the store," he says, throwing his hands up.
It's not so bad to miss electronic networks and permanent connections in the world.
On this day of thanks, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to reflect on the nature of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and neither books, magazines, iPhones, even duty-free shops will help much.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and professionals in child development have spoken out in favour of boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not too bad for us and our children to miss.
This causes the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we are all constantly in front of a screen, the benefits of boredom pass past us.
Maybe we should try to be bored.
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll get back to that.
In the past, like many, I thought that the invention was boring, relatively recent, when people had more free time.
This is not the case, claims Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, by Boredom: A Live History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"It's really boring to have a very ancient story," he says.
The walls in Pompeii contain Latin signs of boredom dating from the first century.
The question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Istud, associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom have often changed.
After studying the studies on this topic and asking a target group of 100 people, Professor Idwood and his colleagues came up with the following definition: Boring is when people “want but cannot do what pleases them”.
The difference between boredom and apathy, he said, was that a bored person did nothing that he wished to do.
I don't want to do anything when I'm apathetic.
The main problem, he said, was “the disruption of attention and the resulting deterioration in mood and the sense that time was running slowly”.
According to the description of boredom, it may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Istood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, people who are bored see the causes of problems in the world and the circumstances, and those who suffer from depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's just hard for us to focus on something.
In his study entitled “The Unemployed Mind: The Definition of Attention Boring”, published in the September issue of the magazine Persons on Psychological Science, Professor Idwood and his colleagues refer to an earlier experiment, whose participants listened to the recording of the magazine’s voice.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of a non-telephone program included in a neighbouring room; others heard the same sounds on low volume so that they could hardly be solved, and a third group listened only to the recording of the voice without an external audio track.
Those who heard a low volume TV pointed out that they were bored, more often than others -- they found it hard to concentrate, but they didn't know why and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting our attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fenzke, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Gvelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, “for example, by looking at the stream of articles on the conveyor in search of a marriage, the distraction music can help to avoid boredom”.
It seems to him that when people start to hang on a chair or draw doodling on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that it's actually just helping to stay physically.
"The study showed that children who are not prohibited from erza and return are better educated and remembered more information than children who are required to sit modestly," claims Professor Fenzke.
At some point, all of us are bored: at the delay of the journey (as in my case), by listening to a monotonous speech, by watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people show different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “skin of boredom” to measure such individualities.
Questions and allegations, such as “Mighty things I have to do, uniformly and monotonously” or “I'm too interested, so I don't have enough time”.
Using such questionnaires, researchers found that boys miss more girls than girls,” says Stephen Vodanović, professor of psychology at the University of Western Florida, particularly with a variety of external stimuli.
In general, however, adolescents often miss each other.
In 1991, Rid Larson, professor of personal and social development at Illinois University, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with the help of a pager.
The results were as follows: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside school.
Only 3 per cent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data on what he would be like today, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “youth age is characterized by a tendency to be bored”, mainly because children and adolescents are unable to determine fully what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is it worth it?
Sometimes not, for extremes show that it can lead people to absurd and dangerous physical acts, risky gambling, or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to rid themselves of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanović, who has devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; it's boring," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this very brain does not always know what to do.
If you're bored and you put that energy on a guitar game or cooking experience, you'll do better.
But if you start watching TV, you'll only get better for a while, and it'll pass soon.
So if your child misses and you give him iPad, he'll stop missing, but he won't learn to fight boredom alone or in any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenzke.
“And such self-regulation skills are used in a variety of situations”, he argues.
Your child learns not only to do something on his own, he also learns to control himself at all.
I don't think we're going to have to be boring.
But I don't think she's bad either.
Rather, we need to learn to feel comfortable even beyond a continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Istood agrees.
"We see it in such a way that we need to be more bored, and boring is a very unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he said.
In fact, people are trying to get away from constant anxiety and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to the constant excessive stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when there's silence, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
Until it is clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado will be applied
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team player and a student at a community college in south-eastern Colorado, is charged with a criminal offence that will soon be fully legal throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and a tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that he and his friends had been in Lamara once in September and had been driving a car across the Prairie near the border with Kansas when they were stopped by police officers.
After a police officer discovered marijuana in his car, Mr. Orosco came to court for possession of drugs and possession of drugs - minor offences, for which a fine of $100 was payable - and the date of the trial was set.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which had lasted several weeks after Colorado had voted in favour of legalizing the use of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, hundreds of minor cases depended not so much on the law as on the place of consideration.
The charges of minor crimes involving marijuana have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, D.C., which has taken a similar action.
Police stations had already stopped blaming people 21 years of age or older for keeping small doses, which would be considered legal as soon as the law came into force in a few weeks.
However, in more conservative regions of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to deal with the existing marijuana cases and continue to hold the drug accountable.
At the same time, in some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West, votes are taken in order to prevent new sales stores licensed by the state.
"It all develops so fast that I don't even know what to wait for," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora east of Denver.
Representatives of supervisory authorities in Washington State are also puzzled about their heads.
They will have to establish rules for the licensing of the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“In Colorado, a more structured market, so they will be a good example”, explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Alcohol Production and Marketing Board in Washington State.
But no one can do more now, recognizes Mr. Smith than to make some proposals and hope that this will work.
"We don't have a real precedent to guide us," he said.
The Washington State Bill, referred to as I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will fill the state with uncertainty for a year when State licensing systems are not yet in place and the right of possession of marijuana has already been legalized.
There are still difficult technical aspects to deal with during this period, for example, how to strike a balance between the state's “adequate access” to licensed marijuana, which is prohibited from trading 1,000 feet away from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana trading enterprises in the urban profile, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs”, explains Ben Livingstone, representative of the newly established study group “Centre for the Legalization of marijuana”.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police, Outs of Aurora, sent an e-mail message to his subordinates that the City Prosecutor's Office would no longer bring to justice persons who had reached the age of 21 years for possession of a small number of marijuana and that the police would cease to call people to account for these violations “from now on”.
The Chief of Police, Oates, reported that the police would monitor compliance in the city with regulations governing the activities of medical marijuana growers and would prosecute illegal drug traffickers and distributionists.
The Uld District Prosecutor in North Colorado, Ken Buck, is a more stringent approach to this issue.
Following a vote on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to prosecute the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage users to undergo treatment.
Currently, 119 persons have been charged with two or less Marihuana burials, although many of them have been accused of other violations.
“The duty of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission”, said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was mixed even in places such as the Mesa Rural District, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the district, no longer bring adults to justice for possession of small quantities of drugs.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautsinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to clear charges of pre-eminent marijuana storage cases.
"I believe that it is our direct duty to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of those voting in Colorado supported the decision, it would not be easy to include marijuana for entertainment in the State and the legal system.
And the conflicting reaction of residents in different states has exposed the mixed attitude of local authorities in the state's marijuana experiment.
“The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this regard”, explains Sean McAlister, a Denver lawyer representing convicted persons for the possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've been pursuing people for so long that they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to have a small amount of marijuana, the same as alcohol, are meant to be a pilot field throughout the country to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Legalization advocates and state officials plan to expand the area of legalized trade, but they also look forward with Opapa instructions from the federal authorities, who continue to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
It was hoped that the Office of Justice would give priority to the legalization of marijuana.
Despite several widespread arrests of medical marijuana traffickers and patients, the Federal Government has in most cases been good at the medical trade of marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The agents of the Anti-Narcotics Bureau are unlikely to break into their homes to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to the state-controlled recreational marijuana shops authorized under the new law, and believe Kevin A. Sabeth, a former drug control adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado have not waited for the actions of the federal authorities.
Prior to the presidential elections, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on opening new marijuana stores, which could not be opened earlier than a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the sale of marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a position that we grant someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a council member.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petrnella Whitet, I was rescued from Oxford for being a conservatory.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As long as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, the modern equivalent of an ancient symposium that laid the two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the history school of Wooster College at Oxford University at the end of the '80s, I collected suitcases and left, which turned out to be the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed I quit college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in a neighbor's room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson was joking that I had left because I had to drink from the hot cups.
In fact, it wasn't that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was systematically reviled and intimidated.
It's not because of my rather unusual name or what I went to private school.
I was pollinated for one reason only, and in this famous wheel of enlightenment, it looked like a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, who is now Woodrow Whitet, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Tatcher, and I was myself a supporter of conservatives.
You're asking, why remember that now?
According to recent data, a new generation of law - centered students are subject to the same kind of grass.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of Conservative Students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that granted to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at the College College College of Cristy College in Cambridge state that they are “often isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made themselves feel unwelcome” because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the College ' s equal rights committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation only exacerbated the recent BBC 2 documentary on student policy, "Stranges: Young, Smart and Right", in which conservatives were represented by extremists and neo-Nazis.
The film showed Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who rides the Rolls Road, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver picket.
At other universities, conservative students complain that they are making “goats of release due to higher fees for study”.
Luke Black, 20, Vice-President of the Association of Conservatives of Nottingham University, in an interview by a Sunday newspaper, said that “in a university environment there is a growing distortion of views on the left.
People who don't even know us think we're naked and helpless children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the History School of the College of Corpus Christi, in which an application for enhanced protection was filed, referred to such an atmosphere as “inhospitable”, and Stephanie Cheryll, 19 years old, the new president of the Association of Conservatives of Oxford University, said that the attitude of members of the student club towards law - centereders had deteriorated considerably.
"It is a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual debate and to the normal life of members of the club," she said.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just in a minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a little girl who was 18 years old and shy.
Oxford suffered from hatred for a conservative party.
One year earlier, Margaret Tatcher had been deprived of her former student by a vote due to a reduction in the budget allocation for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, it would be uncomfortable even for the parliamentarians.
During the first days of the class week, when the students met each other and the teachers, I felt what was ahead of me for the first time.
I had not yet known that teachers were not only looking through their fingers at the grasses of conservative students, but were also pleased to be part of it.
The political issues — the strike of miners, the privatization and the Government ' s opposition to sanctions against the Government of apartheid in South Africa — have crept through the wooden panels of the wall of audiences.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Mrs. Whitet," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, please translate the first paragraph."
The text gave me a hard time, and I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very kind person with a cake-like face.
"The Tetchrists don't really learn French or they just don't have enough brains?" he asked.
Other students snuck up.
My eyes were filled with tears.
"I'm telling you to take some initial French lessons at leisure if you're certainly not very busy turning around in society," Pitt said.
I'm back in my room completely unhappy.
I was at college that night alone; then someone shook my shoulder.
He was James, a second-year student from the Department of English, who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservatives Association.
'I know who you are,' he said friendlyly.
Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Every person suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives will be ridiculed.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Tatcher, so you're going to be more complicated.
Most first-year conservatives pretend to be liberal."
Later, in the local pub, I was cowardly trying to make fun of myself.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thecher says.
I couldn't make it.
The primary professor of philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied in Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How are conservatives involved in sex?" asked one of them.
- They're freaking each other, aren't they?"
I felt like I must have felt like homosexuals before the criminal prosecution was abolished in the sixtieth years.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with the same-minded only under the cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a liberal and hide my true beliefs?
For the next three years, I began to feel like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only because he belonged to Conservatives but also because he was a foreign policy adviser and one of her speakers.
He didn't show up at college.
He despised him for his Provinciality, melodiousness and commitment to Marxist-determinist views of history.
In 1997, he assumed a professorate post at the University of Bilkint in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said to me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents' home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and open - minded capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies during his fortieth years, any political views were adopted.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said sadly.
- There's no power to do that, but it's not in the city of slumbering pins...
Even my Communist friends have always acted impeccably."
His wet eyes were dimmed.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you leave university."
I was exhausted by my regular visits to London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a conservatory, did not resist the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
Next week, during a seminar when another history teacher gave me a very serious name, "the people's enemy," I decided to do the same.
In the shower of shame, I confessed that I had been brainwashed by my parents and called them "old fools."
It wasn't a long break.
The last nail in the roof of my career at Oxford was to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I did not leave, and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed the suitcase and sat down on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a blouse and a snitch.
But at the age of 18, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation at the school.
It is sadr than ever that it was Oxford who not only released fourteen Prime Ministers of the Tori, but it is still hiding behind the undeserved reputation of a university in which equality and freedom are valued.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory."
The exhibition "Valentino: Master of Shire", which was opened this week in London, ABC is talking to Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen Bornemica and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Merset House, former English Queen Elizabeth I's residence, the only place in the British capital worthy of the Valentino Garwani exhibition.
The designer admitted this at the opening of "Valentino: Master of Ciphers", a three-dimensional retrospective exhibition that integrates over 130 high fashion dresses created by his home over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is the “il Signor” Garvani, but it could not have been written without his named clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of knowledge.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened before 3 March, personal letters and photographs signed by the most prominent aristocrats, from Princess Salim Aha-Han to Lord Snoudon, including Marie-Shantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentineo shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise, from a modest portal from Voger city in northern Italy to an international “elita”.
Being in love with the royal court is not wrong.
"They don't at least put out their cigarettes about your beautiful carpet, like some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentineo is an improbable host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all enjoyed coming to his challel in Gstaade," explains the former wife of Heini Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Anielly or Eignia Niarhos.
Valentineo always preferred elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valery Macha, representing Valentine
The Argentine model of Valery Matsu recalls a charismatic modeler.
One day we went to eat dinner at his home, which was after the fashion show in Spain's square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style was evident in everything -- every detail of his apartment, in her dress, in her food, in her music.
“Each of the guests of Valentino made himself feel important and loved”, recalls the "top model," which began with the modeler in 1995 during the Paris High Fashion Week.
"He's never out of fashion because his designs are real works of art," she ends.
Family Council
Harwani's life is not a story of obsession, it's a story of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been turned into a glamorous podium of 60 metres long, which offers a change of role: the visitor takes the model and must defil from the podium, a greasy "star" pair from the greas, which is made up of the cheves of Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onsisses, a suit that used Monica Whitty in Night, or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Empress Far Dib.
This publication includes names such as Sibila Luxembourg, Gloria von Turnund Taxis, Matte-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Gabsburg.
Nati Abascal and Modeler, 2006
Many of these customers say that Valentine's First is like the first love, "you can't forget."
I remember him well.
They were pants, shirts, vests and jackets from the autumn-zima collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he made me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I commend him for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he stresses our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they're coming up to his face.
Proportions are perfect.
The Princess and the legislator of the Patricia della Govampaola d'Arenberg, too, can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentine.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamt I'd have age and reason to wear one of his night toilets...
Finally came the time in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress to put it on at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a shirt of glasses, a box in the warehouse, and a cut without a wallet.
"It was a dream, a dream," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D. Arenberg keeps his birthday dress from a fashion modeler with "maximum caution..." because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories accompanying it.
Fashion King
The Grand Final Exhibition at Somerset House - Mari-Santal Miller wedding dress for her wedding with Pavels from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as a modeler of her sewing) to make this fabric out of a silky ivory with an incendiary of pearls, twelve different circuits and a four-and-a-half-metre plume.
According to journalist Suzi Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a milestone in the fashion of the end of the twentieth century, “restitution of clients from the highest world”.
For many years, the elite's "life's way of life" is her best representative.
The Cavaler of the Great Cross (the symbol of the highest rank in Italy), the Cavaler of Labour, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Verbality, awarded by the Order of Honorary Legion, Garwani has received as much honor as any of his clients' spouses.
"I've always drawn his attention to the subtlety, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance," recalls Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a solemn dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was unpretentious, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The world's worst occupation: miners from Kawah Idena
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health by carrying 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano on a steep stone wire
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among them are Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living sulphur from Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Each day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas rising from the depth of the Earth freezes in contact with the air.
He puts them in two bamboo baskets, pulls them on his shoulders, and carries them upstairs on a rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 feet [2.386 m] high, it is only 250 metres, but wet cargoers need more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle’s step, with difficulty holding the balance, and with care in locating the road so as not to fall and fall off the cliff.
They know that one false step can cost them their lives, as it did a French tourist who broke off the cliff of Kawah Idhen a few years ago.
Cavah-Jen chess earn 5 Euro cents per kilogram of sulphur produced
Upon arriving, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them, as if they were apes from the circus and were tired of heavy baskets, walking three kilometres to the weights laid by the mining company slightly higher, at an altitude of 1,850 metres.
This is the PT Kandi Ngrambi, an enterprise that has operated this volcano since 1960 and, better not to say, its employees, who pay Rs. 662 (Euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 Euro cents) of petrochemical production, since this mineral is common in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar.
"Because the norm is to transfer 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (Euro3.8) per speed," explains Anto, who usually carries three daily transfers.
He spends three hours each and feels broken at the end, but they allow him to store Rs. 138,000 (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a myth for such a non-human effort, it is three times what he would have earned in the field.
“The daily wages for miners are very high in local measures, where Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2) per day and the average monthly earnings are two million rupees (Euro167)”, explains the loader who used to work as a stoner on Bali’s tourist island.
There, his salary was Rs. 75,000 (6.2 euros) per day and the station was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banuwanga, a town not far from the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as destructive as Sera: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus have taken her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto's astma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are going to cry because of toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, Anto had spent three years risking his life in Kawah Idhen, whose sulphur had already begun to affect him despite the existence of masks and special points.
He has asthma, he breathes hard, he coughs all the time, and his eyes cry because of the toxic gases that release the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
In his life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or hotel port, but instead he works as a mule.
For a dirty wooden cabin with other porters, it stands every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulphur keeps running at night, when its distinctive yellow color turns blue and sparkles in the darkness.
In the face of shadows, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small lamp connected to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite high profits, the mining company did not mechanize sulphur production to save costs or provide equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not receive even parts of Rs. 30,000 (Euro2.5) of the photo collection, which, together with the entrance ticket for Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2), is being taken from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people.
“This job is for livestock, not for humans”, says Badrosin, a native carrier of 42 years, who has spent three decades in Cavah-Yehhen since he left college.
He's able to raise up to 110 kilograms, and he's sure he's going to endure jobs as much as he can, because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur burns the throat and burns its eyes when the wind suddenly changes and captures miners in the dense pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so obsessive that no one complains of his severe diseases... more serious than their usual respiratory problems, arteries, knee pains and ulcers on the shoulders, which have been deformed under the weight of the basket.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unikanik can now only lift up to 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions remove 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to a warehouse in Tamansari, crossing a narrow path of 18 kilometres among the plants.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unikanik, wide opens his mouth, which lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what humans do from Cavah-Yigen.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and housing and education in the absence of children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I'm the patriarch's husband, you're my wife-in-law, we're gonna pay our civic duty and make life!
It may seem unbelievable that these lines are part of the commercialization of mint blades, but despite this — or perhaps because of this — this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put the bao into the oven" to make fun of Singapore's fertility rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that through advertising they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a entertaining way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their own national duty.
It's only for the Internet, so we needed to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the world's worst replicating of ourselves, so we felt that this was the subject that we should be addressing.
We knew that the Government had been trying to do a lot of things, such as launching spirits with pheromones or organizing quick parties (bulbs).
Many of these ideas may have been creative but have not worked.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can do to solve this problem, which is to make a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take it so lightly are the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A State package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for the child, renews maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this is very poor.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city State in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Authority, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was less than 2 is known as the rate of substitution in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Policy Office for Spouses and Families of the National People's Office, says that the reason for “improvement education” and “the broader gamma of career opportunities”.
“This has enabled people to have broader options for life's goals and priorities than for marriage and family creation”, she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of bachelors and the delayed marriage and childbirth of children, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
However, immigration policies, which aim to increase immigration dramatically in order to counter population declines, are a source of resentment among the local population.
Singapore has websites with few hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping their wages low and for not being able to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that last year Singapore's ruling party obtained the worst result in elections since independence.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in fertility has a famous impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenditures and immigration policies, Singapore ' s example also begins to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government was working to ensure that no such small housing was built.
For example, this has begun to influence the real estate sector.
The City Development Manual has moved to control the number of small apartments known as a “execution box” that can be built in certain parts of the city.
These apartments, which are 46 square metres in size, are very well sold.
However, there is the view that they can contribute to the single life style and deprive developers of incentives to build large family housing.
But Lim U-Sung, director general of the EL Developers house building firm, says that their “exchange boxes” are sold much faster than their more extensive copies.
They are more popular in that they are purchased for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger ones.
As a result, our cash revenues are increasing.
Nevertheless, he recognized that the new rules provided clearer guidance for developers who had previously been challenged if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too tense
Singapore is a city state.
While these new regulations may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have a special effect.
"People are very tense, housing is expensive, as is education, and that's why many people put it off," says a young manager.
Others may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the Government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, as far as childbirth is concerned, the last word remains for Singaporeans.
Personal on-line - Personal on-line
Confidentiality.
According to the King's Academy of Spanish, it is a private or “private sphere which is entitled to be protected from any interference”.
What is personal to a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when discussing situations on the Internet that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriodico interviewed five kids between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine" on a personal level, and "parallel and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"My greatest secrets would not have been downloaded in the post," says ten-year-old Jorge, when he was trying to explain the importance of personal information on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's got records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
On FB I download beautiful pictures or games pictures.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that isn't mine, or someone who's acting stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to publish indecent photographs of naked people, crimes, or abusive or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he's got on his FB, and he's got nine of his Follovers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows she has a password for one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just load them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't think of anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
José, aged 14, is different.
This teenager has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I get pressured or demanded, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy's no stranger to what's known today as cyberbing.
A friend I knew was blackmailing on a social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
According to José, the victim did not delete the record.
“Only included confidentiality.”
He then explains the sequence of steps to set up the record in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would download photographs of acquaintances in uncomfortable or Confuse situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like the person or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cyberbabing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marjolos Porras, an English teacher and an expert in education and education, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networking is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of finding information, but these sites have changed the rules of the game," she points out.
Parras states that the academy Mark Prenski, a teacher at Yale University, and the author of work, Digital Aborigines and immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
The digital Aborigines are they, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still studying ourselves," she says.
It explains that the topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or said, at a time when maturity is not sufficient to do so”.
"So that they will be elected, while it is most important for them to be popular, having thousands of friends without considering the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what confidentiality is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do so is useless," she adds.
Then Parras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you enjoy publishing a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know others publish about you?
When you sign pictures from a party, do you ask other people for permission to mark them?
And yet, do all of you need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them realize that they should behave online just like they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“Inside the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as he should be on social networks”, she claims.
Watchfulness
Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read in good faith social networking policies.
Knowing each point, they have good reason to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening a record online.
"For example, age and what is permitted to distribute or publish," he says.
According to Gaurdiya, the key question is to remind children of the lesson, "Don't talk to strangers."
The UNASUR summit ends without the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, proclaimed earlier and theoretically signed by the mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the VI ordinary meeting of heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Office of the President indicated on the main page that it would be transmitted after closure, but then confirmed that it would be published at some point on the Peruvian Government's website.
Asked questions about the text, they indicated that the contents were presented by the President of Peru, Oljanta Umala, during brief press statements.
The access of journalists to information about the Summit has been limited all the time.
During the day, it was only broadcast, in the press room, a video of the presidential assembly without sound, saying “closed meeting, no sound”.
A few of the information circulated among the reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some Governments of UNASUR present at the meeting, but not by Peruvian.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating Presidents, which has caused resentment to hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who have requested more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an electronic message to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but this was the Umala statement, not the official document that concluded the summit.
In the past October, Peru had hosted the Third South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and that time, despite the persistent demands of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been proclaimed, had not been circulated.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had made sure that all journalists were provided with transmission systems, but to the best of their ability to obtain information.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which settles the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Oljanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinier, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins on Monday, in The Hague, to hear the statements of both parties, as part of the charges Lima made against Santiago.
“We will observe and implement a decision that will explain the differences we are currently present before this international court”, said Umala, next to her Chilean colleague.
“It has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals”, added Pinier, and welcomed Umala’s hands against the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by the two Presidents that they were subject to the International Court of Justice was immediately following Colombia ' s opposition to the Bogota Pact this week, under which it recognized that the verdicts of that international court were subject to the decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which it considered to be erroneous.
The summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christine Kirschner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UnASUR has been suspended since 2011, following the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The incoming President, Oljanta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions this morning and closing the summit just after noon, at the time of Lima.
The Head of State read an outcome document stating that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects approved for the South American countries, with an investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR would “take important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which we are expanding the residence agreements”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “cooperation against civil uncertainty and organized transnational crime, to increase access to medicines, to affordable Internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the combined and effective risks of natural disasters”.
Since Europe is in crisis, “the economic association (Latin America) should not have a triumphal basis but should serve to expand our production base and anticipate a better future for our cities”, Umala added.
“We have decided to grant privileges to a group of 31 sign projects that will improve the communication of South America’s spaces, particularly in the village and border zones... bringing our countries together and creating new economic schemes”, said the Peruvian President in a message he had read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five belonged to Peru and were limited to cross-border axles in his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two focused on a greater link with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The outcome document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve as its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations”, from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace would be united and have good relations among its neighbours was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court contested by Bogotá.
"The day after Saturday, perhaps to meet President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
“We shall review all these paths, which are not mutually exclusive, including the Pact with Nicaragua, for discussion with Nicaragua”, he stressed.
"To President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico City on Saturday, where they will be present for the new President of that country, Enrique Penya Nieto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the ministers of defence met provisionally to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Guyana, Suriname, Uruguay and Paraguay formed UNASUR, although the latter had been suspended.
Peru has a provisional presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America should learn from Europe on the question of integration of citizenship”: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Raphael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common nationality is an objective in which “South America, in this case, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, stated to the Peruvian State television that Europeans had “killed one another during World War II” and other clashes,“but they are now almost one story”.
He had defended, in this context, the South American citizenship project, which endorsed the UNASUR member countries.
“There must be free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as has already been the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reaction sectors that want us back”, he warned.
In addition, the Ecuador President has shown himself to be a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the assumption that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States will be reduced and that those who have signed the San José Pact on Human Rights will be taken into account.
Those who give lectures never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is not clear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington, D.C., financed by the United States”, he stated, with a view to the political asylum offered by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanjo.
Correa assured him that he did not regret his decision because he did not betray his principles but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that at the time “there were certain suspicions that Assangj would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring him to come into his territory to question the alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law considers it possible to implement it through videoconference which could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of deterioration in Assang ' s physical and mental health.
"I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the Ambassador has informed me that he has had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
What is really true is the risk of his physical and mental health deteriorating due to the fact that he is in a small space without being able to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any human," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution to the asylum problem provided by Assangio to the Ecuador Embassy in London since June by providing security that would enable him to travel to Ecuador was in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the sealing of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights; we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European judiciary, because counsel for Assang, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European jurisdictions”, he mentioned.
And he thought, "If Britain gives the guarantee of integrity tomorrow, it will end."
If Sweden, as well as its legislation allows it and as it has done in other cases, questions Mr. Assang at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or questions him on Skype, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took this opportunity to show himself to be a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate “directity, integrity and lies which distort freedom of expression”.
"The chief enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt political villains, but bad journalists who support wealth, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he remained pleased that neither these journalists nor bankers nor burguase hegemons dominated Ecuador, and added that, being re-elected, he would “sharp the revolution to continue development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in UNASUR until at least the next elections, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for the coups under the rule of law” because in fact,“this destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy”.
The Ecuadorian President also considered that his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos was now in a position to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime boundaries between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which had proved to be in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At present, this decision is not respected.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by a desire to go together.
They must be processed together to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed the hope of a good conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute in the same Court of Peru and Chile and stated that “it is appropriate for Latin America to apply to international bodies if two countries commit themselves to making a decision, however serious it may be”.
Referring to the opportunity to stand as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he said that he was considering this opportunity “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes difficult”.
Correa assured me that if she lost the election in February 2013, she would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations such as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be redressed only by political power.
"My political movement believed that I had guaranteed this likely victory, so I had to recognize this responsibility," he said.
If won, it would be my last term as president and then we will leave public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"It's a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new treatment course for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez of Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice-President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to a treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss out on a campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean an increase in the state of health of President Chávez," he explained.
The Head of the State of Ecuador participated in Lima today at the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
The factory was 21 years old when it was announced that his AIDS tests had yielded positive results.
"I feel as if I've been deaf," he recalls as hard as a doctor, despite all the stroke, a moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified -- he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
The factory is one of the "old" patients of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), where it was found in 1994 to overcome a number of obstacles.
He's been living with a diagnosis of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years now, and it would be hard to believe in the early 1990s -- too few treatments were available at that time, too little was known about the disease, too much prejudiced about the sick.
So even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection didn't want to say good-bye to him "because he had a cut."
In other words, it was a sentence to have AIDS back then.
It is now possible to survive and do so without deteriorating the quality of life.
However, without knowing it, many people still come when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greatest achievement at this time is that the survival of the patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, stated the head of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, pointing out that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
An infectious and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva, explained that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a sentence, but that the length and quality of life depended on the extent of the immune system available to patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with the best life expectancy for non-drug users, up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 were reported.
Simply put, the above means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25, according to these terms, “by maintaining control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age”, he explained.
In order to assess this progress, it should be recalled that Mexicans are now on average 76 years old.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS has declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the emergence of AIDS.
In Khalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths had already been recorded by May of this year; nevertheless, there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it, it's in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we haven't had a health problem, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He cited the devastating data: “Twenty out of ten patients come when they already have any opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on total mortality is to conduct diagnostic tests at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a mass scale, for all people who ask for it.”
The proposal brings together specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Khalisco (COESIDA), as well as patients, such as Fabricio, who went to a private laboratory for testing, motivated only by his friend and, despite his youth, he was already in the AIDS phase and even suffered from sarcom Kaposhi, cancer tumor, which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I die anyway, I'd better kick three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There's a positive change, I'm eating well, I'm practicing, I'm taking drugs.
To date, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live normal lives like any other.
"I'm working, I'm doing a lot of work, I'm traveling, I'm engaged in sexual activity, but I'm both responsible, I care about myself and the other person," she listed Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to speed up his statement to those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, in fear.
Let it be checked if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV positive or better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person who is responsible.
This message summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year in 2012.
Conveniences behind the counter
Richard Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has dealt with HIV-related issues, believes that there is a wide gap between health programmes and ordinary citizens.
And the biggest prevention is that.
In the sites dedicated to this task, "the condom distribution has actually increased, we've been given one or two before, now we're given hundreds of packages, and that's very good, but it turns out there are some who still don't have access to condoms," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why don't you?" This popular question, with the cunning and condemnation of social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health workers who don't want to hear adolescents, assured the propagandist.
I suggest that this inefficient distribution be changed; that condoms not only be behind the counters and that hundreds of them be placed in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.
It is not the encouragement of debauchery.
It was not about the payment of beer and motels, and the Governor, Emilio González, replied when he was asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality; it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Khalisco
13.435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV) registered.
The state ranked 4th in the national rating for new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92 per cent of the infections are sexually transmitted, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent through the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are between 4 and 5 registered people who do not know.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that cancels the restructuring of the Vitro Panel's debt through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a good precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country with a capacity to pay problem.
It seems that procedures in support of the survival of firms authorized by Mexican law are not valid in the country of lanes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the approval of the decision rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale before the bankruptcy court of the northern district of Texas leaves Mexican firms vulnerable to the possibility of arresting their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the order opens doors to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an entry, while the judge of the case notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings related to the competitive proceedings under consideration in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law had been established, defining the American Institute of Law as arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that without the inter-firm vote recognized in the critical mass of the debt-producing process that the branches of Vitro had before the parent company, there would be no majority required to approve the restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time that the scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agromex and the Central Mexicana, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that by subtracting the votes of the affiliates, in one way or another, the creditors of Vitro, who fought against him in United States courts, namely the “suners” funds, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The voting would be 45 per cent against 37.
These figures are omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation he has faced since 2008, which has been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has faced when it strikes the country.
So far, the Gonzalez Sada family firm will appeal to the Court of Appeal itself for a vote to reach its plenary, that is, five judges, given that only three voted.
In the event of a failure, an application for a certificate would be made, which would require a review of the proceedings by the highest court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
The Court has rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico as amicus curiae (“the court's friend”), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Procedure Act, indicating that it exempts itself from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries in order to link it to article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Two-board Karambol, they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General balance
In view of the several months-long complaints lodged on the table by the Mexicana de Aviacion trade unions against the company ' s former owner, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud by the Office, the Association of Air pilots has already found a bottled throat.
The agency, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Moreno, has just submitted a criminal case against the National Banks and Security Commission, which is charged with obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory body has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic concerning the operation performed by the businessman to recover from the trust fund of the IXE Bank, 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexican Airlines.
Resources would be devoted to the purchase of shares of the hotel ' s professional management company.
As you know, Ascarrog Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Circumcision Dragon Mart
Meeting at the Caribbean University weekend, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of general civil society endorsed the establishment of a broad front to counter the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, with a residential area close to 150 companies.
Canacintra had previously been able to bring together the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the Montreal forces, who had aligned part of the protected territories with the land and had raised serious threats against the industry.
ACCTA Death
With regard to the Government ' s rejection of the Senate ' s requirement to explain under what circumstances and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Counter-Factation, known as the acronym for the English ACCTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case had already become an archive.
As you know, the action has been carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself has disqualified the opportunity to view it as a violation of freedom of expression in social media.

Hector Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Hector's hearty basketball traveler, Hector Reyes, has been associated with this sport for over 60 years and has led the world around.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector Hetin Reyes.
And before he was crammed into the brain by a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was loaded into sports for more than 60 years, as a small player, a high basketball league player, a commissioner and head of BSN with Baemon Cowboys and a president of the Federation of Basketball.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several times as I was President BSN, Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalls during his visit to his home in Baaimon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball Was My Life."
Reyes is not exaggerating by making this claim.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things collected for his long journey, testify to this.
Bajamon Into the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he retains those who remember his path through the Cowboys, from the mid-1950s, as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old as a co-agent or agent of the contract.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had been able to be part of eight cowboy championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year that Jerome Minsie debuted in BSN.
Since then, Kuko Ortiz, who was a great administrator, has continued to lead,” said Reyes.
I remember that Jean Bartov, who went here and was at Alabama University, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, six'7."
"Do you want?"
And that was the beginning of Minsk, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bart then recommended Sniper Raymond Gauss, who was granted citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsk had brought the Baemon championship, Gauss would have helped to win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy championship with Houses, but I was already away because by 1988 I was the chief of the Federation.
By that time, I had preferred to enjoy his achievements and those of the Minsk National Assembly.
I remember winning for the first time in the United States during an Olympic qualification tour in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we got fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian judge who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
The 1990 World Championship team is the best team you've ever seen?
She's among the best, just as she won Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and destroyed the United States, which was pretty much like the one that won our bronze in the championship of the world.
Not only were Minsk, Gaussa, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and Piculina (ortisa), but also the young (Havier) “Tonito” Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (France and Edgar) and Mario “Kichote” Morales, who were unable to participate in 1990 because of knee injuries.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but which brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic qualification tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alice, and young Rolando Hurruitner, in exchange for those who were suspended for disorder at the Mar del Plata Pan American Championship, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't count on his career in the various leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Young people, I love Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most famous era of national assembly between 1988 and 1995 and up to 17 crews in the BSN in the early 1990s.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to do, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, only boys from Ponce play in their own field and against teams from other parts of the island in national plei-off.
The boys are traveling and playing too much now, and that's too much.
At least I see the results of mandatory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
It makes me feel good.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, I watch music videos of my age on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren, and I often go to basketball games.
And of course, I'm enjoying my wife's society, Isabel, who's always been with me.
Dead actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Fort Wehrth, Texas, became world famous for his role as John Ross Yuing, better known as J.R., in the television series “Dallas”, where he introduced a businessman without principles, evil and manipulation.
Larry Hagman, whose role as an oil predator, Jay Ar Yuing, in the “Dallas” series, became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new “Dallas” season, died on Friday night because of the complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement given to The Associated Press by Warner Bros, a “Dallas” company.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing a symbol role that he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at a fair for Thanks Day.
Linda Grey, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the Sicvele, was next to Hagman when he died at the Dallas Hospital, told her by Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind, and talented, and I'll miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," said Grey in a statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and was given a transplant.
Long before “Dallas”, Hagman became famous on television because of the role of a decent type in the light comedy “I Dream of Jeannie”, broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changing when he meets an attractive girl, a girl named Barbara Eden, and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedys who rarely appeared on the air, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His work in the movie included roles well accepted by critics in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his master's interpretation of the marvelously repugnant J.R. that brought Hagmen to the top of glory.
The CBS drama series on the Jung clan and other figures in its environment was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
"Who shot J.R.?", designed to create a noise around the episode, full of emotion, in which the character Hagman almost killed, generated international discussions and millions of dollars that he risked at bookkeeping offices.
It also helped attract a record audience to the show at that time.
When the November 1980 episode was answered, an average of 41 million television viewers watched it and turned Dallas into a second entertainment program in history, after the final "MASH" in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was a brother-in-law named J.R., Christine (in execution of Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R., she was interrupted and then threatened to blame her for prostitution if she didn't get out of town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hegman played Yuing as an insatiable corruption player with a charismatic smile: an dishonest businessman and an adulterous husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Grey), to be placed for treatment.
"I know what should be on J.R." said Hagman in 1988.
It must be said, "There will be an honest citizen of J.R. Juing."
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Príncipal, also a heroine of the original show, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "a bit violent, both on and off screen."
It is memorable and indispensable for millions of readers around the world, and it is within the hearts of each of us who have had the privilege of knowing and loving it.
Ten episodes of a new release of “Dallas” were shown several months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Five episodes of the second season were already completed, and the sixth was in production, reporting the canal.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what would happen to the show after Hagman's departure.
Fort Wehrt, Texas, was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who glistened in classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when he was born in 1931 when he married Ben Hagman.
He sought happiness in the theater scenes of New York in the early 1950s and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist named May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California town of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tal (and Absolutity True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't include anything that I thought could hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he said to Prince Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a hospital volunteer to help fearful patients.
“I give them advice, offer them courage, meet them when they go to operations, and after”, he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little awkward for a short time, but you'll be okay."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course is under way to explore the “End of Light”
Every week, students are studying apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this sester, when Professor of Religion Stuart Sharme decided to read the course on the end of the world, he knew he had an inexorable bait: the end of the Maya calendar's "long-range countdown", 21 December, which many people took for as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was expected in the next couple of months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call the “long-Armageddon”, and the growing conflict that would involve Israel, a place where Christian theories of the end believe that the Apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharme this week at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
Looking at what is happening in the world at present, as if we had only 30 days left, it was indeed a good period.
And remember, bad things are good for those who have an apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" in this sester, theoretically the last in history.
At Templ University, associate professor Barry Walker teaches a course entitled “The Media, Culture and End of the World”.
Every week, students study the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas are spread over time,” he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios are suggested that lead to certain actions by a person.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war may break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic subjects and studied how they relate to real - life examples.
"I've tried to tell the students what's probably unlikely and impossible," said Walker.
At the University of Pennsylvania's main campaign, Professor Matthew Restaul of Latin America and his colleague Amar Solari, associate professor of history of art and anthropology, came together to read a course called "The End of the World."
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the world doesn't come," said Restal.
Despite the “immediate destruction”, students must learn, prepare projects and pass final examinations.
In Penn State, the final examination will be taken into the Canon of the Apocalypse, which leaves no choice but to work "until the night at which the end of the world is expected to come," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"The town ended in two hours," said Restaurant about his high-level student course, for which 35 students were enrolled.
We received e-mail messages within weeks of the beginning of the semester from people who asked if there were any other places.
The students, in turn, assure themselves that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology at Huddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he was watching all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course to teach it," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed -- let alone the professor -- said that he believed on the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Maya prophecy, and in some way we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last course at Temples University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said Restal.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which includes several centuries in which people react to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Most of all in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question as to whether he knew any course on the “end of the world” there.
“Philippines does not participate at the end of the world”, he wrote, presuming a higher order.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
He drew attention to the fact that many days of the last trial had been mentioned for a long time and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people would immediately start thinking about the next date” or philosophy, that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period in which the world would end.
Students and teachers take care of this date.
Some said they were going to go to the end of the world party.
"Maybe I'll call one of my friends to laugh together," commented Samir Ford, a 20-year-old student in the Department of Communications.
