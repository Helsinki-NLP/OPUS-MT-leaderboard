Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that they will “associate with cartpets”
The recommendation to change the title of their office to “member of Parliament of Wales” (MWP) is frightening.
This recommendation came through plans to change the name of the assembly to "Parliament Wales".
TIMES of the entire political spectrum are concerned that it can provoke ridicule.
One present from the Labourists claimed that his group was troubled by the rum of Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, “twp” means “unthinkable”, and “pwp” means defecation.
The present from the Wales Party stated that its group as a whole was “unsatisfied” and offered alternatives.
One of the Wales Conservators said that his group was "unprecedented" to change its name, but noted that MWP could quickly become a "mippet."
In this context, the pronunciation “w” is similar to that of the Yorkshire English pronunciation for `u'.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing legislation to change names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be made by the members themselves”.
The Wales Self - Control Act of 2017 gives the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public discussion of proposals, and the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales received wide support.
In terms of what we call the time, the commission suggests that they be called “members of the Wales Parliament,” or WMP, but MWP has received the greatest support from the public.
Of course, this time offers alternatives, but an effort to reach an agreement may cause problems for the chairman, Ellen Jones, who should submit a draft amendment bill for a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the work of the assembly, including rules for the removal of the clock and the structure of the committee system.
TIME will hold a final vote regarding its new name when legislation is discussed.
The Macedonians go to vote for a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to “North Macedonia Republic”.
The vote was organized to resolve a long - term dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that their northern neighbor’s name is a claim to Greece and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposes the holding of a referendum on the change of name, stated that he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaire, claim that a change of name is simply a price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's call is silent, because Harlem's churches are going through difficult times.
“The elderly people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church here earlier,” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither one nor the other.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
"People today are socializing differently.
The bars are no longer like a local living room where they come in regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and “might sooner or later they will end up where they started”.
The churches, he added, could replace houses with condominiums, and there would be people who would not help the nearby shrines.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” Adams explained, “so it will accelerate the day when all these churches close, for it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their members.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolis Community Church was built in 1870 and St. Martin was built ten years after it.
The native white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The Black Community, which held rituals nearby, was granted ownership of the building.
St. Martin went to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on the 125th street, the main commercial street of Harlem, who refused to hire blacks and raise them in the service.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by the fire, but Johnson’s father’s parishioners wanted it restored and installed a carillion.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Johnson's father in St. Martin, proudly called the carillion "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillion in July called it another way: “cultural treasure” and “exchangeable historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the world's first carillion to be played by the black musician Dionysio A. Linde, who turned to a larger carillion in Riverside 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweser, there was no substitute for him in St. Marten.
What's happening in Saint Martin over the last few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of whom were involved by church leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The Council, a parliamentary governing body made up of the laity leaders, wrote in July to the diocese concerned that the diocese “will attempt to transfer expenses” was happy that the council did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishes complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark was injured by a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California.
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, and the boy was diving for lobsters in California on the day he opened the lobster season.
The attack took place at nearly 7: 00 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy cry out for help, and together with a group of them sailed to get him out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a catch on a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was crying out, "I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his key was completely torn apart.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, "In the waters of the shark!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken to the Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
A rescue captain, Larry Giles, told the media briefing that a few weeks ago there was a shark in the area, but it was found that it did not refer to dangerous species of sharks.
Jails added that the victim had suffered trauma at the upper part of the body.
For 48 hours of investigation and security, authorities blocked access to the beach from the Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas.
Jails noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsury's planning to enter the British market for cosmetics.
Sainsburg's going to compete with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams using cosmetic islands like those in colleges.
As we enter the British market for cosmetics at a cost of £2.8 billion (and as the sales of clothing and household goods go down), the expanded cosmetic islands will be tested at 11 shops throughout the country, and next year, if the idea is successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investments in cosmetics are related to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the space previously used under television, microwave furnaces and household goods.
In Sainsbury's, they said that they would double the range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including for the first time, brands like Revlon, Essie, Twizerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space: brand zones will appear, like those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also updates the Boutique cosmetics: Now most of the products represented will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly required by young buyers.
Besides, the retailer of Fragrance Chop protests his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second tray will open in Celly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and buying small quantities of food every day in small stores makes supermarkets extra effort to attract visitors.
Mike Coop, executive director of Sainsburg's, said that their shops would become more like supermarkets because the supermarket network is trying to resist Aldi and Lidl's disciples with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's open sections of Argos in hundreds of their shops, and also open a series of Habitats.
The previous attempt at the supermarket to upgrade the space and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute about how to divide the incomes from the pharmacies at the supermarkets.
A new strategy came up after Sainsuriy's sold their Pharmaceutical business (281 pharmacies) Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Charmacy network, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
They agreed that Loyds would help by adding an extended set of Luxembourg-based skin-care brands, including La Roche-Pasay and Vicy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Sainsuri, stated: "We changed the appearance of our cosmetic islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for consumers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who could provide advice.
The brands we present are intended to meet any needs, and a pleasant environment and comfortable location mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "swaggered" because Holly Willowby came out with an agreement worth £11 million.
The Dragon Light Star, Peter Jones, is "gruntled" because TV conductor Holly Willoughoubie came out of a deal with his brand of goods for life (the value of the deal is 11 million pounds sterling) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spiersr and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for the household clothes brand and the Assemblies Truly.
The couple's business was connected to Goop Gwynette Peltrow's brand.
A 37-year-old program manager, This Morning, announced her entrance to Instagram.
Holly Willowby led Peter Jones' "The Light of the Dragon" to rabies when he came out of their profitable life goods business at the last moment to focus on new profitable contracts with Marks & Spence and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is "swallowed" when a gold girl from the TV confessed during a busy meeting on Tuesday at Jones' business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements worth £1.5 million mean she no longer has enough time to spend his shared brand of household clothes and Truly asses.
This business was related to Goop Gwynth Peltrow's brand and was supposed to double Willowby's asset, which is valued at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willowby reported to Instagram coming from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his recreational houses.
The source reported: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s top priority.
He was to become its long - term future for the next few decades.
Willoubee’s decision to quit business shocked all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost on the eve of the launch.
The headquarters in Marlow is full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the lead Heis Morning, which is one of Britain's most highly paid stars, could cost the firm millions of dollars because of the large investment in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes) and create further delays with launch.
It can also mean an end to long friendships.
The mother of the three children, Willowby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willowby and Cappa created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
The couple held festivals together, Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s television company shares.
Willowby will be the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Anthony McCarlin as leader I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
The source near Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his affairs."
A hard conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from news media for a comment someone would consider "not presidential" and for the very positive attitude he had toward North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump make such big concessions? ”
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news speaker. —
I've never done anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in his second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearization in North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have reached a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading North Korean diplomat Ri Young Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the "responsible reaction" from the United States to its first disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with pressure support sanctions.
When he gave a speech at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea, ” he declared.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had yielded positive results: the completion of missile trials, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American military personnel to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like presidents, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this piece of crowded stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there, ” said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and the Indonesia earthquake destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people
In particular, after the Lombo earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were affected, the national catastrophe was not declared — a prerequisite for international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it’s a little difficult, ” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children, it is not until it is known that foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sootopo, representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities appreciated the situation in Palau to determine whether international organizations could be allowed to provide assistance.
Given the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for nature’s anger.
In the province of Aceh, shelters are built from tsunamis, but they are not characteristic of other coasts.
The apparent absence of a siren warning of tsunamis in Palau, although the warning was valid, probably contributed to death.
Moving between a host of Indonesian islands is not easy even in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship in Lombok to treat victims of the earthquake is going to Palau, but it can reach the site of a new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure by building the basis of his electoral campaign and increasing the cost of roads and railways.
But the funding deficit created problems for Mr. Joko's administration, which plans to move in next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by prolonged interfaith enmity in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands evicted from their homes as a result of opposition to Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machete, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes a new monument that will suffer from "historic re-writing"
The removal of the statue would have been a deserved payment for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts in the Taliban style, which his fanatic followers did.
But Cromwell's community called Mr. Creek's proposal "stupidness" and "inquiry to rewrite history".
John Goldsmit, head of Cromwell's Society, said: "In view of the current debate about the filming, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell near Westminster Palace was inevitable."
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither carried out by Cromwell himself nor at his command.
Cromwell is likely to be unholyly sacrificed for his predecessor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell by William Hamo Tornecroft is a testimony to the mood of the 19th century and part of the history of the figure, which many think is still worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmit told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many are probably more likely at the end of the 19th century than they are now thinking Cromwell is a defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course monarchies.
Is such an idea entirely accurate — the subject of historical debate that endures?
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures that represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as the Protector Lord are also worth noting and honoring.”
Killer pig killed a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the name Yuang was found dead in blood with a broken artery at a pig’s market in Liupangshui, in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In California, Qinhai Province, China, May 30, 2005, the pig is going to vaccinated pigs in lead.
It is reported that on Wednesday he left his cousin from neighboring Yunnan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning the brother found him dead and found the lead door open.
The brother noted that there was a large boar with blood on its mouth.
A forensic medical expert confirmed that a 249 kilogram boar destroyed a farmer until his death.
“My cousin’s feet were bloodthirsty and distorted, ” stated the victim’s cousin with Wu’s name, quoted by Guyang Evening News.
The security record showed that Joan had entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed her pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
An animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuang or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police collected evidence on the scene, the pig was locked to prevent its attack on the people.
Seven of me are reported to be Yuanya and the market administration to discuss compensation for his death.
Rarely, there have been cases of pig attacks on people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and injured a man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg had been held tight to a tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After the Oregon farmer ate his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer stated that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a trigger.
"They're just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You should simply treat them with due respect, ” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring extensive rains to the southwest of the United States
It was predicted that Hurricane Rosa was shrinking as she moved over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
But in the next few days, Rose's going to bring rains to northern Mexico and south-west the United States.
Rose had a speed of 137 km per hour (i.e. hurricane 1) at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday and 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that on Sunday, Rosa will go north.
In the meantime, the Pacific Ocean begins to form a valley that moves east to the western coast of the United States, and as it approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, it will begin to push strong tropical humidity northward of the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will rain up to 25.4 inches [2.4 cm] in parts of Mexico.
Next, in the coming days, tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching valley, will create strong rains in the southwest.
In this area between . 254 and 10.2 cm, the rain will cause dangerous rains, garbage flows, and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will increase rainfall to between 5 and 7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain in some parts of the southwest, especially in a large area of Arizona.
Rainstorms are possible in a rapidly deteriorating environment because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We are urged not to walk to the desert, for possible tropical rains may occur.
Heavy rain can make canyons rock rivers, and storms can bring storm winds and dust storms.
The approach of the valley will cause heavy rains in parts of California’s northern coast.
The rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause massive waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first downpour in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainstorms will start approaching Arizona late on Sunday and morning on Monday, and the rain will become more extensive on Monday and Tuesday evening.
It will rain heavily over the Fore-Corners from Tuesday through Wednesday.
In October, intense temperatures can be observed throughout the United States, since the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
At times, this can lead to a sharp drop in temperature at short distances.
On Sundays you will see a fine example of sharp temperature swings in the central part of the United States.
It's almost a 7 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, summer heat will try to come back and spread.
It is expected that in a large area of central and eastern U.S.A., the temperature from the southern plains is expected to be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long - term forecast of weather, there is a high probability that the average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States will be exceeded in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched the Brett Cavanano hearing
On Thursday, over 20 million people on six television networks watched exciting testimony from a candidate for the post of judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavanano and Christine Bleisi Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, allegedly in the 1980s.
The political confrontation continued, the channels interrupted scheduled programs to announce the latest news on Friday: the agreement prepared by Senator Arisoni Jeff Flake about the FBI's one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavanano was holding her drunk and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Cavanano said in his emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this was not the case.
It's very likely that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people were watching this, as reported by Nielsen's research company.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, could not be accessed immediately.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching television in offices.
In comparison, such an audience is similar to an audience watching a play-off game or an Oscar prize.
Fox News Channel, whose thinkers strongly supported Cavanano's assignment, was the leader in all channels of the hearing, which lasted all day, with an average audience of 5.69 million, in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, CNN had 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the central figure of the Friday drama.
The official of this modest republican published a statement that he would vote for Cavanano, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS were recorded as protestors screaming at Flake when he tried to go to the committee's hearing on an elevator.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was scolded, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have authority, but many women are powerless."
Flake reported that his office had issued a statement and that before the elevator was closed, he added that he would do more at the committee’s hearing.
All cables and broad channels were broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee was to vote on the promotion of Kavano’s candidature to the Senate in full composition.
Flake said he'd only do that if he knew that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, which was a democratic minority.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations with his friend, Senator Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and then with several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had an influence because it was obvious that the Republicans would have no votes to appoint Cavanaugh without investigating.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Cavanano.
British Prime Minister Theresa May blames critics for playing politics around Brackit.
In a Sunday Times interview, Prime Minister Theresa May criticized her plans to leave the European Union in “policy games” with Britain's future and to undermine national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview near Theresa on the front page of the paper, the former Foreign Minister of her government, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Checkers Plan for Bracks, stating that it was "quite absurd" to invite Britain and the EU to draw one another.
Who fired at Wade Sims: The police arrested Dyton Simpson on suspicion of the death of a member of the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a suspect in a shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana.
Dyton Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and sent to prison on charges of murder of a second degree, reported to the police department of Baton Rouge.
The authorities published a video of the dispute between Sims and Simpson, and the police stated that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police removed the glasses from the crime scene and indicated that they had found Simpson’s DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed that he had shot Wade.
According to counsel, he was set up as a bail of $350,000.
The East Baton-Ruz coroner's office released the previous report on Friday, which states that the cause of death is the fiery wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its appreciation to the special unit for the search for fugitives in Louisiana, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, South University police, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Alleley, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “sacrificence and the pursuit of justice”.
Simsa was 20 years old.
Forvard grew to 198 cm in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the University of Louisiana.
In the past season, it had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the University of Louisiana, Will Wade, said that the team was devastated and "sucked" by Wade's death.
"It's what's bothering you all the time," said Wade.
The volcano casts ash into Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of Mexico’s capital city.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano because the crater began to operate and registered 183 gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center tracked many noises and impulses.
The picture on social networks shows thin layers of ash on the frontal glass of cars in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Hoquimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increase in the activity of a volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, following an earthquake of 7.1 points in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police faced Catalan separatists just ahead of the annual ballot for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protestors who were fighting for independence faced a special police unit, thousands of people joined protest demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catholic separation vote.
A masked proseparatist group, held by special agents, threw eggs and powdered paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
The skirmishes took place and later on that day, the police used sticks to contain aggression.
A few hours later, a group of independence supporters who were protesting, “We will not forget, we won't forgive!” faced conservationists who shouted,“ Let Spain live! ”
According to a local press report, 14 people were helped to cope with minor injuries sustained by protests.
A year after the referendum of October 1, which was declared illegal by Madrid but was marked by Catalan separatists, tensions in an area that yearned for independence remain high.
The voters generally decided to vote for independence, but the appearance was low because most of those who opposed the separation were boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police attempts to stop voting in polling stations throughout the region.
The independence teams spent the night in tents on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it had to go on a different route.
68-year-old Narcisse Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, stated that he no longer had the hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
“We went through one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry for joy in voting, but now we are at a dead end, ” he said.
Despite the vital but very complex victory in the regional elections last December, the Qatari parties that advocate independence failed to maintain this year's momentum, because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their participation in the referendum and the further proclamation of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanics who was protesting police support on the phone, said that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oril Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who've been in an insulator since the end of last year, announced that he's going to be running for the European Parliament next year.
“The status of a candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression that we observe from the Spanish government,” he said.
The men were arrested after the car drove into the house.
Three men at 33 years of age, 34 and 39 were arrested after having driven a car several times into a house in London.
The incident took place on Thursday night at 7:30 British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings noticed that the gate and the house itself had been damaged.
It is quite possible that at some point a car was shot from an arbalate.
Kick Mengi gave Livingston a victory over Rangers with a 1-0 account
Dolly Mengi's first goal in Livingston became victorious.
The Lukingston class was shocked by the Rangers and defeated Stephen Gerardo's second 18-game player as the manager of the Aybrox Club.
Dolly Mengi's hit turned out to be crucial: Gary Holt's team rose to one level in a second from the Hybernian.
Gerard's team won no victory at this season's Premierise tour, and next Sunday he's playing with the Harts leaders, from whom she's eight-pointd.
Prior to this, the Rangers will be adopted on Thursday Vienna within the framework of the League of Europe.
In the meantime, Livingston has continued its unconquerable move to six divisional games, and chief coach Holt has not yet been defeated since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston misses the chances of indecent guests.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they were killed, because their directness creates Rangers of all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but made a blow along the gate; then Alan Littlee struck past the gate after he rebelled and took the hit Craig Hallett along the gate that he had made his head.
The owners were satisfied that they allowed Rangers to play with them, and they knew that they could cause problems for visitors from standard positions.
That's how a crucial goal was killed.
The Rangers missed a free blow, and the Livingston opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson activated Mengu, who took the ball and killed it from the center of the fine.
Until this point, Rangers was dominated by the ball, but the protection of the landowners turned out to be untried, and Liam Kelly's gatekeeper was mostly unsettling.
This trend continued in a second time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike Kelly.
Scott Pittman was hit by a Hollyper Ranger's leg, Allan McGregor, and he hit the door in another standard Livingston combination.
The Nasses were constantly flying into the Livingston fine and constantly neutralized, and two applications for the bar were rejected after the Hulkett attack on Glenn Middleton, who was replaced by a game of hand.
Livingston Fan: Analysis
Alladair Lamont of "BBC Scotland" at the "Tony Macharoni Arena" Stadium
The funnel game and the result of Lingston.
Everyone was playing great, they were still above expectations on this uptrodden path.
Their style of play and composition has remained virtually unchanged after returning to the highest level, but Holt must be given credit for the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket played enormously, organized a very good defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Warral keep on the watch.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerard’s leadership, but now they don’t get much of it.
They didn't get enough of the last ball -- only once they broke up the defenses of the owners of the field -- and it was kind of like waking up for Rangers, who ended up in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was received in Cologne with mixed meanings.
On Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin, they saw smiles and blue skys.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's contradictory visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
Some of the issues raised were human rights, freedom of the press, and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Keln to open up a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 people from meeting before the mosque, but many of the president's supporters did appear nearby to see it.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan — including many Kurds — have also forced themselves to hear, condemning Erdogan’s politics and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Two - way protests reveal the ambiguity of the visitor, whom some German Turks described as a hero and others as dictator.
Depford Road Accident: A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car
A bicycle player was killed in a collision with a London car.
The accident occurred at the Beswood Street Cross and Evelyn Street on a lively road in the Deptford area of the southeastern city at about 10:15 a.m. in British Standard Time.
The driver stopped, and paramedics came to the scene, but the man was killed.
This accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after a driver escaped from an adventure on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from a Saturday accident.
The London police stated that they were working on setting up a man to inform his immediate family.
Passing is forbidden and bus routes are changed, and car users are advised to avoid this zone.
Long Lantin prison: six prisoners injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured by the assault in a male maximum security prison, reported to the prison administration.
The riot in Her Majesty Long Lantin prison in Woostershire began at about 09:30 a.m. on Sunday.
To stop the riots initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special unit called Tornado was called.
The officers were given medical care in connection with the light injuries of the faces on the scene.
The prison representative commented: “In order to resolve the incident in Her Majesty Long Laarten prison, a specially trained prison staff was involved.
Six employees received medical treatment for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and their detention may be extended.”
In Her Majesty Long Lantin prison, there are more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief had been sent to a permanent hospital after the prisoner had attacked.
In October last year, a special police unit was sent to prison to stop the serious disturbances in which prisoners were attacked with billows
Hurricane Rosa threatens Feenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood floods (arid areas can benefit)
Tropical depression rarely hit Arizona, but this can happen at the beginning of next week, since the remains of Hurricane Rose are heading through the southwest of the desert, creating a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flooding on Mondays and Tuesdays from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Fenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's expected that Rosa's going straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and then it's going to rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Fenix since 1950,
a Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to recent forecasts by the National Hurricane Center, the Mogollon Rom district in Arizona is estimated to be 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and places up to 15.24 cm of rainfall.
Other parts of the south-west desert, including the central part of the Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to get between 2,54 and 5.08 cm rainfall, possibly up to 10.16 cm.
When there is no risk of flooding, Rose’s rain may be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rains are likely to be useful, because the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Centre, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is affected by extreme drought, the second highest category of drought, reportsweather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rose leads to a shift on the Mexican peninsula in Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, is still in force at a wind speed of 137 km per hour, 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 19.3 km per hour.
The storm meets with more cool water in the Pacific Ocean and thus weakens.
Thus, a tropical storm is expected to cause a landslide in Mexico during the day or in the evening of Monday.
The rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating significant flood risks.
“It is expected that the total rainfall from Lower California to northwest Sonora will range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm,” reportsweather.com.
Rose will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, get to Arizona early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue to pass through Arizona, and late Tuesday evening will reach South Utah.
“The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is the heavy rains in Lower California, the northwest Sonora and the southwest American desert,” reports the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to lead to life - threatening rain floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountainous region.
Midsomer-Norton attack: Four people were arrested for murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after they found a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds in Somerset.
The wounded teenager was found in the Exselzoor Terras area at Midsomer Norton at about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, reported to Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asked to respond to anyone who can have any video recording of these events on the phone.
Trump says that Cavanano has been “suffering the masculinity and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The voice of Judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party, ” stated Trump at a meeting in Wilingu, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanano had been “dangerous and angry” to the Democratic Party throughout the hanging process.
Cavanano gave a witness before Congress on Thursday, fiercely and emotionally contradicting Christine Bleezi Ford's allegations that he had committed sexual violence against her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave evidence of the charges brought against her.
On Saturday, the President stated that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliantness, character and courage of” Kavano.
“The voice of Judge Cavanano is the voice of one of the most advanced lawyers of our time, a lawyer with the irreprehensible experience of public service, ” he said to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President spoke of Kavano's promotion as he spoke of the importance of Republican appearance in the medium term.
“The five weeks from now will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m really running, ” he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the mission of the democracies is to “oppose and obstruct”.
It's expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavano's candidature will take place not later than Friday, informed CNN of one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds died from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number of casualties is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away in the ocean when huge waves crashed on the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulaves, and the authorities declared the country’s authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in the city of Palau on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) high in the dusk fell on the shore, beating many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 points.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and did not immediately begin to flee, and they were victims, ” stated BNPB, a representative of Indonesia’s disaster management agency (BNPB) at Jakarta.
“ It wasn’t just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on land, ” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had passed through the open sea at a rate of 800 km/h (497 mph) before it hit the coast.
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed and survived, adding.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
Aerophotographies published by the disaster management agency show that many buildings and stores have been destroyed, bridges have been turned and destroyed, and mosques are surrounded by water.
Postiles in a coastal city continued on the Sabbath.
A series of earthquakes felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Applications (BPPT) stated that the energy released by a severe earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy generated by the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city at the end of the long, narrow bay could have contributed to tsunami force, said the agency.
Nugrojo called the damage “wide-scale” and pointed out that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found in the wrecked buildings, and he added that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugrojo noted that the victims and injuries could be more than 300 km (190 miles) along the coast line north of Palma in an area called Donggal, which is closer to the earthquake’s epicenter.
"The lines of communication were completely damaged and we didn't get any information" from Donggal, said Nugrojo.
It is home to more than 300,000 people, says the Red Cross statement, and adds that its staff and volunteers have left for the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger, ” says the report.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palau, although officials said that the waves were at the time of warning.
The amateurs that people shared on social networking show how a man on the top of a house shouts violent warnings of tsunamis approaching people on the street under a building.
A few minutes later, the wall of the water crashed into the bank, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't check the real footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power cut that cut off the connection around Palm, which made it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
Military personnel began sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, reporting to authorities, but evacuees still desperately needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has been opened for help only, and it will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centres in Palau on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's too bad.
World Vision staff from Donggal have safely reached the city of Palau, where they hide in tarpaulin wires installed in the courtyard of their office, but along the way they have seen the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they'd seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
That's too bad.
Even when relief teams began to act decisively to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with great experience were not allowed to travel to Palau.
According to Indonesian rules, financing, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if disaster is declared a national disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a provincial catastrophe, ” said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been given."
The second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those who had not yet been found were still expecting their loved ones to be a miracle that would adorn these grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken from the sewers.
On Sunday the rescuers received a woman lying under the rocks for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Hendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian National Paraplanerism Team, trained two missing paraplanists to participate in the Asian Games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanners who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandag, were his disciples.
“ As a senior paraplanary, I have my emotional burden, ” he said.
Hendon tells us how a few hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to the community of paraplanners, he desperately sent messages to the opponents of Palu who had participated in a beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray mark, not with double blue marks.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
The thieves took $26,750 to fill up the ATM in Newport on the Level
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was running a Newport on the Leve, reports the news to the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man "sucking up behind to a fellow Brink" and stole a bag of money to fill up.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects fleeing the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of participants.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport Police at No. 859-292-3680.
Cania West: The rapper changes his name to E.
Reper Canier West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, when he announced a change on Twitter, he wrote, "Early officially known as Kanier West."
The 41-year-old West called E for some time, and he used this shortcut as a name for his album released in June.
The change took place on the eve of his appearance on the Sunny Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaces Arian Grande's singer, who canceled her participation for “emotional reasons, ” reported the show author.
It is not just a reduction of the professional name that West used to say that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe that "e" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible that means "you," said West earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with the radio lead Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Cany, which means "one," was reduced to just Y-- it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanier is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Deade, P. Diddy and Grandpa, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brothers Love.
A former colleague of West, JA-ZI, also experimented with dashes and capital letters.
President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use an army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the massacre of students.
On Saturday, at the Lopes Obrador Square, Lopez Obrador promised “never to use an army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, the military shot a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people, and left student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to students and opening more free State universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
US$ needs to double funding in the area of artificial intelligence
Because China is increasing artificial intelligence activity, the United States has to double the amount they spend on research in this field, and it's seen as an investor and practice in the area of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were given after various parts of the U.S. government made applications for AI, although the U.S. has no formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it wants to become No. 1 for innovation in AI by 2030.
“A double budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Double funding can double the likelihood that the next major achievement in the AI field will be made in the United States, said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "The Nations of the AI: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hoghton Mifflin Harourt, is the director general of the Sinovation Ventures Foundation, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous companies of AI in China.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Melon, he was working on an AI system that won the best American player at Otello and was later executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee noted previous technology competitions conducted by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when they would be next to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations," he remarked.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring university lights in recent years to work on AI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. to increase efforts in the area of AI.
“I believe that Green Card should be automatically offered to AI science candidates,” he said.
The Chinese Council of State published its Plan for New Generation’s artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to persons who work in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners from industry and academic circles, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in I Next.
With regard to the National Science Foundation, it is investing in the research of AI over $100 million a year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, who wanted to create the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, took no steps for months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country’s name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to “North Macedonia Republic”, which would allow for a long-term dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of a northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments made a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalistic opponents of the agreement argue that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the turnout of the 50 percent voters would allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the referendum bulletin is, "Do you support NATO and EU membership if agreement is made with Greece? "
The advocates of a change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaire, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that formed after the break-up of Yugoslavia, should pay for membership of bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they may live freely under the influence of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79 - year - old Oliver Georgievsky in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament have said they will support it to make it decisive.
Changing the name will require two thirds of the vote in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported before 1: 00 p.m.
However, only 16 percent of the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters threw their ballot papers into the polls, compared to 34 percent.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe”, stated 62-year-old Guose Tanevsky in the capital city of Skopje.
On September 30th, 2018, in Stromica, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dosko gave their vote in a referendum to change the country's name, which will open the way for entry into NATO and the European Union.
Before Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and placed chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through a service door,” Kavardark stated. “
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaire believes that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
“I believe that the majority will vote in favour, since more than 80 per cent of our citizens speak for the EU and NATO,” said Zaire after voting.
He pointed out that the "yes" result would be evidence of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia, 30 to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma, 57 percent of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they'd vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be valid, it has to be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government since its beginning last May.
See, Serhio Aguero of Manchester City goes all the way to Briton's defense and kills the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rachim Störling had passed the Bryton defense and had won Manchester City with a score of 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Hol Aguero in the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker got a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Briton's supporters and found himself in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went around one defender, then ran around a few more at the edge of Brighton's fine.
Then he made his pass left when he saw Sterling.
The English Forward made the first touch to give Aguero's ball, which, with its right shoe, launched it into the right side of the gate, defeating the Bryton holoker Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” said the director of the City of Pep Gurdioll.
We arranged for him to play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he hit a needle at this moment."
But the initial advantage of the sky-blanched in this Premier League match was that of Sterling.
That goal happened at 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep in Briton's territory.
He sent a beautiful crossing belt along the left flank of Leroy Sana's.
Leroy made some notes, and then he made his path to the far-off pants.
The sky-blanched Forvard dropped the ball at the gate just before he slipped off the border.
The City will meet Hoffengham at the team stage of the League of Champions at 12:55 Tuesday at the Rhine Neckcar Arena Stadium in Zensheim, Germany.
Sherryr wants to take the points off Roques.
Since Washington Nasnalls has left the play-off team, there was no substantial reason to wait for another start.
But Scherzer's competitive tendency is expected to come out on Sunday at the Pitcher's match against Colorado Rokis, provided Roquis still has difficulty getting out of play-off, and now Roquis is one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodger's in the West National League.
"Rokys" has at least a Wildcard for victory with a 5-2 score over "Nashionals" Friday night, but still wants to secure the title of the first division.
"Despite the fact that we're playing for nothing, at least we can leave the ball, knowing how the viewers behave here in Denver, and another team is probably going to play the highest level I've ever seen in this year.
Why don't I want to take part in this competition?
Nachionales will announce who's gonna be a start-up pirate on Sunday, but they're told they're going to bend to be Scherzer.
Sherzer, for whom this is going to be the 34th start, on Thursday, he's had a pizza session and can play Sunday, his usual day off.
Washington's right-wing is the result of 18-7 out of 2,53 ERA and 300 strikes of 220,2/3 Inning at this season.
Trump meetings in West Virginia
The President recalled the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano when he spoke of the importance of the arrival of Republicans in medium-term elections.
"All we've done will be put on the map in November.
Five weeks will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don’t run, but I really run, so I fight everywhere I can, for the great candidates, ” he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power, using whatever means you can, you can see the vileness, the mess.
They don't care who's suffering from them, who's going to have to go through to get power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them."
The mission of the democracies, he said, was “to oppose and obstruct”.
“And you see it over the last four days,” he said, calling the democracies “wicked and mean, disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned the Senate's Judicial Committee, calling the senator-democracy Senator Diane Fainstein by name, which prompted the audience to hear loud cries of discontent.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you give me the document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was really the bad language of the bodies -- the worst language of the bodies I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an extensive church.
It is not tolerant of those who express themselves.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last of those members of Parliament who were told that they're not happy, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated almost the same way because she was determined to oppose anti - Semitism.
I was convicted because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbin.
As to the importance of responsible economic policy on national security in Europe, these questions are ironicly similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the conference of the Lebourists Nottingham East on Friday says, "We want meetings to be intrusive and productive."
Most of the evening Friday meetings of the General Committee during my eight years as a local member of Parliament from Labourers were like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of a more kind, softer policy has long been forgotten if it's ever begun.
It's becoming increasingly obvious that the Labour Party has no different views and that every thought is evaluated from the point of view of whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the Party.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader, and the people I thought I had such political views started to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept positions that I would never agree with, whether it was national security or the only EU market.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t matter what I say — it follows the tobacco of social media attacks calling for revoking, condemning center politics, I’m told I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I've been sent are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face daily sexist or racist attacks but who never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become a norm.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Labour Party should raise a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer so broad a church, and with every movement of mistrust or change in the rules of selection, the party is narrowed.
During the last two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been told not to hang out, not to speak loud enough so that I can be “all right”.
But that's not why I came into politics.
I joined the Lebourists 32 years ago as a high school student, because because of the lack of attention from the government, Thecher, my high school class was literally broken down, since then, I've been trying to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether it's a local adviser or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East was puzzled by my political views and differences with my current leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday events, I just want to say one thing: I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, both members of the Labour Party and not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to call me back and no political benefit will prevent me from doing what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Air: Unconquered Air rises up
The last two attempts may have distorted the final outcome, but no doubt Air deserved a triumph in today's beautiful premiership game of Scotland.
Now they're leading the table, which is the only unconquerable team of ten.
After all, the excellent defense and improved ability to take advantage of opportunities gives the owners and coach Peter Merci the right to be content.
“We have so far been tested by our games, and we are still unconquerable, so I have to be content, ” he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose commented, "I give it to Air," they used better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt at 14 minutes, implemented by Frasier Climeau, led Air forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, published by Verrior, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo reinforced Air's leadership by using the toolbar and made and implemented a solo trial just before the break, giving the Eir account 17-5 for the benefit of Eir.
But Melrose was a very good start in time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay because of the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, who was pulled out of the field on the shoulders, and from the Eir restaurant, they came forward with Stafford McDawell's attempt, which was implemented by Climo.
Captain "Eir" Blair McFurson had a yellow card then, and another Melrose forced another player to pay the unrealized attempt of Bruce Colvin under intense pressure.
The hosts returned, however, when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for Climo's interception without a ball from the line of the jail, McFurson made a tachdown behind Air.
Clim was doing an attempt that he was doing almost every time after the restaurant, and then Kyle Row was hit by David Armstrong in the box and sent the flanger Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the master's team.
It looks like the star of "All Still Game" is set for a new career in the restaurant sphere.
It seems like Ford Kiran's star of "All Still Game" is set up for a new career in hospitality, and that's a conclusion after it became known that he's the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC TV series that he writes to and films with an old comedy partner, Greg Hemfield.
Duet announced that the future ninth series would be the last in the series, and Kirnan seems to be planning his life after Craigng.
According to the official record, he's the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan would like to enter Glasgow's "blossom restaurant business."
Our Peace: Bolivia's inner material hope that the trial will open her way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang the ocean blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with a motto: "Our Lord is right.
We must return it.”
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there's still a memory of the loss of the coast that has left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century because of natural resources, and there's a desire to once again swim in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision on October 1 after five years of trial.
“For Bolivia, there is a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, it looks forward to a positive outcome, ” commented Roberto Calsadiya, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the ICJ decision on large screens all over the country, and they hope that the Hague tribunal will make a decision in favour of Bolivia, after decades of dramatic discussions by Chile, will be forced to negotiate Bolivia's sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his reconquering next year, also puts great hope in a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts feel that the court is unlikely to make a decision in Bolivia’s favor, and if that happens, little will change.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to condemn Chilean territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The decision of the ICJ, made only six months after the final arguments were made, indicates that the matter was “not difficult, ” said Pas Zarat, a Chilean international law expert.
Bolivia’s case has not moved forward, and for the last four years it has been possible to contribute back.
“The request for access to the sea has been used by today’s Bolivian administration,” said Zarat.
Morales, a militant rhetoricist, blew up the remains of Chilean kindness, and she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their dialogue at some point, but it will then be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Wells, Bolivia’s representative in Haazi, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationship with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of difference with mutual benefit, ” he said.
He also denied that Morales, still one of Latin American’s most popular presidents, had used the marine question as a political crutch.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific, ” he added.
It is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
Foreign Minister Rie Young Ho of North Korea says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before Washington can be trusted.
Ree spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfil the promises made during the Singapore summit by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments appeared when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which came to a dead end more than three months after the Singapore Summit with Kim Jong-in.
Ri says that the belief that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition to the United States of America's declaration of the end of the Korean War will one day put North Korea on its knees is an “unreal dream”.
Washington, D.C., is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant disarmament steps.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism, which Pyongyang takes seriously the rejection of its arsenal, which the country may consider the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phanyan next month to prepare for the second Summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive head coverings, which is already on the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you've found what you need.
And Valentino and Tom Brown designers have shown a number of eccentric top-heavy brushes from the 2019 spring-lito collection on the podium of a brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats filled Instagram this summer, and named designers have already sent their dilapidated creations beyond the podium.
Valentino stood out with an extreme billowing hat, with wide-breasted feathers of fields that covered the heads of models.
Among the others are the superabundants adorned with precious stones of watermelons, the witch hat and even the hat-ananes, but they are not to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the variety of original masks — just in time before Halloween.
Many of these multicolored masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lekter than a high fashion.
One creature resembled underwater swimming equipment with pipe and eyeglasses, and another looked like a piece of ice cream that had melted away.
And if you support this serious fashion request, you're lucky.
Stilists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
The upper-cups came into fashion thanks to La Bombi, a straw hat with a width of six inches, which was seen at all from Rianna to Emily Ratagowski.
The cultural brand behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social networks gave the world another creation: a straw beach bag about the size of a model in a dome that carried it.
The yellow-red Rafia bag, with the Bachrome of the Raphia and the white leather pen, was the central element of the La Riviera Collection of Spring-lito 2019 Jacquemus brand in Paris Fashion Weeks.
Luke Armitage's famous columnist said, "In the next summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the influence of designers is so great that it's hard to ignore the demand for prosthetics."
John Edward: language skills are mandatory for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained high standards of education, and in 2018 they again obtained excellent exams that complemented individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which are attended by over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SSRS), and they seek to provide the best level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for their chosen career, and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in the language he understands, he understands it with his mind.
If you speak to her in her own language, she understands it with her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't use just English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's exams show that in independent schools, languages are dominated by high-predict ratings.
In total, 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages got higher A.
Data collected in 74 schools in the SPRS showed that 72 percent of students received a higher A in Chinese and another 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish also received A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now language as a subject for choice is taught in the same way as NTM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and other institutions.
A 2014 survey by the British Employment and Skills Commission revealed that 17 percent of the reasons employers are unable to close their vacancies due to lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for a future career.
As language skills are increasingly needed, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career you choose, if someone learned a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows a number of languages priority over competitors.
According to a 2013 survey of more than 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two - percent percentage (15%).
That's why investing in language education is important for today's kids.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a full - time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn its own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to Britain in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest in independent schools, it is always possible to choose several languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools try to create a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed regardless of what the future holds for them.
Now we can't deny that in the international business environment languages continue to have vital importance for the future of the country, so this has to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, diversity, and perfection to Scottish youths.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts from Lakes in San Diego
The fans who want to see LeBron James' first launch for Los Angeles Lakes are almost there.
Lakes coach Luke Walton announced that James would be playing on Sunday in the first front-seat match against Dever Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's gonna play, it's not settled yet.
“It's going to be more than one and less than 48,” said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakeers reporter Mike Trudll reported that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Leykers Pre-Separate Games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-separate games to prepare me, ” he replied.
Trump Metings in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching today a series of pre-election meetings from Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned meetings next week at Trump, including meetings in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidate that he proposed to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump wants to form support for the upcoming mid-term elections, because the Republicans risk losing control of Congress after voting in November.
At what hour will today’s Trump meeting be held in West Virginia, and how can you see it online?
The meeting of Trumpa in the West Virginia city of Willing is scheduled for 19 hours Eastern today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's rally in West Virginia online on live YouTube.
Trump may refer to the tense hearings that took place this week about the candidate before the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavanano, who is accused of sexual harassment, and about the Senate’s postponement of a week’s election while the FBI is under investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November elections.
President Trump said that these five meetings next week were aimed at “employing volunteers and supporters, because the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand most of what they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” reports Reuters.
“The control over Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, for the busy pre-election season is approaching,” said Reuters representative of Trump's campaign, who refused to call his name.
For the Wesbanko Arena Stadium in Willing today's meeting, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, report West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be the second in the last month of Trump's visit to West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morris, whose rating is behind the polls.
“ It’s not good for Morris that the president comes to raise his profile in the polls, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is dedicated to fighting and with hope on the eve of Sunday singles
After three sessions that ended with a unilateral victory, the afternoon Sabbath forsoms could be exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
A shaky pulse pendulum is a fully invented sports concept that the players really believe, especially in similar competitions.
So when they say the pulse works?
"They were six points ahead, and now four points, so I think we're taking it a little bit like a pulse," said Jordan Spit when he walked in.
Europe has an advantage, of course, four points ahead and another twelve points in the game.
Americans, says Spite, feel a little bit of wind in their sails, and so much of what encourages them, not least the shape of Spita and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each made three points out of four.
Sleeping with his killer blows from the handmade to the grave illustrates an example.
These guttural cries of celebration became louder when, in extending his round, he made a decisive sweat and compared the score to the fourth match after he and Thomas had fallen two points.
His sweat, which allowed them to win a match on 15 holes, met with a similar cry, one that tells you that the American team doesn't seem to.
"You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match," said Spit.
That's all each of these players has left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas have in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe have four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
Molewood was the only couple who didn't do the gods on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to escape the gods on Saturday mornings and afternoons on Fridays and on the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This run and how their energy seems to flow to and from this tumultuous crowd, it makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players other than Flitwood or Molinari to secure the potential victory of Europeans when the sun approaches Le Golf National.
Both of them are welcome on different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about European triumphs.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson divorced Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning Forbola, when he was married to Alex Noren.
One god and two dludgeons in the first nine holes brought the Spaniard and Swedish to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to watch forforms and forsomas in close contact with couples, through advice they give, advice they don't give, and it's interesting to see how a strategy can change in one moment.
Europe is now playing better than a team and has a great advantage on the last day, but this session of force also showed that the U.S. team is committed to fighting what some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with an account of 10 to 6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the closing day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a strong advantage, because after Saturdays and trouts, it's ahead of the United States with a 10-6 account.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari won two wins over the backward Tiger Woods, and now they have four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who's trying to recover the trophies that they lost on Hazelstein two years ago, dominated the American team in morning forearms with a 3-1 account.
The U.S. resistance was greater in force and won two matches but failed to narrow the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points in 12 Sundays to save the trophies.
Flitwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, but he and Molinari (also called Mollywood) after a sensational weekend are only the second pair who won four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
By destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the trouts, they came together to beat up Woods and the American new man Brison Deschambo with an even more effective 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled out two games on Saturdays, showed random surges of genius, but he was currently losing 19 of his 29 games in forbolas and forsams and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who didn't participate in morning trouts, went back to Henry Stanson's partner in trances to get a loss on account 2t1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeke, which is the first and third on the world score.
Europe was not able to do everything in its own way this pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three times, the chief winner, Jordan Spit, and Justin Thomas, set the standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They gained a decisive victory of 2ta1 over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Pauler in the Forbolis and later won the 4t3s with Rory McLoroy in the trouts, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history did the team come back with a four-point deficit in the bruises, although Furick's team needs only night to save the trophies.
However, after a second seat for two days, the Sunday counterattack looks like it's out of their reach.
North Korea says that "neither" will disarm in a unilateral order with no confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was deepening mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would never be able to renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Young Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that last year North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill,” such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear testing site, and not distributing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“There will be no confidence in the U.S. for our national security, and under no circumstances will we be the first to disarm in a unilateral order.”
And even though Ree repeated the familiar complaints from North Korea against Washington's "step-down" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, his statement was important because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization that Phanyan had done in the past.
Rey referred to Kim Chen In and Donald Trump's joint statement at the first summit in history between the real U.S. President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on “the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea is looking forward to the formal end of the Korean War of 1950 - 53, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington, D.C., also opposes calls to weaken the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on `denuclearization at first' and raises pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes `announcing the end of war',” said Ree.
“To think that sanctions can put us on our knees is an unrealistic dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the U.S. early in the week.
Instead, the Minister called attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae In in the last five months and added, "If South Korea were the party to the question of denuclearization, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Despite this, Ree's tone was very different from last year's when he told the General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a human missile" who wanted to commit suicide.
This year at the U.N. Trump, who last year threatened “to destroy” North Korea, commended Kim for his courage in taking action on disarmament, but said that much more would have to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday Trump noted that he doesn't set a time frame for this: "It's going to take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue energetically and without hesitation until we see a complete, final, confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block the financing of Pyongyang nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ree in the United Nations General Assembly and then said that next month he was going back to visit Phinyan to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip had failed.
He left Phanyan in July and commented on what had been progress, but within hours North Korea condemned him for the “Hungster demands”.
During this month's meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to clear the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States is taking “responsible measures”.
He said that Kim said he needed “responsible measures” as security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest
The new Harvard university course this year provided all its students with more sleep, and it's an attempt to combat the growing culture of high school all night after coffee.
The teacher found that students at the University of Number One in the world were often uneducated when it came to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Briham Women’s Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start a course after he gave a lecture on the effect of sleep deprivation on education.
At the end of the day, a girl approached him and said, "Why am I being told this in my final year?"
"She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," said the teacher from The Telegraph.
This year’s first - year course explains how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sporting results and improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the university, explained that the university decided to introduce a course after it was found that students were seriously deprived of sleep within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one chapter, there's a picture of a room in a dorm where students click cups of coffee, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deficits on sports performances, and the importance of sleep-related rudders.
Another chapter tells how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, the map of a compass with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change students' behavior instantly.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health consequences of smoking cigarettes, ” added Professor Chasler.
A culture of pride for "night's sleep" still exists, he added, adding that modern technologies and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is increasing.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be a secret weapon for a student to cope with stress, burnout and anxiety, even with a set of unnecessary weights, because sleep deprivation makes the brain hungry, which causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year at Harvard for the first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all graduate students to undergo a similar training program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students remind themselves of the need to go to bed, and to set up a alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Hil Mengi upset Gerard's boys
Raingers survived another flight of grief: Dolly Mengi's strike failed Stephen Gerard's distinguished team with count 1-0 from Livingston.
The Aybrox team wanted to win its first victory at the exit match after the February triumph over St. Johnson with account 4-1, but Gary Holta defeated Gerard second as manager of 18 games, and Gerard's team remained eight points behind the Scottish Prime Minister Harts.
Menga was killed seven minutes before the break, and Rangers, who lacked inspiration, did not seem to be able to compare the score.
Now, Rangers is down to position six, and Livingston is up to position three, and there's only a Hibernian ahead of them in different balls.
In addition, Rangers may experience another problem, since the shitman Kalum Spence was forced to process the head wound after he had been thrown into something from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight changes on a team that had once passed by Air in the semi-final Cup of the Scottish League.
And Holt released the same Levi 11 warehouse that took one point to Harts last week, and was thrilled by the way his forced boys were oppressing the rivals at every turn.
Maybe Rangers was dominated by the ball, but Livingston worked more with the ball.
They were supposed to kill in just two minutes when the first pass of Menga allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gate of Allan McGregor, but the half-protector wasted this great chance by sending the ball past the gate.
Kegan Jacobs got a deep free blow from Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgo, hit the back of his pants.
Rangers really got control, but the last third had more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should be entitled to the toolbar on the sign of a quarter of an hour after the encounter with Stephen Loulis, but the referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian address.
The Rangers were able to do only two strikes on the front gate in the first time, but Liam Kelly's former Aybrox Gateman, the head of Lassanna Koulibali, and Ovier Ejaria's calm blow were almost unsettling.
And while the former head of Livingston may have been at odds with the game, no one can deny that they only deserve it by their hard work.
Rangers couldn't do it again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallaher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Mengu for a simple end.
In the break, Gerard replaced the Coulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked as the coroner went through to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came from his line to block it.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the game they like when Litgou and Halket are playing one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved the outcome in the last stages, but McGreager was a good resister of Jacobs before he hit him from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, replacing Rangers, made another late application for a fine when he encountered Jacobs, but Thomson looked back.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger’s counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and time is coming... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gang" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, specter Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of popiculture, for example, in the 1950 movie Call Coronado with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who are playing questionable, looking like cowboy scientists.
"What is this? "
Rogers: "This is Gaiger's counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear how the radioactive atoms are affected in minerals."
Evans: "Well, it really cracks!"
Ghans Gaiger died in 1945 just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to watch and kill malignant cells
Vaccines teach the immune system how to recognize malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method involves removing the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
And then these cells are able to see proteins that are common to many types of cancer, and then these cells reenter the patient.
A test vaccine demonstrates promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who has received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has lost ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the immune cells in the patient, changing them in the lab so that these cells can see together many different types of protein cancer (HER2) and then re-entering these cells in the patient.
Professor Jay Bersoffsky of Betesda National Cancer Institute, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we've received a very promising vaccine."
"HER2 "solves the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and color cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which is to remove immune cells from patients and teach them to target cancer cells, has worked to treat one of the types of leukemia.
After the launch of the SNL show in MAGA baseball Kanye West, with a sharp speech to support President Trump,
What caused the negative reaction of viewers
The audience at the SNL show (Sunday evening on live air) was revered by Kanier after his sad speech, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would be running for president’s office in 2020.
After doing a third song called Ghost Town in a baseball that says, "Let's bring America back to its former glory," it exploded with a tyrad in which it criticized the democracies and reiterated its support for Trump.
And sometimes white people ask me, "How do you like Trump, he's racist."
Well, if I was troubled by racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show started with Matt Damon's sketch, in which Hollywood star ridiculed Bretta Kavano's testimony to the Senate Legal Committee in the case of Christine Blaze Ford of Sexual Violence.
Although West's talk was not broadcast live, the video and its title put Chris Rock's comic book on social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to mock West by placing this post.
West also complained to the audience about the unpleasant situation behind him because of the head covering.
The West said, "When I was behind the scenes, they treated me rudely.
They said, "Don't go out to the audience in this baseball."
They were fucking me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
West went on to say, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent, and I'll put on my superman baseball, because nobody can tell me what to do, and you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to the newspaper Variety, his comments caused at least twice the negative reaction of the audience in the hall, and the SNL actors looked confused, and one of the viewers said, "There was a dead silence in the studio."
The West last minute was called upon to replace Arian Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapist McMiller, died just a few days before air.
The West caused many surprise by the song I Love it in Perrier’s bottle of water.
West was backed by TPUSA Kendez Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the boldest: I'm grateful for what I've done against CROWD."
Instead, the head of the Tok Show, Karen Gunter, wrote on Twitter that West "is who he is, and that's just great."
"But I won't reward anyone (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art) who I think professes and throws out an ideology that damages my community.
He's a free man.
So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: "the one he used to know as Kanier West."
West isn't the first performer to change his name, and he's following the example of Grandpa, also known as Paff Deade, Paffie, and Pee Grandpa.
The colgaper Snoop Dogg used to be called Snoop Lion, and as we know, the musical legends of the last decades Prince changed the name into a symbol and then became "Artist formerly known as Prince."
Accused of attempted murder after a knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with an attempted murder after being stabbed by another man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident had taken place at the Belligecamore restaurant.
The accused is expected to appear before the Chiefs of Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor's office will examine the charges.
Keith Gerington's star of "The Great Thrones" condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Gerington became famous for his role as a soldier with John Snow's sword in the brutal medieval phentesian series "Gra of thrones" of HBO manufacturing.
But 31-year-old performers condemning the stereotype of macho hero, saying that because of these heroes on screen, young boys often feel that they have to become tough to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that he thought "something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the Hashtag era of #MeTo Ciekaj, #itage, & etc;
A whale that recently married its throne colleague, Rose Leslie, 31 years old, said he's "smartly determined" to deal with this problem.
"I'm now quite determined, when did we get on a slippery path towards idealizing brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach prospective men, if we look at their growing up because of the challenge we see now?"
China believes that television is partly responsible for promoting brutality through images of highly courageous heroes.
He said, "What is natural and what is planted?
Why does TV and the street teach young boys to feel pressured to be such men?
I think today's really important question is, "How can we change that? "
'Cause it's obvious that young guys are getting lost."
In an interview, he also pointed out that he would not be filmed in any penquells and sikvels of the "Grey of thrones" when the show was completed next summer, because "he's done with battles and horses."
From November, Kit will play the play of Sam Shephard's "The True West" -- story of the film producer and his brother-in-law.
As the actor recently confessed, he respects his meeting with his wife, Rose, the best thing he's ever received from participating in the "Grand of thrones" show.
"In the middle of this show, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and defined my future life," said Keith.
In a phentesic show that was awarded the prize of "Ammy," Rose played Igrit, the love of Gerington's hero John Snow.
The couple got married in June of 2018, and the ceremony was held on the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AlDS: China claims a sharp increase of 14% in new cases
In China, 14 percent of the population with HIV and AIDS reported a sharp increase.
According to health officials, there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, which indicates a change in the past.
For a long time, HIV has been spread rapidly in some parts of China through infected blood during transfusions.
However, as health authorities stated at a conference held in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex over time is a serious problem for Chinese LGBT communities.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT is often discriminated against.
According to a study, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men marry women because of the rule of conservative values in the country.
In most cases, transmission occurs as a result of misuse of means of protection during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV drugs, seeing this as part of a solution.
Maxine Waters denies the spilling of senators' data into the network by her regular employee and exposes the harsh criticisms of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denounced allegations that one of her full-time employees had posted personal data on their pages in Wikipedia.
Democracy from Los Angeles claims that these claims are being circulated by political spectators and websites.
"The lie, the lie, and then the more repugnant lie," said Waters on Twitter.
According to reports, the published information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Utah.
The data appeared on the web on Thursday, and they were placed by an unknown person from Capitolia during hearings at a Senate commission on charges of sexual misconduct brought against Bretta Kavano, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court.
Data leaks took place some time after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
The Hill reported that conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, had information that the source IP address was linked to Waters' office and had been able to find data from her regular co-worker.
"These unfounded statements are absolutely false, they're not true," Waters continued.
"The staff member of my office whose personal data and safety are threatened by these fabricated and lying statements has nothing to do with the origin of this information.
These unfounded statements are absolute lies, they're not true."
Voyers' application was quickly criticized online, among other things, by Ari Fleischer's former press secretary of the White House.
"It's a denial full of anger," wrote Fleicher.
"It suggests that with such a character she cannot be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, there is no need to become angry.
The accused should not act presumptuously.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and unsettling."
It seems Fleischer was leading the parallels between Waters' reaction and the critics' criticism of the democracies at Judge Kavano's address, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearings.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republican Party, who is running to take the seat of Waters by election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"That's news, if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Voyers noted that her office had already reported "responsible public authorities and law and order bodies about these false claims."
"We'll do our best to find the guilty," she continued, "and they answered the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of "Agent Johnny Ingles: A New Mission", a passing parody for spy fighters with Rowan Atkinson
It's already been a good tradition to look into every new British film of thoughts named Brexit, and there's a new part of a series of comedy parody on a fight about Johnny Ingles, the first film called "Johnny Ingush" came out on screen in 2003, and later the series was re-established in 2011, taking off "Johny Inglesh: Restart."
Will it become a mocking and ironic self-defense about what we are wrong, the new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny Inglesh, with his moving face and eyes re-exposed, was given the opportunity to become messy, and his name more than anything else indicates that this comical character was created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As we know, Johnny is a cheery secret agent, who, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, is a little bit from Inspector Cluso, a little bit from Mr. Bin and a lot of things from that guy who played one music note from The Fire Wheels at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The character is also foreshadowed by the traveler and the mystery of the international scale that always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in the long - forgotten TV ads of Barlaycard.
In the last movie about Johnny Inglesz, there are some good points.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglesh in the knight's armor was approaching the helicopter, and the shoveled screws were talking about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent to set up a buffet is beautifully revealed, but it's humor, and in some cases it's too much, especially when you compare it to "serious" moviebrands, like "Agent 007" and "Miss impossible", which is also comedy.
It seems as if the jokes are designed for children rather than adults, and I don't feel as ridiculous about Johnny Inglesh as they are for Atkinson's wits in silent Bean movies.
As always, the film begins when Britain is under serious threat.
In Britain’s supersecret network of spies, hackers enter and reveal the names of all field agents, which is a complete surprise to the active agent. ( Unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an emergency role in the film.)
This turned out to be the last drop for Prime Minister, a proud person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is deeply depressed because of his loss of popularity. (Amma Thompson tried to best convey the image of Theresa May, but the script did not allow him to be fully exposed.)
Intelligence advisers informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she had to get one of the retired.
The choice falls on Johnny Ingles, who now works as a teacher in a super-modium and has informally trained children to do rapid work under cover (in this part of the spy's "year cycle" section), Ingly for teenagers, there were several successful jokes.
Inglect is quickly taken to Whitehol for emergency briefing, where he meets again with his patient friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller for another time.
Buff is now married to a captain of an underwater boat (the role of an exaltated tired person does not exactly correspond to the talent of Vicky Pepperdin).
So when everything in her Majesty's Secret Service went straight, "Bethman and Robin" came back into line and suddenly met the fatal woman Ofelia Pistoletov, who's playing Olga Curilenko.
And then the prime minister comes under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who earns his wealth in technology and technology and claims to be able to solve the problem with the British network -- the ominous Jason Volt, who was played by Jake Lacey.
Ingleish and Buff are on their way and are again resorting to their ridiculous protrusions: re-dressed waiters have set fire to a fancy French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally going abroad to Volta’s luxurious yacht; and Inglush has a real mess when trying to use a helmet of virtual reality to learn about Volta’s house design.
All stops lead us to the final episode, but by his kindness and violence, he is like a movie for children.
The movie's going through.
As in other movies about Johnny Inglesh, I asked myself the same question: Can't the British movie industry really offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
The Leibonists deny the preparation of a plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but they'll get paid in five days.
The Leiborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, has to discuss a radical plan that says that the British will work four days a week, but they'll get paid in five days.
It's reported that the party wants to commit company leaders to transfer funds saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence to employees, giving them an extra exit.
Thus, workers will have a three - day holiday, bringing home the same wage.
According to sources, this idea will match the party's economic program and direct the country's resources to support the labor class.
The transition to a four-day workweek was approved at the British Congress of Unions, and it's believed that this would benefit workers from a change in the general economic situation.
The source in the Labour Party reported The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
It's not going to change overnight, but the idea of a four-day work week corresponds to the party's approach to changing the economy's balance of interests for workers, as well as the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Leiborians didn't approve of this idea first, because the Green Party promised to have a four-day work week in the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party now approve of such a desire.
The Speaker of the Labour Party said, "The party's political agenda doesn't provide for a four-day work week, so we're not looking at this idea right now."
"The Dark Chancellor John McDonnell presented his view of the socialist revolution in the economy at the Leyborist Party election last week.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was willing to take back power from the "less directors" of utility companies and "screechers."
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that shareholders of water companies may not get their entire share of capital if the Labour Government leads the "counting" on the basis of alleged irregularities.
He also confirmed his intention to include employees in company administration and to create inclusive stock funds to transfer 10% of the regular private sector firms to workers with annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes (60 minutes) whether an FBI investigation of the Kavano case can change their opinion
In connection with the investigation of charges against Judge Bretta Kavano, who is led by the FBI, the final election for his appointment as Supreme Court Judge is postponed for at least a week, and questions arise as to whether the senators of the Republic will continue to support Kavano after the results of the Bureau's investigation have been published.
In a Sunday show, 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pella asked senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their opinion.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him that I had had a conversation with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and the charges came out, I asked him, "Did you really do that?"
He was firm, firm, non-competitional."
It seems that Graham’s opinion will not change anything.
"I believe that the indictment of Cavanano is provocation," he said.
"Dr. Forde, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Britt strongly denied everything," he added, turning to Christine Blake Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't know what's going to change."
What is Global Crisis Festival, and how can it affect the decline in poverty?
On this Saturday, New York will host the Global Cities Festival — an annual event in the music world with an amazing number of star performers and no less dramatic a mission — to eradicate poverty worldwide.
During the seventh Global Cities Festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to the Great Gallery of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendez, as well as to draw attention to the true purpose of the festival; the organizers seek to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Cities Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Government Project, an international community organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors have to do a bunch of jobs or "works" like learning a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to a world leader, making a call or anything else to help bring attention to the goal of the organization of eradicating poverty.
So is there any result, because it's 12 years left for the organizers of Global Citizen to achieve this goal?
Is it really the idea to reward the act with a free concert -- a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clilitism," where people feel that something is really changing by signing an e-petition or publishing on Twitter?
According to Global City, since 2011, they've recorded 19 million "works" of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to claim planned financial coverts and programs worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 will help to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 financial obligations and public applications as an example of its performance, with at least 10 billion already being collected and spent.
The group estimates that some 649 million people around the world have been directly affected by the cost of living.
Among the main financial obligations are the Power of Nutrition Foundation, which is territorial to Great Britain, and as part of the project, investors and implementers committed themselves to helping children grow up and promised to help Rwanda to cope with the problem of malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Cities.
"With the support of the British government, the gentlemen, governments of other countries and citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a small fact of history," said the representative of The Power of Nutration Tracy Ullman, speaking to the public at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "works" that called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project to improve the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?"
Global City wrote, "It's a long and difficult way, so sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
But, like members of civil rights movements and antiapartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, the group The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Gianll Mona is just part of this year's star performers at a festival in New York and led by Deborah-Lee Fernness and Guy Jackman.
The Minister of Internal Affairs stated that the U.S. could use naval forces to prevent the export of Russian energy
According to a U.S. Minister of Internal Affairs, Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington's Washington Examer, "if necessary", Washington can seek assistance from the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the markets in the Middle East.
Zinke stated that Russia's involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts on the invitation of a legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to be an intermediary in energy trade, as they already do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"Thanks to the U.S. Navy can provide free passage by sea and, as necessary, block them so that Russian energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that claims to be “the voice of every consumer” in the United States.
He then compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy efficiently and replace it with alternative energy," he said, calling Russia "one-sided" because its economy is dependent on mineral energy.
While these claims were being heard, Trump’s administration set the goal of increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by pushing away from the Russian energy market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To that end, the Trump administration and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the “unsatisfactory” project to build the road line "North Stream 2," which Tramp said would make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the gas pipeline "North Flow 2", which costs $11 billion and doubles the capacity of the existing gas race to 110 billion cubic meters, is an economic project.
The Kremlin is convinced that Washington is vehemently opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure-driven tool and consumers should be able to select suppliers," declared Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Nowak after meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused Germany's negative reaction, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization German Federal Union of the German Industry (BDI) urged the US not to become involved in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Union of the German Industry, after the last meeting of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts "seriously think" about running for president in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Worren of Massachusetts stated on Saturday that "seriously think" about a presidential election after an intermediate election.
In a public meeting in Goloc, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of presenting her candidature.
As The Hill Warren reports, "It's time for women to go to Washington and get the government done, and for that to happen, there must be a woman in his head."
"After November 6th, I'll think seriously about standing for president."
In a public meeting, Warren expressed her appreciation of Donald Trump's presidency, stating that he "will lead his country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was candid, critical of Trump and his offer to judge Bretta Cavanano.
Warren wrote in a Friday tweet: "... undeniably, the FBI should conduct an investigation before the vote."
But according to the Friday poll, most Warren voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey carried out jointly by the Saffolka Center for Political Studies and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential voters in Massachusetts expressed their opposition to a senator's appointment.
Thirty-two percent supported the promotion.
The survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, and 38% said against 48% for the potential promotion as president.
In discussions of other prominent democracies who can run for election in 2020, they're also called former vice president Joe Beyden and senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to Asociated Press, Byden announced that he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Paylyn mentions PTSD Trek Paylin during a meeting to support Donald Trump
Trek Peylin spent a year in Iraq after he entered military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident occurred on Monday night.
"What my son's going through now, which makes him go back home, can only understand other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are returning home with," she said to the participants in the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Paylyn called Trek's arrest "a problem that no one cares about" and said her son and other veterans of war "go home less than they used to be, more brutal, and want to know if they respect what their fellow soldiers, pilots and other military personnel have done for this country."
According to the spokesman for Vasilla Police Department, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assaults on a woman, and also for obstructing reports of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol.
18 states and districts in Colombia support the challenge of asylum policies
Eighteen states and circuits in Colombia have supported a challenge to the new U.S. policy whereby victims of banditry and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to NBC News, 18 state and county representatives sent an analytical note to a court consultant in Washington to support an application that needed shelter and tried the policy mentioned.
The full name of the case of Grace v. Seshs under the American Civil Rights Defence Union, which has been challenged by federal policy and filed in August, is not revealed.
The plaintiff said that her partner "and his brutal Bandite sons" beat her, but U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
It was illegally held in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace's lawsuits stated that the people of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees of which often seek asylum in the United States) often face serious problems, such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status cancels the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014 that undocumented immigrants could seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, General Carl Reissin, declared during his Friday speech that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that the decision to apply for refugee status be based on a review of the facts and circumstances set out in the application, and the prohibition violates this principle," is stated in the advisory note of the court.
Then, in an analytical note, prosecutors argue that policies that prohibit immigrants from entering the U.S. are damaging to the economy because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill needed jobs."
In June, Attorney - General Jeff Sachns issued an order for immigration judges to say that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
"The shelter is given to persons who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with race, religion, nationality, membership in certain social groups or political views," said Sachns during the presentation of the policy on June 11.
The provision of shelter never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers desperately try to find survivors, while the number of deaths in Palau has doubled.
For those who remain alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with fever at the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute quick help brings bodies.
Clean water isn't enough."
Some people return to their ruined homes, take their underground belongings, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 points on the Richter scale were crowded.
Some of the wounded, including two of Geriz’s back and shoulder fractures, are resting outside the Palu Army Hospital building, where patients are helped under open air through repeated pushes.
His eyes filled with tears as he remembered how a strong push shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for rescue.
I think I'm trapped in the wreckage of the wall," he told Awake! correspondent Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife asking for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for "opportunity of psychological pressure" by means of "advertising ads."
A week after the State Chinese newspaper placed ads on four pages of an American daily publication on the mutual benefit of US - Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to promote propaganda.
President Donald Trump of the United States last Wednesday referred to China Daily's Chinese publication in Des Myines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, following China's charge of influencing elections to Congress on November 6, and China rejects these accusations.
According to Reuters agencies officials in the United States, Trump's statements, in which he accuses Beijing of attempts to intervene in American elections, mean a new stage of escalation from Washington, D.C., whose goal is pressure on China.
Although foreign governments can post advertising to promote trade, between Beijing and Washington, D.C., there is an escalation of a trade war in which they have already raised import customs.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of repressive customs in China was intended to strike exporters from states like Iowa who supported the Republic party Trump.
Terry Brenstead, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa State, the largest agricultural exporter to China, claimed that China had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in the Sunday edition column of Des Myines Register, " amplifies pressure by publishing propaganda ads in our independent press."
"To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American people's road to the tradition of freedom of speech and the independence of the press, placing a pay-as-you-go advertisement in Dees Myes Register," wrote Brenstead.
"In contrast, on street maps here in Beijing, you'll only find individual voices of dissidents, and you won't see here a true reflection of what the Chinese people actually think about the development of the Chinese economy, which is a matter of concern, which leads to the conclusion that Chinese media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the respected Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but he didn't say which one.
Analysts warn that the failure of the Kavano Republicans to set up women voters against themselves before an intermediate election
Since many prominent Republicans support and defend a candidate for judicial office in the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavano after having been charged with multiple sexual harassment, analysts warn that this could cause an undesirable reaction to future elections, especially in women.
The situation is marked by passion, and most Republicans publicly state that they would like to move on to a vote.
You can't just play things like that later," said Maxwell Searski University, during an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Rieger, professor of political science.
Riger expressed doubt that the investigation of the FBI, at which Senator Jeff Flake (a resident from Arizona) insisted at the last minute, would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
Kathryn Jean-Perier on Friday said, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning the protestors were singing "The Sky is coming!" during a demonstration on the Juridical Committee, when the Republicans decided to move on to the confirmation of Kavano's candidature, despite Dr. Christine Bleezi Ford's testimony.
In an interview on Stew Rotenberg's news website, an extra-party political spectator, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They say it's right now, and it's true.
However, motivation may increase, especially for women voters between 18 and 29 years of predominance who have not yet been defined and often do not vote if they do not like the president."
Even before Ford testified on charges of being a judge of the Supreme Court in sexual offences, analysts predicted a negative reaction from voters if the Republicans insisted on confirmation.
The former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, said earlier this week, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
According to the news channel director of the U.S. Priorities (U.S. Parliaments) Guy Cecil, "it's not a matter of the committee's vote, the final vote, or Kavano's being in the dock of the defendants, but how they responded to this situation and how they acted."
However, the American views on the beliefs of Ford or Cavanaugh are divided, and Ford has a little more support.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41 percent of respondents believe or believe in Ford's testimony, but Kavano's testimony believes or rather believes 35 percent of the respondents.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that they believed that Cavanano had given or was likely to give false testimony, whereas 30 percent of the respondents said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after Flake’s urgings, the FBI conducts an investigation of charges made by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week Ford gave a testimony under the Senate Legal Committee's oath about Kavano's assault on her while intoxicating herself when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez stated that the candidate for the position of judge of the Supreme Court had shown her his genitals at a party at the University of Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to launch a "new Internet" to create competition between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Internet, is launching a new startup to create a competition between Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is developing an open source Solid platform, which is an idea by Berners-Li.
With the Solid platform, users can choose where to store data and who to access information.
In an exclusive interview, Last Company Berners-Lee used to joke that the purpose of Inrupt is "world domination."
'We must do it now,' he said about the startup. –
It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create "personal online data store" or POD.
It can store contact lists, lists of current activities, calendar, audio library, and other tools for personal use and operation.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify at the same time in one browser.
A unique feature of this personal online data store is that it fully meets the needs of a user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities through data."
According to director general Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to use resources, processes, and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
At present, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several full-time developers hired to work on the project, and a volunteer programmer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team didn't negotiate with Facebook and Google about if they should be completely replaced when all of their business models are undergoing radical changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Lee, he wrote that Inrupt's mission is to "safe commercial energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the basis of the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee is an influential figure in the debate over network neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch, Inrupt Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of network development," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration on the presentation of the Church of the Order of the Cross of Victoria during World War I
The only member of the Church of England who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria for participating in the fighting during World War I is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded a prize to participate in the Belglance and Leokour attack on September 29, 1918.
However, he died of a sniper bullet four days later and never learned that he had received Britain’s highest military reward.
On Saturday two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire County.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called "extremely symbolic" that the opening of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather had won a victory for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann transferred his Battalion through St. Catherine's channel "a very dense fog and under a dense fire of field cannons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the point of fire, and with "sudden bravery" he took a step forward, one broke into a field gun and destroyed three enemy unit cannons.
Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little over a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vane said that his grandfather had done something he could never have done and that he deserved respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann put a crown after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud of being involved in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero shows the honor that so many people tell him."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206's tournament, but instead they were shown "Pepp's pig."
Imagine that you don't sleep all night just to watch Bellator 206's event-filled tournament, and you're being denied the opportunity to review the main event.
There were 13 fighting events in the offices of the San José tournament, including six major programs that were broadcast live at night in Britain on 5 channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, just before Hegard Moussy and Rory McDonald were preparing to get together in a fight, TV viewers in Britain were dying of surprise when a Peppa pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcast.
Some viewers were not thrilled because they did not sleep until early in the morning while waiting for a fight.
One fan wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him "some sort of bad joke."
"In accordance with the Government's decree, content broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they had to launch a child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Public Relations Bellator, when asked about television;
Pappa pig, yeah.
The president of Bellator Scott Coker promised to work on a broadcast schedule to reach viewers in Britain in the future.
"I think if we talk about resurrendering, we can arrange it," said Coker.
"Now it's Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the broadcast was turned off, we had a lot of messages that we answered, and the text was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical problem, and we tried to eliminate it.
However, it was found to be in conflict with governmental regulations.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to send a signal to the fans, but we've put these attempts on hold for now.
It's a really bad situation."
Disert Islanddiscs: Tom Daily felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation.
The Olympic jumper in the water, Tom Daley, tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't understand that "not everyone looks like him" until he went to high school.
By participating in the Disert Islanddiscs broadcast on Radio 4, led by Laurent Laverne, he noted that he spoke frankly about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also stated that it was because of parental care that the victory at the Olympic Games became less important.
The chairman, Kirsty Young, has been in the hospital for several months for a long time.
When he came as a couple to Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "bader" than others when he was a child, because "society didn't take it when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "So far, the sense of inferiority and difference has been exactly what gave me strength and strength to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove that something was worth while, so that he didn't disappoint all those who finally learned about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympics has become a well-known LBGT community champion and has taken advantage of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was honest about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and he wanted to give that "hope" to others.
The world’s three - time champion admitted that his feelings for a man, American film director Dastin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, were a real surprise.
Daley married an Oscar laureate, 20 years older than him, last year, but according to him, the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're going through so many things at such a young age," (at the first Olympic games he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also have experienced such fall and fall.
In June, the couple had a son called Robert Ray Black Daily, and since then, as Daley said, his "general perception" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would only think that I should get gold," he said.
"You know, there are things far more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said that his father couldn't accept the idea of the end and asked if they had bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because they wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, "you won't sit in the front row because you'll be gone," said Daley.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually ceased breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and gained bronze.
"I knew it's what I've been dreaming of all my life: diving before my countrymen at the Olympics, and there's no feeling better about it," said Daley.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song — Proud (Gord) in the performance of Gezer Small — which resonated with him in preparation for the Olympics and still causes ants.
Disert Islanddiscs is released on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 English summer time.
On Saturday, Michaelson was taken out of the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup in a tournament, but he has to restore his uniform so that he doesn't get unhappy.
Michaelson, who participates in a two-year-old tournament on the record 12th time, took Captain Jim Frick out of the game during the course of fornics and forsams.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-time winner built up the team all day and trained himself on the side, hoping to control emotions.
Because Michaelson wasn't famous for being a good hit even while on the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete didn't exactly fit for a tough golf course for Le Golf National, where Raphe is usually punished for wandering blows.
And if the field isn't that bad, then in the ninth match on the Sunday, Michaelson will have to meet with an Open Championship champion and master of an accurate strike by Francesco Molinari who, together with Tommy Flitwood's new boyfriend, won all his match this week.
If Americans who lose three points after 12 single matches start well, Michaelson's match can be decisive.
Frick expressed confidence in his athlete, and he probably had nothing to add to.
"He fully understood his role today, slapped me on my back, hugged me and said that tomorrow would be ready," Frick said.
"He doesn't doubt his powers.
Michaelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, which has done so much for teams last week and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I've predicted more matches, but that's what happened, so we decided to do that.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anyone else."
If Michaelson goes to the field on Saturday, he'll beat up Nick Faldo's record, who's the biggest match player in Ryder's Cup.
This is where he can complete his career at the Ryder Cup, which never met his individual achievements.
In Michaelson's account, 18 wins, 20 defeats, and 7 night outcomes, but Frick said that his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
"He's funny, he's mean, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's
"I think the younger players had a good time finding him, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows there's nothing going on.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant break in front of a single match on the last day of the tournament for "Ryder's Cube" does not guarantee victory yet.
Dancian debuted in 1997 in a match at the Walderram Club, where a team led by Sev Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but won a match with a slight cut with a result of 141⁄2:131 ⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in the match on the Walderrame field; a big break in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the Walderram field where we won hard," said Bjorn after watching the winning games Class 2018 with the result of 5:3 Friday and yesterday at the Le Holf National Stadium, after which the break was 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing is solved.
We'll have to play with the best of luck tomorrow.
Go to the field and do what is necessary.
The game will not be over until the result appears on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophies, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're well aware of who we are against, the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of its players in a complex field, Bjorn added, "I'll never run ahead.
Tomorrow, things might work out differently.
Tomorrow we're expected to have individual matches, and that's something else.
It's great playing in the field with your partner when it's going well, but it's when you're standing there alone, and you can test what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to set up players to speak tomorrow: at the limit.
You leave your partner without support, and now he has to show you what he can do."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number, Jim Frick, is waiting for his partners to play better on an individual level, except for Jordan Spate and Justin Thomas, who have won three points out of four.
By the very end of the day, Frick's fate was coming back from different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created "A miracle in Medina."
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Krenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, organized the players before the last day of the race.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as was done in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves on to someone’s side, the players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We put the players in the team accordingly, as if we were going to, like, do something incredible tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to try to lead a counterattack against Rory McMilroy, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter are on the first half of the European team list.
"The partners themselves, and in this order, I've chosen because I want to share efforts evenly throughout the game," so commented Bjorn for his choice of players on individual games.
The introduction of a new German warship was again delayed
The most modern German Navy frigate was scheduled to be operational as early as 2014 instead of the old Cold War war battleships, but according to local media, this will not happen until at least next year due to malfunctioning systems and increased spending.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, received from the spokesman of the Military Department, the main ship of the Bayden-Württemberg series was set aside for the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery undermined the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Würtemberg class, which the naval office ordered in 2007, have to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
Clearly, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of antiaircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some reduction technologies, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is the longer period of maintenance, and it's expected that new frigates will not be able to return to the port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit warn that because of the continued delay, super - modern warships that were to increase Germany’s military capacity at sea will also become obsolete at the time of exploitation.
The Long-Strike F-125 frigate came into the headlines last year when German naval forces officially refused to bring the ship into action and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a warship has returned to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
The reasons for the return are not well known, but German media have mentioned the significant software and equipment effects that made the warship unusable for military operations.
The failure of the software is particularly significant, because the crew of the Baden-Würtemberg ship is made up of about 120 sailors, only half the number of military personnel who served on the old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the vessel has a significant excess of weight, which makes its performance worse and limits its possibilities for further modernization.
The Rhineland-Phaltz frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7,000 tons) of ships of the same class as those used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to broken equipment, the total cost of the project was another problem, which includes the cost of training the crew.
Expected 2.2 billion euros turned into huge 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion).
Problems with getting new frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings of the collapse of German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, the authorized Bundestag on the Armed Forces of Hans-Peter Bartels reported that in the Navy, the country had “a small number of ships capable of carrying out combat tasks”.
The official stated that the situation had worsened for some time, since the old ships had been out of service and the new ones had not arrived.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Würtemberg class were able to fill the Navy.
The National Trust will observe the secret life of bats
A new study, which is being carried out in the area of land tenure in the Scottish Highlands, aims to determine how bats use landscapes in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to ensure their preservation in the future.
In In Inverius Gardens in West Ross, scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will observe species such as the netopir dwarf and the pygmy netopir, as well as the ears of a common and watery night.
Special registries will be placed in strategic locations in the area of land ownership to observe bat behavior during the season.
Workers and volunteers at the National Trust in Scotland will also conduct mobile tests using hand detectors.
An experimental analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and appropriateness of bats ’ calls.
Then it's planned to develop a detailed map of animal habitat and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a nature counselor at the Scottish National Trust, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of conservation measures (e.g. meadow formation) and determine how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the last century, bats have declined significantly in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened with intensive construction and rehabilitation of areas that deprive them of nesting sites.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, glued fly paper, chemical treatment of building materials, and domestic assaults.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, hunting at night helps them to catch prey more effectively than eyes.
They use sophisticated echoing techniques to detect insects and obstacles to flight routes.
In Scotland’s National Trust, which provides care for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special significance, and 76,000 acres [760,000 ha] of land throughout the country, bats are taken seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly investigate, inspect nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, and it's located in the area of Trive in the Damfries and Galloway region, where eight of the 10 species of bats live in Scotland.
The manager of the facility, David Thompson, claims it's an ideal place for them.
"In the site of Tribes, excellent conditions for bats," he assures.
"Here are old buildings, many giant trees and other favourable living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot more about bats, and with the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we're going to be able to learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it's very important to test the area for bats before any technical work is done, because the unintentional destruction of one nesting site can kill up to 400 female babies, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats and their nests are protected by law.
Elizabeth Ferrel, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Center, urged the public to join the organization.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we haven't yet discovered the characteristics of populations of many species."
Ronald has rejected charges of rape, and his lawyers have prepared claims against the German edition
Cristiano Ronald called the charge of rape "unique" and stated that people "try to attract attention" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information about suspicions.
Catherine Majorga, an American woman, accused the Forvard of Congregation Portugal and the Juventus football club of rape in 2009 in the hotel room in Las Vegas.
As Der Spiegel reported on Friday, Ronald allegedly paid her $375,000 for her silence.
A few hours after the indictments were made, 33-year-old Ronald turned to 142 million fans of his video broadcasters at Instagram, calling the corresponding messages "unreasonable."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander," the five-time Lord of the Golden Ball.
"They want to attract attention by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to profit from me, but situations like this are part of my job.
I'm a happy man and I'm all right," added a football player with a smile.
According to Reuters news agency, Ronald's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Deer Spiegel for published charges, which they call "unacceptable reports of privacy suspicion."
A lawyer, Christian Shehrtz, stated that a football player would seek compensation for “moral damage in size that corresponds to the seriousness of a violation which is probably one of the most serious cases of personal rights violations in recent years”.
It's claimed that this incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after meeting at a nightclub at Ronald and Majorg, he returned to the player’s number where he was allegedly anal rapes her, and such testimony was handed over to the Clarke County District District Court in Nevada.
Major claims that after the incident described, Ronald fell to her knees and said that he was "99 percent good guy" and had "one percent".
As noted in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but with mutual consent.
Major also claims that she turned to the police and then went to the hospital where the injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to a court settlement because she was "fearing revenge" and was careful of "public humiliation."
Now, a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel the previous deal because she continues to suffer from an incident that she says happened.
At the time of the incident, Ronald was preparing to move to the Real Madrid FC from Manchester United, and this summer he became an Italian football grand player, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain will long regret the loss of car manufacturers
The U.K. will be forever sorry if we lose the status of world leader in auto manufacturing after Brexit, and this is warned by the economic minister Greg Clarke.
He added that he was encouraged by the announcement by Toypato UK that in the event of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU without a deal, the company would have to suspend the production and operation of its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Minister Clarke assures us.
A Japanese car manufacturer stated that the consequences of the delay on the border in the case of Brexit without a deal could cost jobs.
A plant in Bernaston that produces Toyota models for Auris and Avensis last year released about 150,000 cars, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain left the EU extremely late March, production in our factory will be stopped," Marvin Cook, director general of Toyampa in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Line, are also concerned about how Britain's exit from the EU without a deal to trade internationally.
For example, at BMW, they said that the mini-model factory in Oxford would be closed one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are that Brexit without a deal can cause risks to supply chains.
The Toy® production line operates as part of an operational supply of details and materials according to needs – details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for vehicles manufactured for purchase.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be disruptions on the border in the supply of details, resulting in delays and shortages of materials.
As noted in the company, Toyrate can contain no more than one day of detail, so it's going to have to stop production.
Greg Clark noted that in organizing relations with the EU prepared by Theresa May, “in particular, there are plans to avoid problems at the border”.
"We need an agreement, and we need to make an optimal agreement that I think will not only make it possible for us to succeed at this moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the Today program on BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony given by Toyrate and other car manufacturers, we need to preserve the highly efficient supply chains."
Toy250 was unable to tell how long production would stop, but in the long run, it is expected that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, as a result, cause jobs to contract.
Peter Cvalaris, head of the Unite professional union at a 24-year-old factory in Bernaston, said that the other participants were extremely concerned:
The government representative said, "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan to shape our future relations with the EU."
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, noted at the White House
According to White House representatives on Sunday, the responsible meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "a one more week" while discussing the nomination of Brett Cavanaugh as judge of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Müller, who investigates Russia's interference with elections, links between Trump and Russia's helpers, and potential interference with presidential justice.
For several months in Washington, D.C., the possibility of a deputy attorney general being released would jeopardize Müller’s independence.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had commented on the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of an early termination of the president's authority for the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House in the background to report that the officer was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he wouldn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a match with the Senate Juridical Committee meeting at which Cavanano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Bleezi Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into charges against Cavanano, which added to the Senate vote.
Spokesperson Trump, Sarah Sanders, performed on Fox News Sunday.
And when she asked me a question about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "It's not meant to be scheduled for this week, and I expect her to be postponed for another week in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I'm always watching to see if the press has the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not conduct a briefing for the media in the White House since September 10.
The chairman, Chris Wallis, asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of frequent briefing was not due to the hostility to "public games" by television reporters, although he added, "I won't deny that they play in public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
"The president gives answers to questions more often than any president before him," she said, adding, without reference to the source, "Statistics speaks for itself."
Sanders said that the briefing was still going to take place, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the U.S. President, that's better than talking to me."
We're trying to communicate with the press a lot, and it's going to have to be particularly visible over the last few weeks, and the ability to talk to the U.S. President is no worse than a press conference."
The Trump regularly answers questions from outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences with high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rare.
In New York City this week, the president may have shown why this is so, by acting in front of journalists in a fascinating way and at times surprising.
Scottish State Secretary of Health wrote to EU employees for fear of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health wrote to citizens of other EU countries working for the National Health Service in Scotland to express their appreciation for their work and to ask them to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to cover the cost of applications for permanent resettlement status for EU citizens who work in autonomous government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said, "We've had discussions between Britain and the EU over the course of the summer on how to get out, and we have to wait until this fall for solutions.
But the British government is strengthening preparations for a possible solution without a deal.
I know this can be a very disturbing time for you.
That's why I'd like to stress again how much I appreciate each employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Groups from across the European Union and beyond share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving health services for patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay."
Christian Ebercrombie suffered an emergency surgery after head injury
Christian Ebercromby, a member of the Tennessey State Tigers team, suffered an emergency operation after receiving head injuries in a Sunday match against the Vanderbilt Comodorce, which his team lost with the score of 31:27.
The chief coach of Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player had been injured shortly before the break.
"He came up to the side line where he got angry," said Reed.
Following a side line, coaches and medical personnel gave Ebercrombie oxygen before taking it away for further testing.
An official of the Tennessee State Tigers team informed Chris Harris of WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercromby had been operated at the University of Wandbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "until there's evidence of the type and severity of the injury," the Tennessee State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-year student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after the transition from the Illinois team.
He did five rounds of ball on Sunday before he got out of the game, so he's got 18 grabs in his season.
Foreign buyers will pay more State tax if they purchase real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more money in the event of the acquisition of real estate in Britain, and according to Tori's new plans, additional funds will be spent to help the homeless.
This action neutralizes all Corbin's attempts to involve young voters.
Higher State Customs Will Be Costed by Those Who Don’t Pay Taxes in Britain
In the Ministry of Finance, an additional £120 million a year is expected to be used to help the homeless
As Teresa May announced today, foreigners buying real estate in Britain will pay more money, and additional funds will be spent to help the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to involve young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing for highly paid workers.
The promotion of customs will involve individuals and legal entities who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the government will aim to help those who are forced to sleep in the open sky.
An additional tax, accompanied by a two - year increase in housing and real estate, may be three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, an additional £120 million per year is expected.
Experts estimate that 13 percent of the new real estate that is being built in London is owned by foreign citizens, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who only dream about their own housing.
Many wealthy parts of the country, especially in the capital city, are empty because a large number of foreign buyers spend most of their time living outside the country.
The new plan of action was only a few weeks after Boris Johnson had called for a lower State customs to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying land without further using it, and he urged Theresa May to give up the quota of available real estate to fix "the debauchery of the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of important real estate reforms, such as rent control and non-refoulement without good reason.
He also suggests expanding the authority of local councils in the area of new housing.
Theresa May said, "I promised last year that I would give my prize to the restoration of the British dream -- for every new generation of life, there must be a better one.
This requires change in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always remain open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
It is not fair, however, for individuals who do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to buy housing under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own housing has become unattainable, and the problem of living under the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross, "I want to be the main coach in Scotland."
Jack Ross, the chief executive of Sunderland's FC, claims that "most of all wants" ever to lead Scotland's assembly.
A 42-year-old Scotsman started to rebuild the club from the northeast of the country, which is now the third place in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stedium of Light this summer, bringing back the last season of the Saint-Mirren FC in the Prime League of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to Scotland's second assembly, but it's over," said Ross during the Sportstown program at BBC Scotland's radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of the congregation in Scotland at the Hempden Park Stadium."
The only hope for me is to be successful as a top coach of the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland FC were Dick Lawyer, David Moiss, Sam Ellardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gustavo Piet and Paolo De Canio.
Former head coach Alloa Atletik states that he didn't feel any emotion from moving to a big club to follow such authoritative names by rejecting the proposals from the FC "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town."
"At the current stage, I think I'm successful if the club returns to the Prime League.
Thanks to its structure and its material and technical support, this club is no doubt in line with the level of the Prime League,” he said.
"It'll be a challenge, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be successful."
Ross has been building a career as a coach for only three years, and he's been a second coach at the Dambarton FC, and he's spent 15 months at the Garts Training Staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover after the FC got to the third division, and in the next season from St. Morris went from the flight stage to the winning title of the first division.
Ross says he's more comfortable now than he's ever had in his game career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Fulkerc, St. Morris, and Hamilton Academy.
"I'm at the raceway," he says, "I'm on the road to "Alloa."
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more appropriate for me than a gamer.
That sounds strange, because I was successful, I was good at it, and I got some heights.
But it's not easy to play.
There are many challenges that we face each week.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as a principal trainer, I feel in my place.
I've always been interested in training, and I've never felt as comfortable in my entire adult life as I did since I chose this profession."

Research: 5:30 a.m. — A perfect time for a beer cup
Summer heat helped increase the profits of British pubs, which were not the best of times, but increased pressure on the network of restaurants.
Sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant income fell by 4.8 percent.
The author of the calculation, Peter Martin, of the CGA business consulting organization, said, "Thanks to solar weather and longer than expected for England's participation in the World Cup, July passed by the same pattern as the previous month, when pubs' proceeds grew by 2.8 percent, and then restaurants got worse.
The June drop of 1.8% in July increased.
Drums and bars, which are drinking-oriented to date have the best performances — increasing their incomes is equivalent to losing restaurants.
The food - served pubs also suffered from the heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that only a drink is of interest to visitors.
In controlled pubs and bars, the sale of drinks per month increased by 6.6%, while the sale of food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at the RSM Recreational Business Department, said, "Several trends we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and large - scale social or sports events remain the main factors affecting domestic sales.
It's not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to lose their profits, and the annual decline of sales by 4.8 percent is a particular concern in the background of the need to reduce costs.
The long, hot summer is not the best time for food supply facilities, and we'll see if we can keep the temperature we saw in August to give them such needed rest."
The general increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new institutions, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slow increase in new brands.
The Coffer Pach Tracker's global sales indicator in the pub, bar, and restaurant sectors of Great Britain is a reflection of the compiled and analyzed performance of 47 working groups, whose aggregate product is over £9 billion, which is a commonly accepted industry standard.
1 out of 5 children has a social network account hidden from their parents
According to the study, 1 out of every 5 children aged 11 or older has an account hidden from parents and teachers on social networks
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram
This news increased concern about the possible location of sexual content
20% of students said they had a "core account" that showed their parents
One out of five children, sometimes under 11 years of age, creates an account on social networks that is hidden from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram, a social network for the exchange of photos.
The news increased concern about the possible location of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "core" account that showed parents, and one or more private ones.
The mother, who accidentally came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw the call to rape me.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools revealed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles in social networks. Half of these children recognized that the additional account was secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said, "We're very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel they want to create an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Alyd Doyle is going to be "a member of the athlete's interests" in the Scottish Athletics council.
Elied Doyle has been elected to the Council of Scottian Athlettics as an independent director during the annual general board of board members.
Doyle is the most advanced youth in Scotland, and the chairman of the Council of Yen Beatty called this a great opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of its broad experience gained at the international level over the past decade.
"Aileid enjoys great respect among athletes in Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that by getting her into the council, athletic sports in Scotland will be of great benefit," Beatty assured.
Doyle said, "I'm inspired to act as an athlete, and I hope I can really benefit and promote sports in Scotland."
The American, a four-time Olympic champion who won the 200- and 400-metre race in 1996 in Atlanta and now is a sports watcher for BBC, has lost the opportunity to walk through a transit chemic attack.
He wrote in Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much I could do.
Thanks to extraordinary efforts, I have been able to recover completely, and I have learned to walk again, and I am doing dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for your words of support!"
In advertising, the women's milk sucker was compared to cows - Internet users' thoughts were divided
The milk-absorption manufacturer faced a mixed response from Internet users to advertising, where young mothers are compared to real cows.
In recognition of the release of a product called "the world's first silent milk sucker," Elvie's consumer technology company released a humoral music video ad to demonstrate the freedom that a new sucker provides to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cow's song, which contains the words, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have my tail," and "As you can see, it's not a wreath, but my breasts."
And then the chorus goes, "Suck, suck, feed, suck, suck, suck, suck, not waste milk."
However, an ad on a Facebook page caused a heated discussion online.
The video has got 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the Internet user response has been ambiguous, and many people have noted that advertising underestimates the "fright organization" of milk production in industry.
"It's not a very wise decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but their children are being taken away from them a few days after they were born,” wrote one of the users.
Elvie milk sucker can easily be hidden in a breastal for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "I realized it was traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you use them to advertise milk suckers for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone else said, "This ad is far from reality."
The other users were defending the ad, and one of the women's videos was "very fun."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If she still had breast - feeding, she would have bought such a thing.
By sucking up the milk, I felt really like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I didn't find any hidden meaning in it.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "A funny ad directed at moms who suck up milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This ad is not intended to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk suckers hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on information that many women who use similar foods feel like cows.
However, Elvie's sucker works perfectly quietly, has no wires or tubes, and is easily hidden in a nursing bra, which allows women to move freely, keep their children, and even walk out the street.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive director of the Mother advertising agency, commented on this situation: "Elvie's sucker is so revolutionary that he demanded a vivid and provocative presentation.
After a parallel between women sucking milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breast-feeding, in an exciting and interesting way, showing the incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker would bring.
Elvie's sucker is not first found in news headlines.
Within the framework of the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product as she showed the clothes from the modeler Martha Yakubowska.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, partly because harsh rhetoric and politics from Trump administration have made it difficult to place children in caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, immigrants themselves took the lead without documents, and now they're afraid to endanger their own ability to stay in the country by offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk went up in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week Matthew Albens, a high-ranking Bureau for Immigration and Customs Control, testified to Congress that the Bureau staff had arrested dozens of people who had applied for care of minors without escort.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 percent of the people who are caregivers or members of their households are in the country illegally, and many of them are foreigners who committed a crime.
That's why we're continuing to persecute these people," Mr. Albens said.
According to asylum workers, in order to deal more quickly with children's cases, officials have introduced new rules that require some of the children to appear in court within a month after being detained, not 60 days later.
Many of them will be able to use a video call instead of coming to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who are not entitled to asylum by court decisions will be deported quickly.
According to asylum workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children are kept in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Law - enforcement officials claim that these problems are intensified in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say good - bye to our friends, we are at risk of exacerbating the trauma many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Also speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Walid Al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though war was ongoing in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally present in Syrian land under the pretext of combating terrorism, so "referring to them will be appropriate."
"They must go immediately and not make conditions," he declared at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war on terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He stated that Damascus would continue "this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
About 2,000 military personnel in Syria have been deployed, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar Al-Assad.
More than 1,000 soldiers were sent to the war - torn country of France.
In the case of refugees, Mualem assured that the country had created proper conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" of spreading baseless fears that prevented refugees from returning.
"We've been calling on international societies and humanitarian organizations to help people come back," he said.
"We observe an attempt to politicize a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not help Syria to rebuild the country until a political agreement has been made between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
United Nations diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlib, the last great fabric of the rebels, created an opportunity for further political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish agreement, it has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province of three million people.
However, Mualm stressed that the agreement had "serious terms" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters associated with Al-Qaida to the Front al-Nusr, who would be "cut off."
The UN Emissary, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee, which will include representatives of government and opposition, in order to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and create conditions for the holding of elections.
Mualem raised the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, stating that its work should be limited to a “review of articles of a valid constitution” and warned against interference.
Why the Trump Will Be Reelected
According to this logic, Trump may be converted into 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, he does not form the authority immediately after a scandal and impeachment.
No doubt it would be “the most dramatic conclusion of the presidency ever!”
At present, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of prime-time viewers has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddown Show has reached the peak of a rating of 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when the main news is discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our comprehension," said Neil Behr, executive producer of the drama "Last candidate" on ABC's channel about the Secretary of State who becomes President after the destructive attack on Capitolia.
Nell Scowelle, an experienced Humourist writer and author of "Fine Things Better: And a few hard truths about the entry of Hollywood men into the club" suggest another theory.
She recalled a trip to Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he laughs at me," he said, "that's the story Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos is entertainment.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington's stories are able to determine the future of Row v. Wade's case, the possibility of the reunification of immigrant families, and the state of the world economy.
Departure is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed citizens when you're watching six hours of Bob Woodworth discussing the use of "well-informed" sources for his book "Strach," Paul Manafort's jacket from an ostrich skin for $15,000 -- as described in The Washington Post -- and the results of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy published by Storm Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never again become an ex.
"The sense of reality shows is partly linked to the fact that you are fed up every night with something new," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive director of Heelhouse Entertainment, and author of the TV program "Stars of theліs", about rotations in the acting warehouse and daily narrative turns in the Trump show.
If you allow yourself to miss a single episode, you'll have to give up hopelessly.
When I was able to meet Mr. Fleis in his house on the northern coast of Cauai, this week I had warm, sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't break away from the TV -- not when Brett Cavano appeared before the Senate Juridical Committee, but the future of the Supreme Court hung on his hair.
"I remember when we created all those crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleas told me.
"I took it as a joke, but I think they were right."

Externally putting funds into the harshest inter-elections to Congress
It's not surprising that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania there are extra cash spills, because by reviewing the boundaries of the electoral districts, two valid congressmen are fighting for one chair.
A democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lemb, who won another district in an additional election last spring, is fighting for this recently changed suburb of Pittsburgh.
Lemb is against another valid congressman, the republican of Kit Rothfs, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are largely the same as the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old boundaries of the regions had been defined in favour of the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The pre-elections in the new 17th district have caused a fierce confrontation between the financial units of the major parties, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee for Conventional Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
The name Lemba became very famous in Pennsylvania after a victory with a minimum advantage in the 18th district during an additional election to Congress in March, which was used by the public.
President Donald Trump won 20 points in this district.
Political experts have given little priority to democracies.
The U.S. considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but they changed their minds.
Diplomats were reminded of the weakness of Washington’s resistance to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and before that, Trump also had a hotel in Panama until the partners withdrew staff hired by Trump Organization.
The officials of the Department of State decided to call off the heads of United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions about Taiwan's ignorance," declared the Spokesperson to Gezer Neuert at the beginning of this month.
But the sanctions were addressed only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million of American aid in 2017, particularly in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
According to the results of the internal meeting, North - Central American officials postponed the conference on a high level of security and economic prosperity, which took place last year as a step forward in efforts to keep migrants in the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking government officials had made it clear that they wanted a conference to take place, and in fact, the issue of sanctions against El Salvador had ended.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pens is now planning to address a conference that is scheduled to take place in mid-October, as a sign that the administration considers this event to be very important.
At that, three U.S. messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there were no further hard reports or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's representative at the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, had reported on terms of anonymity.
The information provided was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under conditions of anonymity.
Learn History
The next problem may be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Müller on possible interference with justice by Trump, which provides solid evidence of why public information is available today.
According to reports, as part of his investigation, Muller is checking the possible connection between Trump's campaign and the attack on our voting system from Russia.
If the influence of Congress is changed, Trumpu will have to report to the congressmen as well as to the voters and, ultimately, to the same partyers.
There's a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't want to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, like his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that determines the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to set up a coup d’état against Hitler if only the West would oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is determined by these turning points, and the uncontrolled movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now faced with a number of these broken moments.
What will we do if Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person on whom Mr. Muller's fate depends?
Rosenstein was in trouble when this newspaper came up with information that last year he was offering to secretly record conversations with the president and share his thoughts on Trump's inequality of office.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
"How will we react if the investigation against Brett Kavano, recently initiated by the FBI, turns out not to be thorough or honest, or if Kavano's candidate for office in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite strong accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And first of all, will we, in the medium term, vote for those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported in Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as my ambassador’s house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With such an inheritance, can I not look forward with optimism?"
Norman Eisen, Senior Scientific Fellow at the Brookings Institute, Head of Citys for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Washington, D.C., author of The Last Century: A History of Five People and One House.
Graham Dorrans of Rangers looks forward with optimism to meeting Vienna's "Rapid."
After an amazing trading in Spain at the beginning of this month, winning over the Austrians will give the Scottish Club a good chance of getting out of the G group of the League of Europe.
Because of the trauma of the knee, the defense officer Graham Dorrans was able to play his team for the first time in the season only at the Wilarreal match, which ended at count 2:2, but he believes that the FK Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve more.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a strong team," noted a 31-year-old player.
"We went out on a game hoping to get something and got one point.
Maybe at the end of the match, we could go forward, but in general, nothing is likely to be a fair outcome.
In the first time, the opponent was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation for our benefit.
Thursday will be marked by another major opposition in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not easy, our future rivals have shown a good outcome in their last game, but we can count on the support of the fans, and I'm sure we can give us a fight and get a positive outcome.
The past year has certainly been difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself, but now things are normalized.
We have a great warehouse, and all the guys are happy.
I hope we can move on, leave behind the last season and succeed."
Women Lose Sleep in Fear of Pension Savings
Even though the pollers had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few people talked about it with their family.
About half of the people who were involved in Nationalside research said they were talking to their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked about it with the kids.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't want to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalside Unit on Life Insurance.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: Your family will not be able to provide you with necessary care if you do not inform your parents beforehand.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to receive care, because this choice can be an important factor in determining cost.
Involve a financial adviser — he may suggest a way to cover the costs.
Funding for long - term care includes traditional insurance policy, a hybrid policy of cumulative life insurance, or self - support at your own expense.
Prepare legal documents carefully so that legal difficulties can be avoided in advance.
Prepare confidence for a representative who will control your health care and ensure that experts follow your wishes if you are not able to do so personally.
It is also recommended that we develop confidence in money management.
Select a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and pay the bills if he or she fails to act.
Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs emergency medical care, so he is taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?

I don't know who's looking after the dog.
Prepare a plan like this."

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, reports government officials, but the number of casualties may increase.
Because of the break-up of the communications system, officials working on humanitarian aid can't get any information from the Dongal Regent, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the 7.5th magnitude of the earthquake.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palau.
Consider a few basic facts about the city of Palau on the island of Sulawesi and Dongal’s Regent.
Palu, the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, is located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800, according to figures for 2017.
When the tsunami hit, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regeneration that extends over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast line on the northwest side of Sulaves Island.
According to a 2017 report, there are some 299,200 people in the Regent, an administrative region located in the lower part of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
The mining of nickel is also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to an Indonesian disaster relief agency in the last 100 years, Palau and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, and then nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismicly active Pacific fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
The following are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in the province of Aceh.
2005: At the end of March, in early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude earthquake of 6.8 points south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra, an earthquake of 7.6 magnitudes occurred.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - point earthquake hit one of the Mantaway islands near Sumatra and caused tsunamis to rise to a height of up to 30 feet [10 m], killing dozens of villages and killing some 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Poddjaya Regent in Aceg Province, causing destruction and panic because people had not yet forgotten the devastating earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the debris of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless homes, and thousands of tourists were unable to leave the island immediately.
Sarah Peylin’s eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Treka Paylin, the eldest son of former Governor Alaska and vice president Sarah Paylin, were arrested on charges of assault.
According to a Saturday report by Alaska State Police, 29-year-old Peylin from Vasilli, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with preventing reports of violence and opposing arrest.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took her phone away.
According to KTU, Paylene is in charge of a 500-dollar Insulator of Matanuzka-Sustina.
He was sued on Saturday, where he declared himself innocent when he was asked if he confessed his guilt, reported online.
Paylin is charged with three A - class offences, which involve arrest for up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with class B misconduct, which is punishable by a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that Peylin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Paylyn, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and also was prevented from reporting domestic violence and carrying a gun intoxicated when that incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her on her face.
In 2016, Sarah Peylin was criticized by groups of veterans for justifying her son’s violent behavior as a post - traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia an earthquake caused tsunamis, killing hundreds of people
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - point earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Networks and electricity are out of power, and the number of casualties can increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near the center of Sulawesi Island, to the northeast of the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The video on social networks shows the moment the elements hit.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palau when a tsunami hit a beach.
Federal prosecutors require a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York
In New York City, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Syfullo Saipa, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City, which resulted in eight deaths, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
It has been said that in October, 30-year-old Sayip, driving a home-leased pick-up truck, went on a bicycle track along the West Side road, Lower Manhattan, and started beating the cyclists and pedestrians who happened to be on their way.
In line with the report of the intention to secure the execution given in New York State's South District to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intently” killed eight people and “intently” caused serious bodily harm.
According to court records, each of these counts involves the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Juries charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight charges of murder for the purpose of extortion, which federal prosecutors usually make in cases involving organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, who described the crimes committed by Saipas as “terrorous, cruel and malicious”, this attack is the result of“reasonable planning and pre-thoughtful intent”.
The victims that Saiful Habibullaewic Syapov injured, injured or killed were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevez, Anne-Lor Decadt, Darren Drake, Aryel Erlich, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Paglonco, as described in the purpose report.
Five of the dead were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the last murder case in New York County.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers, and was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal execution was carried out in New York in 1953, and a couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union two years before the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov’s judicial records, a native of Uzbekistan did not show a guilty conscience in the days and months following the attack.
According to police officers, he told the investigating officer that he did not regret what he had done.
According to Saipe’s indictment, he was inspired by the video IDIL he was watching on his phone.
The police report that he also asked for an IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He did not confess guilt for 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipa, said that they were “very disappointed” by this decision of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
"We believe that the decision to seek death penalty rather than accept guilt confessions and sentence life imprisonment without release will only increase the psychological trauma caused by these events to all victims," said Patton.
Saipah’s defense party had also asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
A member of Parliament from the Conservative Party believes that NAJEL FARAJA should be appointed to be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Conservative Party assembly, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the People's Army."
The former leader of the United Kingdom's Party of Independence stated that politicians should feel pressure on themselves, because one of the deputies of the Parliament, Theresa May, offered his candidature for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boon, a member of the Conservative Party, claimed on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "done" if Mr. Faraj were Secretary of Brexit.
The attention to Mae's problems in trying to reconcile her deep-seated ranks was even more drawn by the fact that the members of the Conservative Party who opposed the withdrawal joined in a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying hard to put into effect the Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks by Brexit, those against exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will not give up trying to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force the Eurosketeers and the Labourers to choose between what it offers and "haos."
At a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solikhal, Mr. Boone said he wanted to "absolve Chequers."
He invited Mr. Faraj to come out of the shadows and take responsibility for the talks with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have come out," he said.
Welllingborough's parliament said, "I'll support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We fought in world wars not to be subordinated.
We want to pass our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected the assumption that after the vote in 2016, public opinion changed, "The idea that the British had changed their mind and refused to go out is completely wrong."
A member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to reporters, "I'm just saying, "The Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers plan is not popular among the general public, opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists, who are actually walking through the streets and fighting for voters' voices.
Please put away Chequers and start listening."
In a speech to Theresa May, she added, "The Prime Ministers retain their position when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraj stated that politicians should feel pressure if they were going to give up the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"It's now a question of trust between us, people and our political elite," he declared.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say that they're not going to get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, which is planning to betray Brexit, to feel pressure.
We are mobilizing a national army of this country that will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, opposers passed Birmingham and then held a two - hour meeting in the center of town.
Several activists waved the Conservators v. Brexit when the group started this weekend.
The Leiberist Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives because security problems arose after the conference opened.
"These are people who tell us that they can use IT systems and technologies necessary for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
Nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "seriously think" about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would "seriously think of a presidential election."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the general meeting in Western Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts spoke about his future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is fighting in November for a second term against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dyel, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is regarded as the main candidate that can fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she had her 36th meeting with the general-congregation voters since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to take part in the presidential election.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and get the government done, and for that to happen, there must be a woman in his head."
They arrested a suspect of gun-killing S.S.L.T.S. basketball player.
At the Baton-Ruz police, Louisiana, it was reported on Saturday that on Friday, a suspect was arrested in the murder of a basketball basketball player called LSU Tigers by Wade Sims.
The Baton-Ruz police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in Eastern time.
On Friday they published a video recording of the shots, asking them to help identify the person on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead at the Sautern University campus on Friday morning.
"Waid Sims was shot in the head and killed," declared 247ports to police chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wade fought for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found at the scene of the crime, carrying weapons and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to police custody in East Baton County.
Sims, who was six feet and six inches tall and who was performing in a youth league, grew up in Baton Rouge, and he played 32 games with 10 stars in the last season, and spent an average of 17.4 minutes on a field, and he was taking 5.6 points and 2.9 pickers.
Lewis Hemlton cut back on World Championship after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettel.
From the time that Walter Bottas left behind Lewis Hemilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes ’ command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well from the post office and almost passed by Hemilton, who tried to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
The Fettitel went to the pit stop first and left Hemilton on the highway in the tail of the race, which was to solve everything.
Mercedes' pilot drove another circle and went out behind Feckel, but Hemilton broke out into the leaders after a certain wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre, resulting in the failure of the Ferrari driver to leave the internal space because of the risk that he would be squeezed, after a two-way manoeuvre, he managed to escape on a third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstapen started from the back row of the net and stayed in seventh place until the end of the first circle.
He took over most of the race because he did not change the tire to quickly come to the finish and move Kim Rykonnen from the fourth place.
In the end, he stopped at the pit stop on the 44th wheel, but he couldn't increase the pace at the last eight, so Ryckonen sat fourth.
"It's a heavy day, because the Knave was laid out full on every weekend and showed grace when he let me pass.
The team did an exceptional job to sit first and second," Hemilton said.
The Language of the Body Was Not Impressed
At the meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Fainstein for her firm stand that she did not publish the letter to Christine Bleisi Ford, who accuses a candidate before the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavanao of sexual violence.
During a rally in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony to the Senate Juridical Committee, but instead expressed his opinion about what happened in the Senate, which he said was a human "silence, improbableness and lying."
"The only thing that could have happened, and all the wonderful things that have been going on in the Senate for the last few days, is anger, you see the evil people showing the vileness, the disgustingness and the lies," he said.
And they said, "Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Remember?
Dian Feinsine, did you share information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the contents of the documents?
Oh, no.
I didn't declare it."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't do it," he added, copying senator behavior.
In July, Fainstein received a letter of detailed charges from Ford v. Cavanano, and in early September its contents were announced, but Fainstein denied that the leak had taken place in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't disclose the information received from her," said Fainstein to the committee, reporting The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promise."
But her objection seems to have been distasteful to the president, who commented during the Sabbath meeting, "I'll tell you, the language of her body wasn't impressive at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone hold on to the worst."
In continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual violence by three women, the President assumed that the democracies were using charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power in whatever way they need.
You see being mean, being ugly, they don't care who gets offended, who has to go through to get power and control," Mediaite quotes the president's words.
"Dandi Stars" -- "Belphest Jayants," 5:3
"Jayants" player Patrick Duyer threw two jabs in a match against "Dandi"
Dundee Stars was rehabilitated for a Friday defeat in an elite league from Belfast Jayants, winning Saturday match with account 5:3.
"Jayants" got an early preference for two jabs thanks to Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowley.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney aligned the bill in the home match, and then Duyer took the Jayants forward again.
The Dundee player, François Bush, compared the score, and Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two heads ensured their victory.
This is the third in the elite league season to defeat Adam Kephas' team, who won the voluntary victory over Dundee with account 2:1 p.m. on Friday night in Belfast.
This is team meeting four in the season.
The first Shaibu Duyer was dropped for a fourth minute (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall McFall, and then four minutes later, Bowley, who received a chess from David Rutherford, doubled his bill.
After a tense first period of 14 minutes (13:10), Sullivan returned the owners of the fields to the game, and at 16 minutes (15:16) Couni, after receiving a jaib from Matt Markwardt, compared the score.
Duyer gave "Jeanths" priority before the first break, by throwing his second jayb at the end of the first period.
The owners of the fields regrouped, and Bouchar at twenty - eight minutes (27:37) rebalancing the score by throwing down the jayb when his team was numerically dominant.
Thanks to the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he first led the Dundee forward and ensured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the "Jiantz" team, who's already lost four of the last five games, will play a pick-up match against Milton-Kins.
Air traffic control died so that hundreds of people on the plane could escape the earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he had spent his life helping to fly a plane with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives after the great earthquake that caused the tsunami, on the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Strong underground shocks continue to rock this area, and many people are trapped in the city of Palu.
But unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antónius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the dispatching tower at Mutiar SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palau.
He remained in place to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then on the airstrip, had risen safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was coming down.
He later died in the hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian Aeronautics Service Provider, Johannes Siraith, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, who is supposed to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that thousands of victims can be reached because the disaster relief agency of the country claims that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims may increase because many bodies are still under debris and many of them cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached a height of six feet [6 m], devastated the city of Palu, where mass graves would be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft deliver relief and food supplies.
Reese Kusum, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News, "Every minute quick help brings bodies.
Clean water is not enough.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Helfand, Chairman of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN, "The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
President Joko Otodo of Indonesia came to Palau on Sunday and said to the country's military officers, "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on Lombok Island, killing more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: According to Air Niugini, after the plane crashed into the lagoon, one person disappeared.
The airline that carried out the disaster in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one person disappeared, although earlier reported that all 47 passengers and crews were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated that one passenger could not be found on Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives try to find a husband and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airlines did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crews after the plane fell on the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials announced that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
At the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew over the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Janes, said that the plane flew very low above the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told us that he and others had managed to get through the emergency exits on a thin plane while in the water.
He told me that the stewards were panicking and shouting and that he had received a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working nearby to upgrade the dock also helped in a rescue operation by delivering people to shore by means of an inflated boat before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safe Network, over the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in airline accidents associated with PNG airlines, but it does not include Air Niugini.
An analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to reproduce the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the murder.
Rollett, reports The Clarion Ledger, said that he received data on the location of several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his earlier statement.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, even though he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pickup that night, Sanford said he was "brighter because my pickup was in Nesville."
Another difference was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Telephone records indicated that they knew each other only a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after his death, Chambers Tellis removed text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Gail said.
The defense must present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be passed on to the jury later that day.
The High Brad: What is a conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling his music with constructive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop changed its nature -- has gone away from political ideas and social issues.
They want to go back to the source and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fegues and Common recently witnessed this resurgence in the United Kingdom thanks to groups like Akala and Lovekey.
Another black skin?
In New York City, the nanny sued a couple for release, receiving a racist message
In New York, the nanny sued a couple for discriminatory release after receiving the wrong message from the mother complaining that she was "other black."
The couple deny they're racists, comparing the lawsuit with the demand.
Lucy Placco-Flacman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw a new nanny, Giselle Morris, who came to her first day of work in 2016, dark skin.
"No, one TEMNOSKIRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flacman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Morris.
As reported in New York Post, aware of her mistake, Mrs. Placson-Flacman felt "unintelligible" and fired Miss Morris, she said that their previous African-American nanny was not doing its job well and that she was expecting a babysitter from the Philippines.
Miss Morris was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is taking a couple to court, hoping that she'll get a pay-a-beneficial compensation, which she would have received for six months of work with a couple who initially hired her, although without a contract, to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them that you don't have to do that," she said Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the charge that they were racists, the couple stated that the release of Morris was a wise decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had been offended.
"My wife didn't mean what she was sent to her.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told Post.
'But would you leave your children to a person you were rude to, even if it wasn't intended?
Your baby?
IT'S OK."
Comparing the suit with the demand, Placco said his wife had only given birth two months ago and she hasn't yet given up.
"Would you avenge someone after that?
It's a bad thing," added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social networks, critical of their behavior and logic.
According to a new letter, Padington’s publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea of a teddy bear capable of speaking
The daughter of Bond Karen Jankel, who was born almost immediately after the book had agreed to print, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of the first person to read the book before it was published.
Now this is funny because we know about the huge success that the Padington story has achieved."
Telling that her father, who was an operator of BBC before a small toy bear, inspired him to write a children's book, was optimistic that his work had been rejected, she shared how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release, she felt "joy and sorrow" at the same time, because his father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud of the book becoming so popular.
"He was a rather modest man and didn't like to boast," she said.
"But Padington was so real to him as his own child!" Because when the children achieve something, we are proud of them, though not theirs, not our own victory.
I think he was looking at the success of Padington that way.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say good-bye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the 2nd Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"On a regular basis, he called, saying that everything was really bad, that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Lapers.
"And then over called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and I should say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Toshi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The drugs that doctors gave her so that her heart could continue to fight gradually ceased and left her body.
She died some time before everything was cut off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I could not mourn, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
She should have really held herself together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperus, who was grieving over her daughter's loss, boarded the plane with other passengers, ignoring the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I dropped my head and couldn't hold back my tears.
This is hard to explain, but it was during my flight that I began to have deep sympathy for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two grieving women leave cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave a telephone number card on the Vallis Bridge, where people can turn for support, as well as messages that they can use to inspire.
Ms. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Leedney, said that her son was a promising cook chief with an attractive smile.
"Everybody knew him for a smile.
They always said that this smile made any room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11 years old, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid that this will have consequences."
Miss Davis created cards so people would know that there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't lock yourself in, you have to talk."
Ms. Humphris, who had been a friend of Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, who had lived with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, that he was depressed or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas Day, he was completely discouraged, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death had become a huge trauma to them, but they had to survive it, "It's been devastating.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm on my family.
But we have to keep on living and fighting."

The future of Britta Cavanano hangs on his hair: The FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could get what we asked – limited time and nature of the investigation – we might have reached some agreement," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the committee was “dwelling” against the eventual loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanano and his respublicists want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is linked to time.
Inter-elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6, and if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will make it very difficult for them to have their own person in the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators to support Mr. Kavano, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush's rule and helped him meet his wife, Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
The Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 democracies, will vote.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice President Mike Pens to resolve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidature as judge of the Supreme Court.
During Kim's reign, the number of northern Korean exiles "shrewd"
After Kim Jong In came to power seven years ago, the number of northern Korean exiles decreased to South Korea, claiming a South Korean legislator.
Pac Pion Seug, referring to data from the Republic of South Korea Department of Union, stated that last year there were 1,127 fugitives compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the key factors were the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, and that smugglers transporting illegals now demand more money for it.
Public comments were abstained from in Pyongyang.
The vast majority of North Koreans are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views fugitives as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally at war, has improved markedly in recent months.
Early this month, leaders of two countries met in Phinny and discussed the denuclearization issue, which had been negotiated in a impasse.
This was after the June historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-in in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Rie Yong-ho, in the background of the sanctions, accused the United States of having no progress since then.
"If we don't trust the United States, we can't be sure of the security of our country, so there can't be any one-way disarmament in these circumstances," Riy Jon-ho stated in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Britta Cavanano "historic" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosí, called the candidate for the position of judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavanaugh "historic" and stated that he was not going to work for the Supreme Court by temperament.
Pelosi expressed her opinion in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Festival in Austen, Texas.
"I've been thinking all the time that if a woman ever acted like this, she would be called "sterist," Pelosi commented on her reaction to Cavano's testimony before the Senate Juridical Committee on Thursday.
Cavanano emotionally denied the charge of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Bleezi Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Cavanano acted very emotionally, and at times he was almost screaming and saying no to talking about his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the democracies on the committee, calling charges against him "absorbed and coordinated by the destruction of reputation" by organized liberals, who were upset by Hillary Clinton's losing presidential election in 2016.
According to Pelosí, Cavanano’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his biased attitude toward the democracies.
"I think that by these applications, as well as his speaking against Clinton and the democracies, he will take his own stand," she said.
Pelosí was indignant when she was asked if she would try to declare Cavanao impeachment, if his guilt was confirmed, and whether the majority of the democracies in the House of Representatives would be granted.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only worth working in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelosey.
Kavano is now a U.S. Court of Appeal judge in Colombia.
Pelossi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about Kavano's possible decisions against the law on affordable medical care or the Row v. Wade case because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of confirmation of Cavanao’s office, the question was raised as to whether he would cancel some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time when the judge will become asteristic, biased person and we will say how wonderful it is," said Pelosie.
Women should possess these weapons.
These were just words that contained months and years of rage, and she could not express them without tears.
"We're crying when we get angry," Miss Stanem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, do you?"
She said, "One woman who was working somewhere as executive director and was very helpful to me said she was crying when she got angry, but she had her own technique, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the householder, "You might think I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
But I am evil."
And after that, she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are seen as an acceptable solution to anger, partly because they are perceived differently.
One of my brightest memories of my first job in an office where mostly men worked was that one day I was crying out of unspoken anger, and the older woman was an inhospitable manager, who I had always been a little scared of, and she grabbed me by the collar and pulled me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an extramarital boat called the Monkey Business, after which he emerged from the race, Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate is the last candidate they needed."
Someone called the situation "The White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was failing in the congregation, so she promised not to take part in the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret their support of $1,000, gave her only $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave the talk, she announced that she would not carry out a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system, which made it very difficult to raise money, and she was forced to focus on the voters differently from the members of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as anger for sexism, and she was willing to cry.
"You'd think I had a breakdown," recalls Miss Schroeder's reaction to the press.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How the U.S. - China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S.-China trade war were desperate, and although far ahead of it, Beijing can benefit in the long run.
President Donald Trump of the United States made the first warning shots earlier this year by taxing basic Chinese exports, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminium.
The biggest situation this week has been due to new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion ($150 billion), which actually tax half of all goods coming into the United States from China.
Beijing was paying back the same coin every time, recently putting a five to ten percent point on American products worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to taking US-like measures, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to miss out on this promise in the near future.
To force Washington to retreat means to accept the demands, but for President Cinpin of China, the U.S. public worship is too shameful.
However, experts say that if Beijing takes advantage of the situation correctly, the pressure in the U.S. trade war can benefit China in the long run by reducing the relationship between two economists.
"The rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic fall in any country, and this is actually a greater threat than observers have admitted before," said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asia-related issues at the Central Center for New American Security.
Minister of Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was "ready" to return refugees
In Syria, refugees are said to be willing to return voluntarily and to seek help in rebuilding a war - torn country that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Foreign Minister of Walid Al-Mualem stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"The real situation today is more stable and secure because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore terrorist - torn areas so that people can return to normal life.
At present, conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that has been abandoned by terrorism, as well as for unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and limited their livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
A further six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian government would be happy to help restore the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional help or help from countries that supported the riot.
Europe anchors the victory on Ryder's Cube in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, when the U.S. team won with a total score of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated six times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in 1993.
Europe returned to its crown when the Danish captain Thomas Björn won 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who tried his best to most of the tournament, struck his first distant blow on the 16th hole steam-3 in the water and gave up Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever been through with a 5-0-0 account since the beginning of the modern tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spite was defeated with count 5:4 by the lowest rating player on the European team Turbier Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world rating, gave up account 2:1 Jan Paulter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of The Ryder, who had already participated in the tournament eight times, became a European who had won all the time in the tournaments, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"Of course I don't cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's team merit, and I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia, without holding back her emotions after her victory in Europe.
He passes on to his fellow countryman John Rem, who, on Sunday, defeated American golf legend of Tiger Woods in a lonely game with account 2:1.
"I feel an incredible pride for winning over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record on the Ryder Cup tour 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 Mayjore tournaments, only giving up Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. congregation spent all weekend trying to reach the field area, except Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed high - school golf throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain Jim Furik said about his team after the unfortunate performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we were briefly dominant over Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the US golf Association and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
They are not to be commended.
We lost."
Active information on red tides: decrease in concentrations in Pinellas, Manat and Sarasot districts
A recent report by the Florida Commission on Fish and Wild Nature reveals a general decline in red - color microorganisms in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, conditions of rich bloom, reported in certain districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasot, Charlotte, and Kolier, indicate a decrease in concentration.
The red - color microorganism extends some 130 miles [130 km] from the north of Pinellas to the southern districts of Li.
The fields can be found about 10 miles off the shore of Hillsborough, but they are less than last week.
A red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, an average concentration was reported in the district of Pynellas and its coastal zone, a concentration from low to high in the coastal zone of Hillsborough, a high concentration in Manat County, a high concentration in the district of Sarasot and its coastal zone, an average concentration in Charlotte County, a high concentration in Li County and its coastal zone, and a low concentration in the district of Colier.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasot, Li, and Kolier, there are continuing reports of exposure to breathing organs.
No such reports were recorded in northwest Florida last week.
