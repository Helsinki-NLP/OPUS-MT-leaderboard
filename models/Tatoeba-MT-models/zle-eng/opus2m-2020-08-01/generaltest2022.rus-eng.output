In my view, the literature programme was designed by ladies of Balzakov age on the basis of their interests.
From 19th - century Russian literature, we preferred Danielska and Volkonski.
They wrote a whitelisty, of course, from the perspective of those same Balzakov ladies.
And the psychology and the torture of Tolstoy and Turguenus are not so interesting to teenagers.
Adolescents are rarely interested in hero psychology.
Thank you so much, very interesting.

Mattex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Mippaket Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has a different rigidity of the sides: the medium-solid surface is formed by a laxated coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft is a plate of natural latex.
The spring block, with 1,000 springs per square metre, is rapidly adapted to the asleep body, preventing the emergence of a "free" or "gamac" effect.
There is a need to highlight breathing materials among the merits of the model.
In the case of paints, which are perforated for air permeability, they are perfectly physiqued naturally, as is the coconut rug.
As a result, there is a healthy microclimate of the bedroom.
An extended guarantee period is also applicable to the mattress.
The length of the official guarantee from the manufacturer is five years, in fact the life of the mattress is longer.
The protection against dust and pollution is vested in the detachable hackard tea provided in the kit.

Germany: Fourth inoculation from the coroner is inevitable
The fourth vaccination would take place in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany would not be final, but would continue with new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of coronaviour vaccine would likely be sufficient to provide full protection.
The head of the Association of Doctors of General Practice, Ulrich Weigaldt, is convinced of this.
This is what Die Welt reports on Saturday, December 11.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will take place in the summer, at the latest in the fall”, the expert considers.
In addition, Weigerdt hopes that the fourth coroner vaccine will be “in combination with flu vaccination”.
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help combat the spread of the new strain of Omicron coronary.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
For example, the risk of re-infection of Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
A preliminary study in South Africa showed this.
On this basis, Biotech / Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies stress that the two doses of vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new version of Omicron coronary.
The study of BioNTech and Pfizer showed that, at two doses, the effectiveness of the vaccine is significantly lower: “neutrality decreases by more than 25 times”.
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against the contamination of omicron Stamp”, stressed Biotech and Pfizer.
A third dose is therefore needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, President of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, is in favour of reducing the interval between second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicrone version of the coronavius.
“The experience of Israel shows this very clearly”, the expert emphasized.
Voltoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as in the Kalikana Vib series) is different from many other images in what was originally created with reference to the use of ice fishing, not just to catch injections.
These images have more than the size of the analogies, which certainly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another feature recognized is the upper part of a firm and obstinate plastic, which creates additional vibrations in vertical and horizontal conduction.
A fairly aggressive game is shown as a "finish wreath" when caught in a bet-A-Vib.
Often the most subtle is simple monotonous animation, i.e. the movement of the sludge up and down, with almost no pause.
In planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient for fishing in a limited area, covered by underwater vegetation, barks and other obstacles for which the trailer is capable.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant for fishing for a winter boat and a large perch, especially in the middle of the winter, when precise and aggressive bait is required.
At the end of the pathway, the Bet-A-Vib will turn around instantly and return to the reference vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also being used for winter trout fishing.
To satisfy its capriciousness, you can choose from two modifications: a noise capsule (NS - NanoSund) or a (SL - Silent).
It was also noted that the Bet-A-Vib has the potential to provoke a passive rat that does not even respond to the stomach.
The Bett-A-Vib capture shows range and accuracy.
This vulder is understood and not capricious, and it's well combined with lek and gossip cords, even large diameters.
To catch injections of rats, boats, cherries or perch, other than uniformly relevant and "step" sometimes with a "bright" on the bottom.
If you're caught in closed places, you can change the front triangle to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of the plugs.
Among the baits of its Bet-A-Vib class are among the most sustainable in the work and, consequently, one of the most catchy.
The same success can be used in relatively small and fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with OWner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries claimed
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries of private military companies (HFCs) in Libya, Wagner.
This was stated on Sunday, 12 December, by the President of the Supreme Council of State of the Republic, Khaled Al-Misri.
“There are currently more than 7,000 mercenaries in Libya, Wagner.
They also have planes.
They also play trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet planes on Gardabiya Airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)” and he is quoted by Anadolu.
Khaled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries were “in an attempt to capture” the central part of Libya, which extends from Chad to the Mediterranean, after “take their human beings to power” in the Central African Republic.
Keep & presence
According to the interlocutor, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “placed in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using airbase and port in Sirte, as well as a airbase in Djufre, is noted in the agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that Wagner 's PMSC has the support of the Kremlin.
Where else mercenaries can be?
According to the agency, Wagner is expected to operate in nine African countries - Central African, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of power installations.
In return for these services, Wagner's subsidiary enterprises receive certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of arms, technology and military services to those countries,” the article states.
According to the media, the Wagners allegedly fought in Donbasa, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not available in the security forces or the legal register, and it is not available on the uniform lists of personnel.
This company is subject to United States sanctions.
Recall that earlier, 27 EU countries had approved repressions against Wagner.
The Council of the European Union is expected to adopt this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Libyan High Council of State is the second House of Parliament, with consultative functions with dominant Islamists, and writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single election day for the election of members of Parliament and Head of State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
“The elections are less than two weeks old, and the chances of them passing on time are rapidly reduced”, noted the material.
Against this backdrop, Libya ' s Supreme Electoral Commission postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely and broadcasts Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy with the eyes of the Russians
Thirty-eight per cent of Russians see the country ' s foreign policy as more successful than failures, and 29 per cent believe that failure prevails.
"Practices of success -- "in Syria, they protected the world, restored the world there," "North Flow 2 decision," "the whole world has been intimidated by what's cool weapons," "Crime We Grieve."
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “union from the world”,” says the Foundation's Public Opinion study.
The Dubai Government has totally abandoned paper business - all civil servants have become digital as well.
The Government of Dubai reported a total rejection of paper-based business and digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirate Information Agency WAM.
“The day marked the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life — we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government”, stated the Crown Prince of the Emirata, President of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan Ben Mohammed Rashid Al Maktum on Saturday.
The internal and external flow of documentation in all institutions of Dubai will now be done only in digital form through specialized information platforms.
The innovation affected the whole industry without exception: health, LCC, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial entities have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to the electronic government and the digitalization of documents began in Dubai from 2018 onwards.
During that time, the authorities estimated that 336 million paper sheets had been saved, representing 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million of monetary equivalent.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobian, had stated earlier that electronic services saved citizens 2 days a year.

The production and export of Turkish vehicles fell below 2020
The production and export of Turkish vehicles declined dramatically in November against the background of the deprecation of lira.
As a result, the industrial performance of the 11 months had been worse than last year, reports Bloomberg, referring to data from the Association of Road Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 vehicles were fired from Turkish factories, 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand vehicles were sent to export, more than 25 per cent of which went back to last year ' s rate.
And while Turkey ' s road sector had shown positive momentum by the first 10 months of this year, the 11 months of 2021 had already resulted in 0.3 per cent of last year ' s output.
The fall was caused by a sharp decline in Turkish lira, which in November cost 29 per cent in relation to the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 IAS entities were deferred on credit payments in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, described the situation in which small and medium-sized business benefits were provided, and transmitted to IIA “Casinform” correspondent.
“As reported by the Agency for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, in response to the request of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 of 9 April 2021 on the approval of the procedure for the granting of deferred payments for loans by small and medium-sized enterprises”, Alyhan Smail wrote in his reply to a deputy request.
He recalled that the procedure for deferment of loan payments had been for banks and micro-financial organizations to defer credit payments made prior to 1 April 2021 to ISA entities, including IUB, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The delay was between 30 and 90 days at the choice of the IAS entity.
The borrower ' s application could indicate a different delay period for payment.
During the stay of the borrower, the claimant was suspended for claim work, notice of the need for payment of arrears, as well as payment by the creditor of commissions and other payments”, noted the successor.
In 2021, second-level banks were requested to defer payments on loans of 603 ICU borrowers, of which 553 IAS entities valued at 9.7 billion tenge were deferred.
In IFI, applications were submitted for a stay of 131 IAS entities, of which 95 entities worth 105.8 million tenge were deferred”, A. Smaillov concluded.
Pulmonologist Purassev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the strain of "Ocmirone"
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity could carry it more easily than those with strong body protective reactions
Pulmonologist Sergei Purassev explained why the strain of the coroner's "ocmir" might be dangerous.
The cause should be sought in the context of the outbreak of the virus.
Scientists believe that Ocmirone was born in the body of HIV-positive or immunodeficiency-affected people.
I mean, he didn't face any immunity resistance at the time of the mutation.
That's why he's more aggressive.
The fact that there was no answer to immunity made it very quick.
I think he's got these packs of proteins, spikes, maybe more than they're supposed to have been cut off during mutations, and he's commenting on the pulmonologist Sergei Purrasev.
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity could carry “Ocmirone” more easily than those with a strong body’s protective response.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens in pneumatic infections, when young people die 30 years old, and old people of the 60's are going through it.
The young man's immune response is totally inadequate: where only a finger could be threatened, he hits like a gun on a sparrow, and concluded Sergey Pursev.
The doctor also recalled that the coroner had dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them were pneumonia.
Light inflammation is bacterial and viral.
If the first one is treated very well and quickly, then the second one often buys only symptoms -- all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the start of intoxication of the body: temperature, weakness, failure.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficult breathing, throat initials, cough.
The pain on the right or on the left, the abominal pain, can also indicate a growing problem.
Meanwhile, by the end of the year, a growing generation between 12 and 18 years of age could be vaccinated in Russia.
A virologist named Paul Wolcov, director of the genetic engineering laboratory at IFTI, noted that this category is very heavily affected by the goat.
Young people who go to school have as many contacts as possible.
It's the most socially active loophole, like kindergarten educators," said "Moscow 24," Pavel Wolcov, a virologist, head of the MFTI genetic engineering laboratory.
The author was so grateful for this article.
I was happy to refresh my memories...
Theath-In.
That long seventy-eight-year-olds didn't cost any dances without the tunes of this group.
And at home, meeting with friends, they used to dance for their music.
Immunologists put forward a hypothesis as to why obese people are the victims of goat
The authors examined the body fat left behind by bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could be infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in fatty tissue, macrophages, have also been infected, with a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists have also examined the fat tissue of patients who died of the coconut and have found coronavior particles in fat surrounded by various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can be hidden in body fat, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid an immune system response.
It's probably also possible for SARS-COV-2.
A biologist told of the causes of dementia
Simeon Goloshekin, a candidate for biological sciences, described the causes of dementia and the ways in which it was prevented in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from the disease.
The syndrome manifests a gradual loss of cognitive functions - in time, people find it difficult to navigate even in familiar settings.
Goloshikin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurogenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social exclusion and lack of active cognitive activity could play a role,” he said.
Dementia is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disturbances, and low - speed lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and decrease abstract thinking.
"There is discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor," added the biologist.
In order to prevent disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical loading and training in cognitive skills and skills that require memory and logic.

Egypt returned some 30,000 illegal artifacts from Egypt
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return some 30,000 artifacts that have been smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Restituted Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Ancients of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has been able to recover 29,300 artifacts.
It was not until this year that 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C.,” he said.
Abdel Gaud clarified that all smuggled artifacts were recorded in archives.
Department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts “track auctions around the world and Internet sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector explained that upon return, cultural values were restored and then displayed in museums.
He said that one of the returned artifacts was the ancient skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find Pharaoh Tutanhamon's auction in London.
On 4 July, Christie's auction house tendered the budget over 3,000 years old for $5.97 million (about 680 million roubles).
This caused resentment on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
Tutanghamon's head, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, has been kept in a private collection and has not been on display since 1985.
How the relic came into Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively seeking to repatriate illicitly removed monuments of ancient times in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the smuggling of ancients is the result of archaeological research by “black miners”.
“Not taking into account the Crimean Tatars”, which is correct because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an autonomous people (near to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people - so many Tatars - live in Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tartars are a separate people, and the name of that people is two words.
Only the Turkic language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile staff
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writing the Financial Times.
In Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communications devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications operator.
Under existing regulations, the bank may look at information from corporate devices issued to its employees as they are used to deal with business matters with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to verify mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if the staff member has used them to meet a client who has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved to remote working conditions, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to deal with business issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has fixed a deadline before which staff can read the new rule.
There is no official comment on the new requirement in Credit Suisse.

Part 4
The last year of Sergeia Esenin's life, 1925, was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for a poet on earth and his "ego."
He's already outside of any literary associations, he's been fanciful, he's on his own, but he's famous, he's supposed, he's at times strongly criticized, even maliciously, but the public reading is ready to carry him on his hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them real masterpieces, the "Prime Motives" cycle completed, the Anna Snegina poem was written, and eight books were published, and the "Russia of the Soviets" was published.
And the main success is at the end of June of the 25th year, the Stateman entered into a contract with Essen to publish his works in volume 3.
None of the modern - day Sergey Alexandrovich poets have received such honor, he's the first!
In addition, the money was very good, with a contract fee of 1,000 roubles per month for 20 months (the factory manager, for example, received 300 roubles per month, the engineer 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Esenin married Lion's grandson Soofie Tolstoy, and had to train the family home, support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as her mother.
Life would seem to be a good place to enjoy, but for him everything is mostly dark, as if a nightmare from the Black Man (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Esenin) had been materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm really, really sick.
I don't know where the pain came from.
Will the wind whistle?
Above an empty and deserted field,
It's like growing in September,
It's drinking on her brain.
Many people have noted that Esenin has given up a lot, looks bad, and is obviously sick.
There's been more and more noises, more and more nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just in alcoholism...
However, if the diagnosis is alcoholism, Sergei Alexandrovich has been treated, there is no reliable documentation left.
Let's say, concerning May 1923, when Essen, at the request of his fourth wife, American women, Aysedra Duncan, was in a hospital in Paris with Professor Petra Hannuškin (a new Esenin will be in Moscow two years later).
And here's the evidence of poet drinks, of scandals on the ground, of the police forces, of the tens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, a terrible affair of a poet with a green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Essen settled briefly with a friend named Ivan Starcov.
Amazingly, Esenin, with his very good incomes, had never had his own home in Moscow or Peter, and he had access to rented apartments, hotels, or acquaintances.
The old man remembers:
"He only came to sleep at night, and in most cases he was in an unconscious, intoxicated state.
On one occasion, on his way back at four o'clock in the morning, Essen fell on the stairs...
Falling down, scratching his face and screeching.
After he came around for a while, he started coughing all over the rest of his blood.
Yes, Esenin himself, after the war in Europe and the United States (the U.S. had a dry law at the time, but Duncan took a good supply of alcohol with him), confessed:
"I didn't see anything there except kabakovs and streets...
I'm done and people stop remembering...
Well, I was drinking, of course...
And I was drunk because the threshing had gone off."

Mattras Promtex-O direct Duet Latex Econom 100x1995
Promtex-O direct Duet Latex Econom is the modern execution of the budget model in the line of the premium.
The mattress's base is a block of independent double springs Duet.
A smaller, softer, small spring is inserted inside the spring.
This allows the burden to be spread evenly on the mattress.
On two sides, the mattress is filled with artificial latex.
It's the equivalent of natural latex, but it's denser and less expensive.
The flexibility and flexibility of this material enhances the good quality of the mattress.
He doesn't drink moisture and dust.
The mattress will fit perfectly with a large difference in weight (of 30 kilograms).
Because of smart springs, there's no wave effect here when the light partner runs to the side of the heavy.
A nice, soft-tempered chichol from a practical Sense jackcard will spread a layer of synthetic.
Natural tissue does not accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to make this model of mattress in a forward version (vacuum roll-pack).
He's almost 16, and he hasn't been tempted to do anything for a long time.
It's all energy to choose what he's going to earn for himself.
He's much more responsible than I was in his years or my husband, who had trouble with the law before the wedding.
Father cares for his young daughter.
And he likes to write Lermonts, "For foreign love."
Why did the girl cry at the exam before she failed?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't school.
Well, she's gonna have a tail.
So what?
He'll transfer.
Millions of students know that.

Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms” against the EU
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms”
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Applenski, expressed the view that President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as “arms” against the European Union and intended to return to such “operations” next year.
A statement by the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs was made in an interview with Australian Financial Review.
According to the Jablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily “resolved Lukashenko”, but he is“ actively seeking new ways”.
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As the site kp.ru had written, the European Union had previously enacted the fifth set of sanctions against Belarus.
It concerned 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, we have expressed our readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the Republic “unless the situation in the country improves”.
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a broad list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not Seok's hat": when a boy's jacket makes a joke
In 2021, lighthouse jackets dominated the world.
Perhaps the first person to claim his new fashionable decision was Daniel Craig.
As early as September, he appeared at the premier movie "It's Not Time to Die" in a black raspberry jacket and a traditional "Bondovian" grandmother.
Following his example, Prince William twice followed, who first presented a green jacket to the Earthshot Preize ceremony that was not appropriate to the Royal Dress Code, and then chose a more classic version for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messisi was the one who got the trend.
The football player came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in Dolce & Gabbana's jacket.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same clothes.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for male jackets in Russia.
According to service analysts at Ghazeta Ru, they began buying them 1.4 times more frequently.
The most popular are warm jackets with silhouettes and silhouettes, and the main colors are dark, run-off, bearded, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between three thousand and 6,000 roubles, but men prefer to buy exclusively jackets, which they choose less often.
Not only can you buy them from online reliefrs.
Budgetary options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the barchat luxum segment, almost all brands -- and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Sain Laurent -- are represented in this season.
The most desirable is the Guci model, which came out on one of the premier films "Doom Gucci", the ambasador brand Jared Leto.
By picking out expensive marks, you can be sure that the barracks are made of silk.
The special interlacing technology produces dense tissue with waxy outer texture and smooth internality.
More budgetary options are made of cotton or polio, but are therefore less useful.
The fashion expert, Lamoda Ilya Wahoškin, warns that in the case of a black jacket, the main thing is not his model or fason, but the appropriateness.
"Barchat requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are gathered for a party or a solemn event," explains Wahoškin.
Another important criterion that is allowed to be met is the status of its buyer in favour of its jacket.
"A boy in a bargeon jacket should first be a well-developed man with wealth," says the authors of Telegram Canal about the male fashion of "Brammel Man." - The barbed jacket owners tend to belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to side-events of light, where the Dress Code is always listed.
Ilya Wahoškin suggests combining a jacket from a barchat with similar fancy things: classic trousers with arrows, single-ton shirts, silk ties, lollipops with cats, hooks.
Too simple and everyday things are going to look inappropriate.
The fashion experts from "Brammel Man" are confident that it's not appropriate to have a private employee in the barbed jacket at the corporation, but if it's "the guide of those who run this event, it's "Yes," it's that thing on the subject."
If the employee is lower in rank and the goal is to move up in the complex hierarchy of the company or to beat out financial bonuses, it is better not to put on a bad jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate the phrase "not Seungke's hat," says Telegram's editors about male fashion.
Very mixed feelings of voice.
It's not natural, it's hard to pull.
And it's not associated at all with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But I wish with all my heart luck in my life.
The whole thing about money is that alternative energy is lobbying well, so it pays off.
Billions of investment.
Do they grieve?
No, the price of electricity went up.
The traditional energy was also not in the overlay - gas, oil, and coal was bought cheaper than they are now selling.
There's wild demand for fuel.
A penny drops.
Then who's in the flight?
As usual, a private buyer.

Hence, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who are “swept” by the energy crisis.

It's a good mess.
I didn't see any beautiful people on the pictures in the article.
Just the directs in the middle-statistical passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole train, they're not going to be able to do so, most likely.
But it's only because of the mental disorder and the ignorance of such "pretentious" people, but certainly not because of their appearance.

A slave who is not aware of his slavery and who cries out in silence, unconsciousness, and wanton slavery is simply a slave.

Immunologist stated that revaccination in four to five months would help to protect against the strain of the coroner ' s " omikron "
Revaccination within four or five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omikron".
This was a declaration made by immunologist Nicholas Kručkov, who called vaccination six months later, given the emergence of a new strain, "a very large period."
"It was normal for the former strains, but now it is best to do the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four months," said the expert, in parallel with the inoculation campaign, to engage in rescission.
Kručkov also noted that early revaccination provided a good tit of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person was given two vaccinations and a sandwich, or was illed and vaccinated, or was vaccinated and cured, he received `hydrid immunity', i.e. an antitel is many and neutral enough”, the expert clarified.
The Group of Seven warned Russia of “scale consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The Group of Seven (United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States) issued a statement following the meeting of heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that “military aggression” by Russia against Ukraine “will have enormous consequences and will be costly” in Moscow, but does not describe specific measures in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine”, the statement states.
The Ministers further call on Russia “to reduce escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations with regard to transparency in military activities”, as President Bayden of the United States said during the video call to President Putin of the Russian Federation on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normanda format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of Seven also state.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
The Russian Federation should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in response," they caution.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine ' s position of restraint.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," also stated in the statement.
Earlier this day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, stated that Russia would suffer “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
The meeting, she said, showed “the voice of the Group of Seven countries, which accounted for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have enormous consequences for Russia”.
Pfizer vaccinated 32 times less effective than omicron Stamp
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfier-BioNTech against omicron stampa coronaviar is 32 times lower than that of the rest of the disease.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong, transmitting the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
Vaccines were considered less effective on the basis of a study of anti-virus activity among citizens who had received two doses of COVID-19.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the Sarah-COV-2 baseline, but this ability was significantly reduced against omicrnity,” said Professor Malik Peyris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe current of the disease when it is infected with the coronavirus.
Previously, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the development of the coroner pandemic in view of its impact on omicron Stampa.
The authors concluded that omicron Stamp could cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and increase in mortality unless additional measures were taken.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine accused the FWG of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of the former chancellor of FDG Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition by Kiev of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times of December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany had installed a veto on the purchase by Ukraine of anti-ospera systems and rifles to attack the drones.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened his position regarding rifles by recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons under bilateral agreements with allies.
This includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
In the meantime, FT notes that the position of the new German Government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholtz, on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ambassador Andrey Melnick of Ukraine in Germany expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to supply arms to the Chancellor of Scholc.
According to him, the previous FWG leadership explained its refusal to provide arms at the risk of developing the military escalation of the conflict in Donbasa, despite Russia's “occurrence” of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same “illogical” position, confident diplomat Germany will maintain with the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Greensky stated that Kiev was awaiting assistance from Berlin in the equipment of the Navy.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany “will be Ukraine's technical partner”, the President added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chair of the Green Party, Robert Habek, visited the Republic to advocate the sale of defence weapons to Kiev.

G7 warned Russia of liability for invasion of Ukraine
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the G7 countries warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continued military aggression against Ukraine, as stated in the final declaration of the parties.
The meeting also noted that it condemned the strengthening of Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
“The Russian Federation should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs”, states a statement published on the British Government's website.
The Ministers of the G7 countries and the EU High Representative noted that “they are united in their condemnation of Russian armed violence and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine”.
The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Elizabeth Trass, at a press conference in Liverpool, warned of “great consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to give up aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted on TAS).
Earlier, at the Liverpool summit, Foreign Ministers G7 agreed that the crisis must return to the negotiating table because of the increase of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.
This was about negotiations in the “normal format”.
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke for the dialogue on Ukraine in the “Normanda format”.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Maria Zakharova, stated that, by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the countries of G7 had “resented in their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes”.

Discovered ways to return stolen money via the Internet
There are several ways to get the money stolen through the Internet and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were discovered by information security experts in consultation with the RBC.
For example, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when bank cards are entered into the hands of abusers, it is recommended that the principal funds be stored on a map or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Some savings can be set aside in a savings account and raised as necessary.
Experts also recommend a separate map for online purchases.
If money was stolen from stores that did not use 3D Secure defence technology, a return procedure could be initiated.
“In accordance with the rules established by payment systems for unauthorized transactions conducted without use of 3D Secure, the liability rests with the participant in the calculation chain that does not use the service”, the representative of Promscombank clarified.
The expert from the international payment provider, Ecompay, Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer had the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator has used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be challenged and returned.
It is noted that in some cases Internet cars themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent.
On 19 November, Ekaterina Mizulin, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Safety Internet League, reported that in 2021 alone 11,000 cases of fraud had been filed, ranging from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
She said that an effective solution in the current circumstances could be to create a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholtz arrived in Poland to discuss “Northern Flow 2” and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholtz, arrived in Warsaw to negotiate a crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops off the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline “Northern flow-2”.
Although Scholtz has expressed his desire to preserve good relations between Germany and Poland for years, the leaders of the two countries have clearly expressed their expectations for each other.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz Moravecki, stated that he would encourage Scholtz to oppose the “Northern Flow-2” by which Russian gas was expected to be delivered to Germany by way of Ukraine.
According to Moravsky, Russia can use gas pipelines against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland ' s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that he would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreements.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party, Law and Justice, violated EU law.
Poland had refused to pay a fine and its highest court had ruled that national legislation took precedence over EU regulations.
The new Government of Germany, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to halt the work of the “Northern Flow 2” in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told Congressers that they had reached an understanding with Germany of the stop of the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine and reported on Tuesday to a high-level official of the U.S. Congress.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholtz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated the border of Ukraine, and this position on Sunday was confirmed by the representatives of the Group of Seven.

The Ministry wants to give writers residences.
The future Russian Letters Support Fund will be handed over by the State to federal property inherited from the Union of Soviet Writers and the Literature Fund of the USSR.
It will establish written residences and report the “Parliamentary Gazette” in Mincifra, which will be the founder of the fund.

The money found in the church's plumbing wall will pay $20,000
A plumber who found money in a church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will pay a reward.
This is reported in a press release by the non-profit organization Crimea Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in the major evangelical church of Lakewood, where pastor Joel Ostin preachs, promising that godly Christians are awaiting riches and prosperity.
In November 2021, Justin Coleley, a plumber, repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags with cash and checks under his insulation.
He passed on the church’s discovery and, according to him, did not receive even gratitude from Ostina.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you've done and what you could have done," quotes KPRC-TV.
Apparently, the find is related to the theft that took place at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques kept in the church safe were then lost.
The money was insured, so the church did not lose.
Nevertheless, information on criminals was presented with a $250,000 reward.
Justin Kowley could not claim this amount, since the prize had expired.
Despite this, a nonprofit organization called Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at the time awarded five thousand dollars and later received another 20,000 dollars as a gift from the Church of Lakewood, decided to reward the integrity of the plumber.
He'll get $200,000.
It had previously been reported that the police had questioned pastor Joel Ostina about the money found in the Lakewood Church wall.

In Brazil, citizens were obliged to apply for vaccination passports upon entry
In Brazil, a judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF), Luis Robert Barros, had been obliged to demand the entry into the territory of the country.
This is what CNN Brasil reports.
Vaccines are exempt from the issuance of a vaccine certificate for those who have vaccinations.
Also on the list of exceptions are those who came from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for a New Year's, Pre-Criminal and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which involve an increase in the tupots”, Barrossa noted.
In the past, the Brazilian authorities had imposed five days ' quarantine on inviolable tourists.
Full protection scheme opened from COVID-19
A virologist, a doctor of medical science, a well-deserved professor of Russian science, Anatoly Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
He said that this could be achieved through injection and the use of a nasal vaccine.
Immunoglobulin A is produced in large quantities of internal use. This does not happen when a vaccine is introduced.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous shell, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside of the vaccine, we have the biggest immunoglobulins of G (antithel).
And if you inject both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's not yet a decision to double vaccination," the doctors said.
The chief prophylectologist of UrFO, Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of applying perusal vaccination in conjunction with injection was the ability to cease to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help to ensure that the protection of the organism was expected to be maximized.
David Melik Guseynov, Minister of Health of the Suburban Region, stated earlier that a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is what happens in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic has arrived earlier.

I stopped many of my masters from running after the dog, even though they were due to run, 200,000 were running away, taking their hand and taking it to the other side.
Eventually, the 200,000 chose the owner, not the dog that ran somewhere.
In Europe, mass protests against vaccine opponents continue
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators came to the streets.
They expressed their dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and plans by the authorities to make coca vaccination compulsory.
As of February of next year, inviolable people will have to pay a fine of Euro3,600.
Spaniards, resented by the health policy of the authorities, conducted a peace march in Madrid.
Some held posters with "It's a false pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, a stand-alone certificate is compulsory for access to bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, homes of the elderly and night entertainment facilities.
The introduction of sanitary passports by authorities in several regions of the country has been the subject of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus contamination.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand manifestans protested the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully but then grew into clashes with the security forces.
A group of demonstrators threw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials used water.

WHO has found “miccron” in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that a new strain of coroner's “omikron” had already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have disastrous consequences.
The rate of strain is reported in a WHO report.
As of 9 December, the organization has identified strains in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
It is true that it has been actively spreading since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of expansion of the new coronaviour version.
WHO experts are concerned that a new strain on preliminary data can pass through the rate of the “delta” strain; it is an Indian version of the coronaviour, which is now leading in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Ted Adhan Gebrevies, stated that Omicron Stamp was able to have a significant impact on the progress of the coroner's pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also been reached in Britain.
The experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "Omikron" will replace "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone would be about 1 million, which is that there are currently several hundred people in the Kingdom who are officially infected, and estimates of up to 10,000 people.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the strain of “omikron” and carry more than 2,000 people daily to hospitals at peaks.
What the British health system can't handle.
The situation is complicated by the 32 times lower than the rest of the disease, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfiere-BioNTech vaccine against the strain of “omikron”.
The response to the Russian “Sputnik V” by the time it's not known will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaliel Center has just started testing a Russian vaccine at the "omikron" strain.

Russia warned of a new scheme of frauds
They started looking for new tools for video fraud.
This is referred to as “Investia” with reference to experts.
According to the Director of Products of Ivideon Zaura Abutalimov, dipphysics are the main danger associated with the distribution of video communications.
In such a case, fair video is produced by fraudrs on the basis of real records involving the victim.
As a result, neuroses can accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person’s behavior.
Abutalimov added that using a dipphyk, abusers can call friends by video link or create a video video video clip with a copy of a person for blackmailing.
"Such frauds can easily trigger a bullion, as a man of fraud can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudoscenaries," said the expert.
The leading systems engineer, Varonys Alexander Wetcol, in turn, noted that psychological people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video technologies.

Five actions are listed to help prevent diabetes
Blood sugar problems are one of the most common problems in the world.
Some, however, attach little or no importance to this.
In time, diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive action plays a major role in disease prevention.
For example, doctors recommend a change in the drinking regime - a reduction in various drinks and the introduction of conventional water has a positive effect on metabolicism.
Sweet foods increase blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when used in excess quantities.
So the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The emergence of the disease is affected not only by bad nutrition but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, we need a lot of movement.
Experts recommend a low - carbon diet.
Such a diet will not only reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
In order to protect against diabetes, many cells must be eaten.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to a sense of density, food juices, and increased digestion.

Dr. Paul's story was about the "day off" of the laborers.
Several factors may lead to a deterioration in self-esteem during the weekend
The cause of the deterioration of self-responsibility after work is often “a day-to-day migration”, explained a prominent medical doctor, a medical candidate, a senior scientist at the Faculty of Basic Medicine of IYM, a research director at the System Health Hospital of Zuhr Paul in her telegram.
She said that it was particularly common for work - related mothers to suffer from the headaches, breakdown, and weakness of the weekend.
Dr. Paula noted that apart from a week’s fatigue, there are many objective reasons for the body’s negative response to changing conditions.
On the weekend, our lives are changing dramatically.
"In the meantime, we lay on the couch all day, probably eating more, and drinking less, the doctor argued.
Because of overeating and lack of water, gravity and corruption.
Late recovery plays an additional role.
So if you stand three hours later than usual, there's a reaction called the Jetlag.
It comes from travelers who cross several time zones.
In order to determine which factor was crucial to the deterioration of self - feeling, Paul recommended that we observe that the most important factors changed on the weekend.

South African scientists have stated that the Pfizer vaccine against “microne” is not effective.
In South Africa, the Pfizer vaccine against “mikron” was poorly effective.
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa have conducted a study and reported that Pfier vaccine against omicron stampa coronavirus infection has been ineffective.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of the microne) corresponds to the effectiveness of the vaccine of 22.5 per cent against the infection with the symptoms, which ... questions the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, as stated in a study published on the MedRxiv portal.
However, experts have clarified that medication can save you from a severe flow of disease.
Previously, at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the omicron strain of coronary could cause a new wave of pandemics in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars do you have in your regular products?
Sahara is not the best source of nutrients.
Its surplus can lead to second-type diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should bear in mind that, under the unknown word, the product may indicate hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar by caloricity, composition and glycical index.
Several dozen names, in fact, representing sugar, can be presented on the label.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fruit.
There may also be other raw sugars, such as dextroza (e.g. maize sugar), leulosa (fract sugar), melassa (black stream), agava syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which refer to mono- and dysacarids, and they can be not only in air conditioning products, but also in ketchup, doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
In Russia, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as label and many different names of sugar.
The different types of sugar vary in taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product is called, syrup or nectar, processed or untreated, brown or white, it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary not only to take into account the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the package, but also that vegetables, fruit, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total quantity of sugar may be much higher than that shown in the label.
German chancellor Scholtz: gas will be of no importance to the FWG 25 years later
The new FIWG Chancellor Olaf Scholtz stated that gas imports were of no importance to Germany, as the country was continuing to decarb the economy.
He said that Germany planned to give up gas, oil and coal completely by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"That's 25 years from now, the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to the FWG and Europe will have a different role," said the chancellor.
Scholtz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is now important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement that recognized the support of Berlin for Ukraine ' s energy transformation.
The head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annan Berbock, stated earlier that the process of certification of the gas pipeline “Northern flux - 2” was ongoing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of coalition negotiations and the negotiation of a coalition treaty, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should apply to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline was still “not in accordance with” the European Union.

Hackers hacked into Twitter by the Prime Minister of India.
The hackers hackers hacked into the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.
The attackers were able to publish a feudal message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized bitcotin as a legal payment and that it had already purchased cryptography.
Mody's office was asked to ignore new messages.
The Prime Minister stated that Twitter was quick to respond - access to the bill was restored.
The country of the Prime Minister of India had already been broken down in 2020 and had been called upon to contribute to the fund by means of cryptography.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, concluded with the same result as the two preceding.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, most New Caledonians voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
The level of participation in this third ballot has, however, been significantly lower than in the previous two votes.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51 per cent (2,755) of New Caledonia's independence from France was voted against, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90 per cent, with the participation of more than 80,000 New Caledonians.
As France-Presse commented on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt”, as the independenceists called on the voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Archipelago prevented the conduct of a full and “honest” electoral campaign.
This failure thus opened the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, and 2020 53.3 per cent voted against independence.
The separatists stated that they did not recognize the results of the last ballot and would challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, 12 December, at the Elysian Palace, French President Emmanuel Makron is required to address the referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia ' s independence has greatly revitalized the recent weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates were in favour of remaining in France, as it was “the most recent region of the European Union presence in the Pacific Ocean”.
"The new Caledonia must necessarily remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated on several occasions.
The candidate for the Republicans, Valery Pecres, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, urged the Qualedonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it wasn't his responsibility."
Nevertheless, the President added, "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire that the choice of Kaledonics should be France's choice”.

In Turkey, the world’s first laser drone was tested
In Turkey, the first laser-weapon drone in the world was successfully tested.
The "Eren" BPLA protested between 100 and 500 metres, reports MIR24.
The equipment is able to neutralize explosive objects from a distance by means of a laser.
The maximum height of the new aircraft is 3,000 metres.
Following the relevant tests, BPLA should be equipped with Turkish military personnel who would use it to destroy explosive devices without the use of detonators.
The Agency stresses that Turkey is among the six countries in the world that are capable of developing and producing their own drones.

Readers of WSJ criticized an article on Russia’s relationship with the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article in which he described his vision of Russian and U.S. relations.
The author expressed concern about the alleged victim of Ukraine by the West.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger posed by Moscow and allowed a number of abusive remarks to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of the day, Hartwell called on Western countries “to stand united against Russia”.
The WSJ readers disagreed with the American professor's position.
“This article contains quite a lot of false information”, gives a comment by a reader by RIA Novosti.

The magnitude of the earthquake occurred near Chicotan, a Curyl Island.
It is noted that the earthquake epicenter was 231.8 kilometres north-east of North-Qurilsk.
It was 92.5 km deep.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of 7.5 magnitudes in Peru, which affected ten people.

Ukraine will begin to produce new generation ' s reactive drones
In a new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, an ANKA type of jet unmanned aircraft (BPLA) will be set up.
On 11 December, a freelance adviser to the head of the office of Ukrainian President Alexei Arestović reported on this.
So they can act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against aircraft manned.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and so forth,” quotes Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA machines, Arestovic explained that it was a reactive rather than a harmful BPLA.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceeds it "by all characteristics."
The first batch of BPLA is due to be produced by the plant at the end of next year, and Arestovic has been concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff, data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the military operations of the United Forces in Donbassa were classified.
On 6 December, President Vladimir Greenski of Ukraine reported that the construction of a modern military drone factory had begun.
According to him, Ukraine intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and Ukrainian Minoborans concluded an agreement to build a centre in Kiev to train staff as well as to test and service Turkish BPL Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the memorandum “a major real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport
The lions escaped at Changi Airport in Singapore.
This is what The Streets Times reports.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown which country they were brought from and to Singapore.
One of the lions ran off on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from him because of a set net of protective nets.
The opposition ended after the arrival at the airport of Mandai Wildlife Group, which is responsible for all Singapore zoos.
They have removed lions by wires with a tranquilizer and are planning to bring them to a quarantine facility.
Previously, it was reported that in Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s capital, a lion had fled from its owner and was walking through the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and the people did not suffer.
Experts warned of cancer threats due to vitamin B9
Studies have shown that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by Daily Express.
Experts believe that there is strong evidence that people with non-foliic acids are less likely to suffer from certain types of cancer, such as high blood pressure.
However, exceeding the necessary dose contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Dietologist Beth Kitchin recommends monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The cancer threat is increased only if the figure is substantially deviated from that number in a larger or smaller way.
Kitchin recommends against taking vitamin B9 in pills without a doctor's recommendation, and should watch for dosage and avoid cotton with milk and other foods containing phylic acid.
In the past, a nutrition consultant, Rachel Fain, called phyliic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is found in, among other things, the Avocado, Fain recommended that men, after 50 years of age, should be more likely to eat this fruit.
In Great Britain, about 75,000 people may die as a result of omicro-tampa by April.
Projections by British scientists indicate that the spread of omicron stampus in the next five months in England could kill up to 75,000 people without tightening restrictive measures in the winter.
This is reported in The Guardian, referring to a study by experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), transmitted by TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the British Cabinet ' s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergency Situations, at least 25,000 deaths will be recorded in the country by April 2022 due to the strain of omicron, and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
In addition, more than 2,000 people will be treated daily by hospitals at the peak of the disease.
“Several measures to combat the coronavirus may be necessary to avoid overburdening the National Health Service if the omicron Stamp is more contagious than the delta option and active vaccines cannot prevent infection”, said mathematician Rosen Barnard of LSHTM.
Previously, the British Health Security Agency informed that if the mic rate of micronic stamp continues at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, however, omicron strains could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, there are 1,898 cases of omicron stampia in Britain, of which 633 have been detected in recent days.
On 9 December, however, the head of British Minsdraw Sadjid Javid indicated that, in reality, this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superpowers has grown by a quarter in the world.
The construction of super-hospitals this year and the next year's orders are striking all the world's record despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of yachts ordered was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for floating strength for $50 million and above will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, they are increasing.
This year, 25 per cent more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say it wasn't 20 years old on the market.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear contamination on land and prefer to escape the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If all these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them are working far away and the talks are held in a field.
Broker Will Christy told the newspaper that shipyards accept orders for new yachts 2025 and later.
This means that employers are willing to pay more if their boat is ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he said.
In Western society, many criticize the behavior of the rich and call it Decadent.
The wealthy, say sociologists, do not want to understand that during periods of deprivation of space travel, yacht life, or flight on their own planes are a source of frustration in society because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with all the rest of mankind.
Economists call on Governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they realize that such mobility will make it very difficult for them to do so.
However, only the number of super-yats ordered is impressive, but their characteristics are also impressive.
Of 1,200 vessels, 27 are over 100 metres long.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekke builds a REV Ocean yacht with a length of 183 meters.

Helicopters, cinemas, and some of them, such as McGregor's yacht, have become common ground for helicopters, movies in the open sky, and some of them, such as McGregor's fighter's boat, are a platform for unity. Professor of Economic Anthropology of the American University of Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that little is done compared to the total number of greenhouse gas choices.
But it's symbolic, given that the world's multibillionaires are just over 2,000 people.
This is just another example of the overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the world’s average population.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, the world ' s largest pollutant, Roman Abramović, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that were released into the atmosphere in 2018.
In addition, two thirds of the emission trail was bent on its Eclipse yacht 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and command him to oppress the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Supersede owners do not feel sympathy for other people when they, like the richest Australian woman Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain through Utah that there is no place for their giant ships.
It is also difficult to understand her call for the construction of marinas for ships more than 50 metres.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified leading to the development of intestine cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of cancer.
This is what Daily Express writes about.
Experts have concluded that the use of four or more drinks per week is linked to an increased risk of oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in alcohol consumption.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of intestinal cancer than women.
The exact reason for this type of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, simply noting that certain factors are harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, and more precisely, all the dogs were convinced that these creatures were very smart.
But they don't even know how well four-footed pets really are.
Over the years, biologists have experimented in various ways to see for sure how animal intelligence is developed.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as a human, a new study proves that the dog can react consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists has been published in the Scientificalert.
Dogs can't play chess or create poems, they can't understand anything in politics, economics and art, but they can often fool their masters.
Some of the breeds are considered by experts to show better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for precise conclusions are not yet sufficient.
For example, some breeds have traditionally been considered dog geniuses, such as Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs can be logical and that their ability to learn does not result in a two - year - old.

In Ukraine, preparations were made for the U.S. and Russia’s sale
The US and Russia will “trade” with regard to Ukraine's entry into NATO, stated analyst Alexander Kochetkov in their article for the publication entitled “Glored”.
In his view, Washington and Moscow planned to continue negotiations soon on United States assurances that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Bayden on the right of “to enter anywhere”.
If you're offered something that you know is not acceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not going to trade, you're just going to send a offerer.
And there's going to be trade in Ukraine," an analyst wrote.
He added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine, but was seeking dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparations are carried out in secret, quickly and immediately to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the group to discover and deploy the forces of opposition”, he noted.
China stimulates the development of the railway industry
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the United States, France, Germany and other countries at the China International Rail Transport and Equipment Exhibition, 2021, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province/Central China.
The basic technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, as noted by How Zhao Zhaowen.
High-speed trains passing through the China-Laos railway line, which was introduced early this month, are already equipped with technology to ensure greater reliability and efficiency of the rolling stock.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased exports of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing a “Chinese speed”.
In May this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. came down the first two-deck high-speed electric trains developed in China to export to Europe.
At the maximum working speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will travel through the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the pilot operation of the subway train, developed by the company for Turkey, began.
The train will be driven by a Metropolitan link between Istanbul and the city airport.
This subway line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest subway line in Turkey at 120 kilometres per hour.
“The Chinese Railway Equipment Industry is one of the most innovative and highly innovative international competitiveness industries”, said Fan Yasosian, head of the Chinese Committee for International Trade Promotion, China Trade and Investment.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-quality equipment on the world market”, said Fan Yasosian.
After more than 60 years of intensive work, with a series of independent research and development, China has established a advanced system for the production of rail equipment, with a full range of supporting tools and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yaosyan, the country is the first in terms of the electrification of railways and the maintenance of high-speed and urban railways.
A biologist listed early signs of dementia
Simeon Goloshekin, a candidate for biological sciences, spoke with radio Sputnik and listed early signs of dementia.
He said that signs of future dementia might be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as incapacity to concentrate, plan, and lower abstract thinking.
A discussion is under way that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer ' s disease and a risk factor.
Goloshikin stressed that dementia could be caused by neurogenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and brain atherosclerosis are the most frequent causes of this syndrome.
A biologist noted that doctors today do not know effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, prevention must begin in time.
He said that learning foreign languages and active communication would help to reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends that moderate physical pressures be maintained, and that cognitive skills be regularly trained through games and hobbys that require intensive engagement with memory and thinking logic
“There are recommendations on the application of different BADs, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still being discussed in the scientific community”, said Goloshikin.
"The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of a moderate level of physical load, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbys requiring intensive engagement with memory and thinking logic," said Goloshikin.
Previously, a charity organization in Britain for the study of dementia stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 years or older.
Medical doctors called early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first warning sign can be seen as seeing problems that make it difficult for a patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is that experts have called aphasia a state where a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
A neuroscientist demanded Saakashvili to be sent abroad for treatment
The former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashili, needs psychosocial treatment and rehabilitation abroad, and has told journalists about the neuroscientist Otar Toidze, who is part of a medical council established under the Ombudsman of Georgia.
His neurologic status is at the heart of his illness.
Problems with movement, coordination, variability are persistent," said the expert, noting that this is not beyond the normative framework and that there is now a need for an ex-president to be sent to special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychosocial rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia”, said Toidze, demanding that Saakashily be treated in a special institution that Georgia does not have.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashivi began to sabotage medical treatment after disciplinary punishment had been imposed on him by prison officials.
Georgian policy was quickly able to abolish the punishment and restore itself to its former rights.

In Spain there were protests against COVID reporters
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, there have been protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, transmitted by the Europeanpa Press Agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID ports became compulsory for bar, restaurants, gymnasiums, homes of the elderly and night entertainment institutions.
Many of the manifestos came into action without masks.
The slogans on their poster accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for citizens ' choices.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment institutions and restaurants with more than 50 persons.
Protesters in that city announced a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the start of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million coronavirus infections have been detected, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
It is also planned to impose restrictions on non-vaccines in Russia.
The draft laws on a single QR Code system were introduced by the Government to the State Duma on 12 November.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit places of mass activity, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail trade with either a certificate of inoculation or immunisation or vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and aircraft.

A cool climb: how the Chinese become miningers
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, bringing together President Ci Jinping 1 trillion Yuan, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu Mining resort in Zhangjiakow, near the winter Olympics site, is becoming increasingly popular with Chinese people.
In addition to construction of infrastructure in the region, gardening work is also under way: workers plant trees.
There are over 700 mining resorts in the country, but only 20 are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjikow, there are snow problems.
The main challenge for the long term is to provide comfortable and interesting rest on Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become ever-present.
However, it is far from complete.
Game Adviser Justin Downs said that, since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry had changed to incomprehensible.
In wintertime, Chinese people flock to the slopes every year.
Fiona, Beijing snowboarder, one of them.
Despite major changes, it would take many years to create a mining culture here, Dawns believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and develop the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
The 70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Chongley, near the winter Olympics.
He notes that there has been a boom of winter sports tourism in recent years.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chunley, a rapid railway was built, and none of the local residents are now unemployed.
More and more shops are being opened to sell clothes and equipment for winter sports.
The slopes are covered with national kitchen dishes.
There's even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan now.
China seeks to create a prosperous winter sport industry, its athletes must become the leaders of the largest international competitions, and its resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may experience extreme poverty due to the pandemic, as stated in WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be turned into extreme poverty because of the coronaviour pandemic that has slowed human progress in the area of universal access to health care, as stated in the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage on 12 December, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic had caused health problems, caused undue stress in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
In WHO and WB, the pandemic has created “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
This situation drives more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their pockets”.
In October, UN Secretary-General Antônio Guterres stated that the coroner's pandemic had forced more than 100 million people into poverty and that more than four billion people had little social support.

Reuters: The Taiwan Minister was suspended from broadcast at the White House's “Sammit for Democracy”
The statement by Taiwan Audrey Tan, Minister of Digital Technology, during the United States-sponsored “Sammit for Democracy” was taken into effect without a video showing the recording of a YouTube summit.
Reuters, referring to the sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, there was a map on which Taiwan was identified separately from the PRC, which considered the island to be its territory.
The map, shown by Mrs. Tan, was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the world as civil rights.
Taiwan was identified green as free, while the DPRK, DPRK, Laos and Viet Nam were red as closed.
After the Minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot stating that the views of the discussants “do not necessarily express the position of the US Government”.
The PRC was not invited to "Sammit for Democracy".
Sources of Reuters note that the map shown by the Taiwan Minister may have been contrary to the one-China policy maintained by Washington.
One agency source stated that, following a map presentation, the U.S. National Security Council had angrily contacted the State Department, accusing him of showing Taiwan to a particular country.
The Washington-based “Sammit for Democracy” was held from 9 to 10 December with representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” summit, Nobel Peace Prize winner, Dmitri Muratov's editor-in-chief called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be used for charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary Sovbezi RF Yuri Averyanov stated that the summit was carrying “Antirosian and anti-Chinese charges”.

China strengthens the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in the cities where the land passes are located
A joint mechanism for the prevention and control of the PRC State Council issued a circular ordering the strengthening of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in the cities where the land points are located, with a view to further preventing the importation of infection from abroad.

Those who come to the cities where the land passes are located must, upon arrival, pass at least one test for nucleinic acids COVID-19.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day when the respective provincial administrative units define and publish the zones of those cities until 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land passes that meet certain conditions may consider creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we talked about a “beautiful conclusion” between Russia and the United States.
Presidents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with the Izvetoms, assessed the prospects for the relationship between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
One-sided negative predictability is, and here is some prospect of improvement in relations that is totally unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long journey we have taken with both the current administration and Trump and Obama.
"It didn't start yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is that the U.S. is trying to impose on Russia a variety of approaches to questions.
The heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that they would not risk providing optimistic forecasts of prospects for better relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress had been made.
At the same time, Russia called on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hoped that the signals would be heard and that Americans would listen to the arguments of common sense.
Formerly, Russia's Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, in a meeting with United States Secretary Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
The virus warned against the risk of vaccination of the non-patient drug nasal drug COVID
The resulting COVID-19 vaccine could lead to allergies and require medical assistance, so the first points to inflammation were not to be organized at airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by TASS, a member of the research team of the U.S.A., bioananologies, microbiology and virology laboratory at the Novosibir State University of Sergei Netes.
Vaccines at airports and shopping centres are easier to organize, but I would only do so at the outset in medical facilities.
The fact is that there is a risk of allergic reaction to such a vaccine, but it is not possible for a person to sit next to a doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-llergy drugs that operate in literally a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netes.
According to a virus specialist, it would be possible to think of vaccination in shopping centres when experience in the use of the drug was gained.
He also stressed that it was important to see a nasal vaccine in the nose if it was used.
However, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the nose inflated is shrunken after injection.

Serbia produced 2 million doses of satellite V vaccine
Satellite V vaccin is the most popular in Serbia.
Serbia produced about 2 million doses of Russian Sputnik V vaccine, as reported by TASS Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of Nead Popović.
"The State Institute of Torlac has still produced about 2 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine, expected to produce at least 4 million of them in the coming period," observed Popović.
According to him, the Russian vaccine is the most popular among Serbs.
The Republic is therefore planning to purchase a million additional doses of vaccine in Russia.

In Great Britain, 1,239 cases of omicron-tampa coronaviar-RT in Russian were recorded during the day.
Over the course of the day, 1,239 infections were detected in Britain by the new omicron stamp of the coronary.
Sky News informs us of this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases were reported in England, 38 in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of cases of COVID-19 from the new strain in Britain reached 3,137.
Previously, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimated that 75,000 people could die in England by April as a result of the outbreak of the coroner caused by the strain of “omikron”.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries imposing anti-Russia sanctions
The Spokesperson of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Peskov, commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including the alleged “invasion” into the country.
“It is impossible to impose restrictions on Russia and not to suffer on itself”, spoke the official representative of the Kremlin on the television channel “Russia”.
Peskov says it's "understanding everything in the world."
It was previously reported that the United States was considering the imposition of anti-Russia sanctions on energy as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to impose restrictions aimed at complicating the conversion of roubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
The head of Sberbank, Herman Griff, is convinced that this is impossible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of the participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on 12 December by the French BFM.TV.
96.5 per cent of those who voted were opposed to independence.
Maintained independence from France 3.51 per cent of the population of the Archipelago in the South Pacific.
The results were cancelled by 2.99% of ballots.
The voting rate was very low: about 55 per cent of the people of the Archipelago were present.
In the opinion of the experts, the low appearance was attributable to the separatists ' calls to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronaviour.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians expressed their opposition to independence from France.
A referendum on independence had already been held in the region in 2018.
Most of the inhabitants supported the discovery of the Archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its own possession.
Some 270,000 people live in the Archipelago and have special administrative and territorial status.
The 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian Administration provides that the region may organize a two-yearly vote on its independence.

WHO tentatively considers “omikron” to be less dangerous than “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has a preliminary view that “Omikron” is less dangerous than the Delta Stamp of the Crown.
However, there is a reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines in the new version of COVID-19.
According to information on 9 December, the “omicron” is registered in 63 countries.
“Provisional data and a significantly modified anti-genic profile of the strain protein `omikron' suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transmission of the option.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it (“the severity of the disease” - red) may be less severe than in the case of “delte”, says a WHO technical communication.
The organization notes that for the time being, all registered cases of “imicron” contamination in the EU are easily or unsymptopic.
However, the new strain is tentatively known to spread “delta” more quickly.
In Russia, two cases of Omicron Stamp infection have been reported.
They had been “immunized” before, reporting to the Gamaliel Center.
The head of Rosnevizar, Anna Popova, stated that there was no reliable evidence yet that the new version of the coroner was less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for the Greens scenario were named
Ex-Repute of the Supreme Council, Vadim Denisenko, listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine, Vladimir of Greenske, in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State could remain without the support of the West, as well as perhaps compromises on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko reported on the publication "Glored."
The first option, which Denisenko called “the perfect storm”, implies that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreement on the future of the country without its involvement.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis Kiev may face in 2023.
“The price of key goods that we traditionally export has been reduced by domestic protests and opposition to power with key FIGs (financial and industrial groups. — ED.)”, added the ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the situation: “war against all”.
This will be the case in the event of a high level of concern in world politics, in which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
Because of this state of affairs, the Ukrainian leadership may compromise on Donbassa, which may result in internal confrontation.
At the end of summer, the position of the Green Sea will be weakened, with the probability of such a situation, according to the former Nardep, up to 50 to 55 per cent.
The third option for the development of Ukrainian policy is to confront the dissenting population groups and the President, leading to the seizure of the power bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
During this version of the crisis, Greenski will begin “reforming power”, Denisenko added.
Another scenario is to turn Green into a nation's father.
This may lead to some event that will be a major shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to trigger reactions from external partners and increase Ukraine's support,” said Denisenko.
This option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made catastrophe or an aggressive act by Russia, and is considered to be an ex-deputate.
The Russian side has, however, repeatedly rejected any possibility of “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that have increased military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, data from a survey of the social group Reating showed that the Ukrainian president's rating had dropped to a record 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since his head of State was elected.
The analysts predicted a situation in which, in the case of the forthcoming election of the President of Ukraine for the Greens, only 21.8 per cent would vote, while 14.5 per cent for the ex-President of the country of Peter Porosenco.
However, only 19.3 per cent of those interviewed expressed support for the President.

Arrested on Red Square by a poet: "In Eutushenko's quote, they give 10 days, here she is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A WWE student was arrested in Red Square with a poster on which a hashtag #a poet with a big man's name was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Evgenia Eutushenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the re-incident of the conduct of a public action was drawn up on Alexandra.
He was first arrested on 23 January at the Puskin Square, at a meeting in support of Alexei Navny.
"The aim was to draw attention to poetry in general, now it's unfortunately lost interest in the collapse of a culture common in Russia, and also a small hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems under this hashtag on the Internet," Alexander explains.
We contacted a young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to reveal his messages in greater detail.
How have you been treated by police officers this time and before?
What were they asking in the department how they commented on your action?
This time, staff members were more correct, with maximum, polite detention, however ridiculous it might sound in some context.
The Pushkins were taken by the OMNOVites and taken hard.
They asked standard, motivations.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if they didn't, they understood.
With the exception of all four sides of the monkey sold, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was going on.
And if after this hashtag attack starts writing its poems, at least a few people, I'm going to take this 10 days off.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak in at least a Tumba-jumba language alone.
At public and official events, people speak the language of the people so that everyone can understand what happened in Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in their mother tongue through an interpreter.
This protocol, and nothing more, by the way, Angel Merkel speaks well of Russian and nonetheless uses the help of an interpreter.
Also at official events, there is a transcript on the author ' s old-age, and a stenographer is not required to speak several languages.

Researchers described how potatoes help in combating age violations
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients, which contribute to improved blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The roots contain vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, fishoflavin, folimic acid and pantoneic acid.
All these elements help to operate the systems of the organism.
Potatoes also help in combating age violations.
Because of its large content, it is useful for the stomach tract, and with regular use it can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
For the most good, however, the root may be better off drying or cooking than roasting on oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous to diabetes, as did other high-glymic products.
These are carbon-containing products that are rapidly clustered into sugars, such as sugar, sweet, nonalcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Comersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in production in private holdings and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the current product deficit would be able to replace imports only.

For example, the Lostfilm, which is available for both Yandex and Google's search, can be seen in the pirate copies of the Netflix Game in Calmary and Flexibility series by director Anna Melikian, Russia's largest video service ivi.
Kenogo, who is also available for the production of search engines, can look at Encanto's animation, but from the quality of the video, it's a so-called screen (a pirate copy of the movie in the theater).
Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, has a series called "University 10 Years Later" by a TV channel called "Gazprom Media".
Svetlana M., I'm sorry, of course, but I'd have to don't care if my son was being abused by his mother or not.

"This Polish idea" -- it would have been more true that Poland had only transformed itself into a 1776 idea, but had developed it quite efficiently.
In fact, the slogan "Crazine isn't Russia" appeared in 1848.

I watched her interview, and the girl said she had the greatest dream to grow up with wings, and Dad would keep putting her up.
Well, as if all of this was very questionable.
So you went to school, what's next?
A wall lamp, Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
The wide circle of the "molecules" of light provides as much uniform and bright as possible coverage of space.
"Atomic" or "molecular" design that reflects the nature and natural nature of each object, does not lose its relevance and allows for the beneficial placement of emphasis in the interior.
One of the characteristics of such lamps is the insatiability of design.
The thin, almost invisible cables, which are adjusted in height, make it feel as if the mirror is in the air.
Metal gold fittings and mammoth and white miniphons will be easily supplemented by any palliter, and the members of the collection will be ready for an assembly to light the living room, the bedrooms to which they are present.

Very good were the juices of high glass cylinders.
Three servings of the serum is too much for me to taste.

Mattras Dimax Micro Ultimaite, 160x190
Orthopaedic spring mattress Micro Ulmitt.
The model is comfortable because it has two different mild surfaces — high hardness and slightly higher than the average.
The product includes only quality and pre-dominant filling substances, which have proven to be exclusively of the best quality.
Dinners: An independent spring block is installed in the centre of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the bedroom, which are completely autonomous.
It is their function that provides a unique point adjustment.
“Mippaket” is the highest in all of the spring blocks “Dimax” and therefore has a vivid orthopaedic effect and is considered to be dominant.
Fillers: a combination of carpet layers and natural latex is installed from above and below the spring.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has a latex, the other has a coconut carpet.
It's been a long time since it's been classic because it's not only giving the mattress orthopaedic but also anatomical properties.
If the carpet provides correct back support, the latex allows the surface to be adapted under the human body.
Chahol: The model is supplied in the simple, tricottial Czech Aloe Vera.
If the customer wishes, it can be made either volume or fixed.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, and the recommended load for the bedroom is 170 kg.
Guarantee and security: the guarantee period is 3 years.
Matras received all necessary certificates and documents, which confirm his full safety and security in operation.
The orthopaedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian Scientists Will Seek Life in Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to find signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday “Acquatic Chamber”.
The purpose of five-year missions is to assess the appropriateness of the clouds of Venus and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartou scientists have proposed tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
The clouds of Venus, the closest to Earth, were still thought to be too acidic for life to exist there, but perhaps Venus was a planet of an earthly type.
During the third mission, a trial must come from Venus.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question is whether it is similar or different.
If so, it will be evident that earthly life did not begin on earth.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said Venus Life Finder, head of the Estonian team of the project “Venus Life Finder” Michael Pausal.

The Metallurgical will change Russian business
The theme of the meta-populated became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction among people.
And so the business in Russia, as around the world, will invest in building its own metabolic people and their subsequent monetaryization.
The metadata are worth considering as a continuation of the objective trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to create remote interactions in a pandemic environment is tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the business ' s desire to develop ecosystems and adapt to them operational models.
From the third, they are a logical continuation of the trend towards digitization of assets when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are digitized.

British economist failed to predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict for 2022 because he felt that such attempts would fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndication.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and that any trend may change circulation.
One of the most important factors is the coronaviour pandemic, and the second is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the price increases for goods were temporary or not.
According to the expert, it was clear before the pandemic that “the world of endless generosity of central banks had already survived” and that it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates on the basis of inflation would be adjusted to the expected growth rate of GDP.
O'Neill noted that, against the background of the pandemic, the continuation of super-flexible economic policies could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
Attention should also be drawn to the issue of productivity growth, as well as to poverty and climate change, summarized O'Neill.
Formerly, Michael Schulgin, Head of Global Studies, Discovering Investment, reported that positive expectations at the dollar rate for 2022 remained, with growth potential lower.
Among the risks for the dollar was Schulgin’s monetary policy, oil price dynamics and fears against the coroner’s pandemic.
I have to agree.

Russia has given car dealers about 4.5 per cent of the country's GDP
As a result of the 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion roubles on new vehicles, an increase of 28 per cent over the previous year's similar period, as shown by the Agency's statistics on Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the State on supporting citizens and economies during the coronaviour pandemic.
In the past September, President Vladimir Putin, at the meeting of heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, said that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Russian market earns a Korean brand of Kia.
In 10 months of this year, it managed to carry out 325.7 billion roubles, an increase of almost 24 per cent over the previous year.
The Hyundai brand is even larger at more rates than 35 per cent, while the car sales proceeds are estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In leading positions, this brand has increased by almost 21 per cent in the year of Hyundai, to 1.94 million roubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz have been able to travel more rapidly.
However, sales from Korean brands did not grow as much: according to the statistics of the Association of European Business Auto-producers in Russia, Kia had achieved 9.4 per cent more cars during the same period than one year earlier.
Hyundai, almost 12%.
The three cash sales leaders of Japan, Toy250, spent 275.5 billion roubles on their cars for 10 months, an increase of 14 per cent over the previous year.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion roubles (+75 per cent) - the German premium-brand has grown and sales volume (37 per cent) and the average weighted car price (almost 28 per cent, up to 8.2 million roubles).
"Mercedes-Benz has also seen a good increase in sales and a medium weighted price -- more than BMW -- hence and a greater increase in financial capacity," explained NaPI CEO Tatian Arabajji.
By the rate of increase in sales, fantastic indicators show Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased the financial capacity this year.”
Russian Lada shows averages (plus 28 per cent) on income growth and spent 229.4 billion roubles on Russian cars in 10 months.
At last year's financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales fell in things in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
The Russians spent 12 billion roubles on their off-roads and pick-ups in 10 months, as opposed to 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of motor vehicles and production disruptions covering the world's automobiles, the car company continues to continuously adjust prices - the same AITVAS increased the cost of the Lada models seven times a year, the last trip (on 8,000 roubles) at the end of November.
Prices are regularly copied for their products and other car manufacturers.
The size of the Russian road market will continue to increase in monetary terms, apart from the shortage of machinery, inflation makes its contribution, as well as the desire of the autoconcers to lose past losses, experts believe.
In the face of a shortage of cars, I think many car terminals have even been able to partly shift to consumers the costs of past periods that they had not been able to put into the price of vehicles before,
Says "VTB Capital" analyst on Vladimir Bessalov's car track.
I believe that, financially, car manufacturers are feeling very good right now, supporting the high cost of selling."
Indirectly, this is the rate of increase in the cost of cars observed during 2021, the price of new machines increases faster than inflation, as the expert explains.
In the long term, the market will increase in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly through inflation and the complexity of the machinery itself, predicts Bespalov.
As the supply increases, there will be limited opportunities for price increases.
In monetary terms, the Russian author will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the cost of vehicles slows down, the car manufacturers will be able to earn their income at the expense of the volumes, notes the independent consultant on the Sergey Bourghazli vehicle industry.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now seeking the greatest profit from each car sold, notes Borgazlis.
Increases in vehicle production are not expected in the next six months, and Russian traffic is also heated by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the backdrop of the market situation, cars have proved to be a good source of investment -- a car purchased a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold more expensive, notes the expert.
Byden spoke of the transfer of US military to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending American soldiers to Ukraine in the event of Russia's “invasion. ”
President Joe Bayden of the United States made such a statement.
"Never has there been such a plan," said the head of the White House, answering the journalist's question as to whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Bayden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalated, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of the use of United States troops unilaterally for Ukraine ' s defence was not on the agenda.
Byden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States would withdraw forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovakia).
“We will have to send more United States and national troops to the eastern flank, and B9 to all NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia”, said Byden.
Earlier, Russian Spokesperson, Dmitri Peskov, emphasized that Moscow had no intention of entering Ukraine.
He indicated, however, that Moscow saw the problem of the military use of the boats supplied by Kiev, as well as the fact that “American arms are approaching our territory”.
