Oh, how long have these symptoms been present?
and all chest pains must be treated in this way, especially given your age.
and at high temperature
and the level of your cholesterol and arterial pressure is also required

The rapid increase in coronaviral infections (COVID-19) in the European Union and Great Britain from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The coultimatary incidence of coronaviral infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and in the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, despite different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has grown rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, there is a need to increase the availability of patients from COVID-19, who will require treatment and, in particular, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, Hubei Province of China reported several cases of pneumonia from unknown ethics.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the new type of coronary virus known as type 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) was the cause of the infection.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronaviral infection (COVID-19).
According to available data, approximately 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 have a mild form of disease, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most patients are cured.
Approximately 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent take a critical form when intensive treatment is required.
The mortality rate for patients hospitalized from COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
This study analyses the cumulative trends in COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EE) country and in the United Kingdom and compares them with the trends in the Hubei Province of China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and Great Britain
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is now developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamics as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which met the criteria for WHO to determine the existence of the disease, in the issue of Eurosurveillance of 5 March 2020.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported in France on 24 January 2020, all three of which returned from Uhan Province of Hubei China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 was detected in all 30 EU/EE and British countries, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 fatal cases, accounted for only Italy.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the number of reported cases in each country worldwide from official sources, such as health ministries of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data are used to analyse and compare COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom with those in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence rate of active COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 was calculated to be cumulative in 14 days, taking into account the normal current of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom for the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We have also provided a cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at 8 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared to data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in Great Britain
Trends in the 14-day cumulative cognition of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK generally corresponded to trends in the Hubei Province of China (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to rise around 21 February, and a sharp leap (additional material) was made on 28 February 2020.
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and in Britain there were similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and Great Britain compared to the same for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as at 8 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom is comparable to that recorded in Italy only about three weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
The observed cumulative trends in COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This despite different stages in different countries, the differences in responses by national public health authorities and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases of illness and different rules for the selection of patients for COVID-19 analysis, including “precious” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of the patients from COVID-19 required intensive treatment, while the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already as full as possible.
To date, data on admission of patients from COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) intensive care units in the EU/EEA are only available for 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases respectively (not reported).
However, there is a need to systematically collect such data in order to supplement current surveillance data, which include the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a study carried out in 2010-2011, there is a large spread in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 risk assessment presents scenarios for modelling the utilization of health system resources with estimates of hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, where the risk of lack of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
Since cases are currently grouped according to certain EU/EEA and British regions and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, information on cases of infection and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to provide, where possible, level 2 units of territorial units for statistical purposes (UTS-2).
Italy ' s experience and current trends in other countries show that the EU/EEA and Great Britain pandemic COVID-19 is rapidly developing.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for the long-term SARS-CoV-2 contact scenario and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical treatment and, in particular, intensive treatment, as can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the last report of the ECDC on the results of the rapid risk assessment, the rapid, proactive and integrated approach to controlling the spread of ATS-COV-2 is essential, with the subsequent transition from deterrence to mitigation, as, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have sufficient time to reflect, adopt and adjust their response if such measures are not taken in advance.
The report on the results of the rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can increase their monitoring efforts in order to slow the spread of ATS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks the health system in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive treatment.
The outbreak of coronaviral infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-COV-2), has become a tragedy for humanity: to date, more than 3,000 people have died in China and other parts of the world, and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the SARS-CoV homologous virus, which led to the development of a severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, ATS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less serious and has lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people than young people, and men are more likely than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on new diseases, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject of the study.
We will consider basic aspects of epidemiology, ethics, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate a dangerous disease.
The spring celebration (New Year of China), which fell on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and memorable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and many weeks after the outbreak of the new virus infection.
In view of the high degree of similarity with the coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the SARS-CoV-2 virus on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease coronaviral infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and spread rapidly throughout the country, followed by nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been identified, more than 40,000 patients had been cured and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a “enemy number one for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 COVID-19 publications, including articles on its virus, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis and treatment, have been published in less than two months, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
The review is an attempt to compile research results into a new and rapidly developing subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronaviral disease, the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss what is known to date about the prevention and forecasting of the current of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Cornivorouss have traditionally been pathogens that are not deadly to humans and that mostly cause about 15 per cent of general respiratory diseases.
However, in this century, we have twice faced high-pathic human coronaviruses, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak of disease initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and shortly thereafter, spread to many other States with an alarming level of disease and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third outbreak of coronaviral infection in the history of mankind.
As shown in figure 1.1, the first reported cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Uhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case in Uhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it became known that health workers had been infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted from human beings.
On 23 January, Quarantine was introduced into Uhan, and urban public transport was discontinued.
On 24 January, according to a first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronaviral infections had direct contact with the Uhan Seafood Market, which was considered to be the starting point of the infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the coronary outbreak was a global public health emergency.
By the time the report was prepared, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to some 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final extent and risk of outbreaks have yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
ATS-CoV-2 was infected by all age groups, but mostly by people between 30 and 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
Infection of ATS-CoV-2 among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/1000,000).
COVID-19 was distributed mainly by clusters in the province of Hubei and in nearby regions.
On average, there were 5 (2-9) days from the time COVID-19 symptoms were detected to the diagnosis.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
An average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days have elapsed since the symptoms came to light.
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 - 4.05) and the corrected R0 was 2.23 - 4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of people infected, which coincided with large-scale transport prior to the celebration of the New Year of China.
The death rate for confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10 - 1.86%) and the corrected death rate for patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02 - 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were: sex (male), age (-60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Cornivores are sub-familys of large shell viruses containing one thread of meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and betaconic viruses are known to strike people.
In the event of damage by SARS and MERS, glycoprotein of shell-shaped scab (S) shall be connected to cell receptors of type 2 angiotensin-turning enzyme (ACE2) and diptideylpypaptase-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
The citoplasm is released by the viral RNA genome; after the viral genome is reproduced, the genome RNA, together with the nuclecoproteins and nucleocpside proteins, produces viion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the cell membrane and release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence reports were received on 10 January 2020.
The SAS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of betakoronnivore, with a 99.98% genome that matches the 10 consecutive samples collected at the first outbreak point in the Huang Sea Products Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, ATS-CoV-2 is closer to SAS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-tone cuts of the human respiratory episcopal.
It has been established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for ATS-CoV-2 as well as for SAS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of SAS-CoV-2 is less connected to the enzyme of ACE2 than is the case for SAS-CoV, which explains the fact that ATS-COV-2 is less serious for patients than SAS-COV.
SAS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein coded orf3b and a secret protein coded orf8.
Orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can play some role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress IFN; however, orf8 contains no known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) presented reports on the cryoelectronic structure of the ACE2 full-scale enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 . . in conjunction with the Amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed data, was collected as a chimney and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S-proteins, which is proof of recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in a drug screening to suppress the infection of ATS-CoV-2.
Origin and Intermediate Owner
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have been the flying mice from which the virus was transmitted to man via cyvet and camels, respectively.
By means of a phylotechnic comparison of ATS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first owners of the SAS-CoV-2 were bats, since the new virus was 96% identical to two SAS coronaviruses, namely, the corona virus of the SL-CoVZX45 and SL-COVZX21.
However, it remains to be seen what kind of intermediate host has become, which has helped the virus overcome the species barrier and infect the human being; the path of transmission is also yet to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that snakes had become vectors of the virus from bats to humans and that the homologic recombination in the S-protein had taken place.
As a result of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that the pangolins — long-term mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are potential intermediate masters of the SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the coronavirus of the pangons and the SAS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1%, distributed between the two genomes, is still very large, so it is considered that final results with specific evidence are not yet available (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SAS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in the dry environment and for up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and 40 to 50 per cent humidity.
SAS-CoV-2 can have similar properties.
It is known that ATS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heating for up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; it can effectively block the activity of the virus, 75 per cent lead alcohol, chlor-containing disinfectants, peroxylic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexide.
The human population as a whole has no immunity to the ATS-CoV-2, so people are vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, there are no detailed studies of the Immune Reaction at SAS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, particularly ATS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Normally, the virus in the body recognizes the inborn immune system first by means of image recognized receptors (RRs), including receptors for C-type lectin, Toll-like receptors, NOD receptors and RIG-I receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus causes inflammation of inflammation, dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which contain the spread of the virus and accelerate phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the SARS-CoV N protein, it is possible to avoid immune reactions.
Soon an adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ T cells and CD8+, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-affected cells.
helper T cells produce incendiary cytokines to help protect the cells.
However, the coronavirus may inflame T-cell functions, causing their programmed death.
Moral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against virus infection.
For example, the antibodies released from a recovering patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperactivity of the immune system results in the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst scenario, lead to polyorganic deficiency and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by clustering, is more likely to affect older persons with accompanying pathologies and pregnant women.
The risk of infection is higher for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune system disorders.
According to the results of the first 425 cases of infection in Uhan, the estimated average incubation period is between 1 and 14 days, mainly 3 and 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period averaged 3 days, with a range of 0 to 24 days.
More recently, the study described above, based on the demographic data of 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 - 7.2) days.
It is important for the health authorities to adjust the time frame of the quarantine measures introduced to the most accurate calculation of the length of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with unsymptomy.
The general practice is 14-day quarantine for persons with contact with the virus or infected with the virus.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and primary symptom of COVID-19 is often the high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficult breathing, muscle pain, headache, headache, throat, narcissus, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
A week after the onset of the disease, some patients were exposed to breathing and (or) hypopsy.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopatia.
Patients with high temperatures and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for early diagnosis, even if there are no breast cancers.
A demographic study carried out at the end of December 2019 revealed the following prevalence rates: 98 per cent high temperature, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent papaya, and 3 per cent diarrhoeal; 8 per cent of patients required artificial ventilation of the lungs.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of cases of infection in the family and transmission of the virus from unsymptomized infections.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 from a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high temperatures (98%), dry cough (47%) and respiration (55%).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial ventilation of the lungs, which was much higher than for patients with COVID-19 and corresponds to a higher proportion of mortality from MERS than for COVID-19.
MERS also had diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of MSS patients are high temperatures (99 - 100 per cent), dry cough (29 - 75 per cent), plumbing (40 - 42 per cent), diarrhea (20 - 25 per cent) and throat pain (13 - 25 per cent), while artificial ventilation of the lungs is required between 14 and 20 per cent of patients.
As at 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide was 66,576.
In comparison, the mortality rate from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study showed that the base value of reproduction (R0) for ATS-COV-2 was 6.47 at 95% of the confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for ATS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
The comparison of ATS-CoV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is shown in table 1.1.
The above indicators show a higher number of ATS-CoV-2 distribution capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for new virus infection is lower than for the last two.
Thus, it will be much harder to contain the ATS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV epidemics.
A classic phenomenon often occurs when infected within a single family or group of people who have come together for any reason or who have come together on any transport, such as a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Uhan or other affected regions, lived there, or had contact with the infected or sick during the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
According to the reports, however, people may be carrying the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have been treated may be released from the hospital again as carrying the virus, a warning signal for the extension of quarantine.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 have developed leukocytes < 4x109/L, including white blood cells < 1x109/L, as well as elevated asparagus-aminotransferase and virus levels.
Some patients have found elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in their blood, and most patients have increased levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes in their blood.
The level of D-D-D-D-D-D-Pybrin in the blood has been increased, and the number of lymphocytes has decreased steadily.
Most patients with COVID-19 found pathologies with uneven eclipses on both sides or eclipses in the type of "matl glass" in the lungs during their chest X-ray study.
Patients often develop austere pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (ARD).
Uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis result in significant gas exchange disruptions.
The dysfunction of type I and II pneumatic cells reduces the level of surface active compounds and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray research are often the same as the worst cases.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the removal of pneumocells, the formation of gylylene membranes and inter-cellular lymphocytic infiltration, while the multi-nuclear synitial cells in the lung patients who died of the disease corresponded to the pathology of virus infection and ODS and were similar to those found in patients with ATS and MERS.
The primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the method of detection of the SAS-CoV-2 RNA through a polymerose chain reaction with a reverse transcrypsis (RPC with a reverse transceptase).
However, given the high level of false effects that can accelerate the epidemic, since 13 February 2020 China has begun to make a diagnosis on the basis of clinical evidence (no longer relying solely on PCRs with reverse transcrypsis).
A similar situation was the diagnosis of ATS.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine data on the history of the disease, clinical evidence, laboratory tests and X-ray research.
On 14 February 2020, Mr. Feng Zhang, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang, described the protocol for the application of the SHERLOCK methodology, based on the CRISPR repeat method, to detect ATS-COV-2; this method identifies synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 at a density of 20 x 10-18 mol/l up to 200 x 10-18 mol/l (10 - 100 copies per microlitre of the baseline) using indicator strips of less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new methodology, if tested successfully on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of the tests.
Due to the lack of experience in countering the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can generally provide patients with COVID-19 only treatment while at the same time attempting to apply any therapeutic methods that have been or have been suggested for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as ATS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-virus drugs, suppressors of immunity, steroids, plasma of recovering patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of healthy patients was suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
In the early stages, ATS-CoV-2 is mainly attacked by light organs and may be less likely to attack other ACE2 expressive organs, such as the stomach tract and kidneys.
Nevertheless, job disruption and the refusal of breathing organs are the main threat and cause of death for patients.
Thus, support for the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, are critical to the relief of symptoms and life.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extra-corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified method of extrapolated blood flow, which is used to treat life threatening heart or respiratory deficiency.
In addition, the maintenance of the water-salt balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital functions are essential for patients from SAS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is a consequence of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with the ATS and MERS viruses.
The cytokine storm is a system-wide inflammatory process developed in response to the release of a series of cytokins, including TNF
These cytocins cause immunocells to release huge amounts of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of ODS and polyorganic deficiency.
In the treatment of a cytokine storm, particularly for patients in severe condition, the suppression of immunity is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilismubs, monoclone antibodies used as interlequine-6 inhibitor were used to treat cytocin storm.
Other treatments for cytokine storms based on the suppression of immunity include the modelling of immune responses aimed at controlling T-cells; the blockade on the production of INN-, IL-1 and TNF cytokines; the suppression of yinus-kinas; the application of blintomaba, cytokin-plate compressors 4 and hystondeacetalyza inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes, steroids are widely used as suppressors of immunity in the treatment of SAS viruses.
However, large dose steroids do not benefit from the treatment of serious lung injuries in patients with ATS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrrhosis, which significantly contribute to the forecast.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended for use with caution when treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective anti-virus therapy.
However, the intravenous introduction of a nucleotide nucleotide, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdessir is a recently developed anti-virus drug originally developed by Gilead to treat Ebola and Marburg virus-related diseases.
Later, the remedessir also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with single-chain RNAs, including MERS and SARS.
In the light of this data, Gilead provided this medical team to China to carry out pair studies on patients infected by ATS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, barcytinib, `interferon', Lopinaviar/ritonaviar and fisherin were proposed as possible treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavire/ritonaviar may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver loss and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other medications assigned to patients should be monitored with care.
Plasma of well-healthed patients and development of antibodies
Blood transfusions from patients who have been cured of an infectious disease have long been used to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect a healthy population.
Indeed, a relatively high number of antibodies are often held in the blood of the cured patients to combat the pathogen.
The antibody is in the immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign water objects; they recognize and target individual molecules of pathogens.
On the basis of this assumption, plasma was derived from blood samples from a group of patients who had been cured of COVID-19 and then introduced to 10 severely ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, their inflammation rate and viral load decreased, and blood saturation with oxygen improved.
However, to propose mass use of this method before a specific treatment is carried out, there is a need for untested and unexplained explanations.
Furthermore, given the therapeutic effects, some deficiencies in plasma use should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive immune system stimulation and cytokines release syndrome, which, given the toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and a lot of blood plasma is required to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to identify the B-cells of healthy patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or screen them to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
That way, we can move right away to mass production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of many components of a formula, the composition of which varies according to the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild and moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from severe conditions of illness.
For example, Xhu Feng Tse Doo (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Lian Hua Qing Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen) capsules were considered effective for COVID-19 treatment.
The largest percentage of patients who recovered from COVID-19 was in a number of provinces in China, where 87 per cent of those treated were Chinese traditional medicine, including in Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ninx (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hobei province, where only approximately 30 per cent of those treated with COVID-19 were treated, the lowest percentage (13 per cent).
However, this is quite a comparison, since evaluation must take into account many other factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively for Western medicine and combination treatment for Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time frame for normalizing body temperature, treating symptoms and providing hospital care was significantly lower for patients whose treatment was combined with Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who were treated only in Western medicine.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to suffer from a deterioration of symptoms (from mild to severe condition) was significantly lower in the group treated through a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only in Western medicine (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and security of Chinese traditional medicine still required more carefully controlled research on a larger scale and in a larger number of regions.
It is also of interest to receive, where possible, a description of the mechanism for action and an explanation of the effectiveness of components used in traditional Chinese medicine or their combination.
Patients suspected or confirmed by COVID-19 are mostly afraid of acute or even deadly illness, and those who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, hypopsy and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as sleeplessness from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of an outbreak caused by the ATS virus, a number of mental illnesses were reported, including chronic depression, high anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotive inflammation, psychotic symptoms, deliriums and even suicide behaviour.
Compulsory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, which are among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase the anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma to their families and friends.
Psychiatric and psychiatric assistance should therefore be provided to patients with COVID-19 and to persons suspected of or in contact with them, as well as to all other people who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health-care teams, the establishment of clear information on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronics and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission of infectious and infected people to vulnerable owners, and are often used to supplement the anti-virus treatment used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work was carried out on the development of S-protein vaccines aimed at developing long-lived and highly neutral antibodies and (or) protection immunity to ATS-CoV.
In animal studies, live, weakened sars viruses vaccines were developed.
However, before clinical studies begin, it is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when applied to older patients, the death-dose model and the degree of protection against zoon virus infection.
Perhaps the reason for the fact that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago has not been reported since.
At the same time, recurrent cases and MERS-related clusters of disease continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions, as a result of the conservation of zoo-based sources in the habitats of endemics.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed with the use of an animated virus, DNA plasma, virus vectors, nanoparticles, viral particles and recombinant protein components, and some of these strategies have been evaluated on animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against ATS-CoV-2 for those without immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to contain a raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties arising from the long period (an average of 18 months) required for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to display a full picture of clinical current at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high complications and high mortality rates among patients with severe illness.
It is therefore crucial for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease in order to prioritize their actions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on current clinical research data, the following factors may affect or be associated with a patient ' s prognosis with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the current of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who were in need of intensive treatment were more likely to have initial diseases and complications and were much older than those who did not need such treatment (on average 66 years, compared to 51 years), indicating that age was a predictive factor for patients from COVID-19.
Gender: SAS-CoV-2 infections among men are higher than among women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to develop acute damage to myocardium and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events have also been the leading cause of death in the SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be linked to ACE2 positive holangiocells, which could cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely interrelated and can distort results.
The variations identified in laboratory research: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of inflammatory process or tissue damage, and is proposed as a potential predictive factor of disease current, reaction to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that consideration should be given to the relationship between C-reactive protein level, the severity of the disease and the projection of COVID-19.
In addition, high levels of lactade hydrogenasis, aparagine aminotransferases, alanine aminotransferases and creitinases can also predict results.
These enzymes in large quantities are separated by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when the tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally a marker of the heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: To predict results and complications in COVID-19 treatment, together with other factors, the X-ray study of the chest and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunity suppressors commonly used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Because of the extensive use of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with severe forms of ATS, many patients have developed avascular osteonocrosis, which has resulted in life’s disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if it is necessary to use steroids to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: In the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unexpected severe stress because they often have to endure prolonged quarantine periods, cope with high uncertainty, and observe the deaths of relatives and other patients.
In order to relieve the stress of such patients and help them to return to normal life, psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided.
According to demographic studies carried out so far, the COVID-19 epidemic seems to differ from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tracts, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common cold diseases, can reproduce successfully in the upper respiratory tracts and cause weak symptoms or do not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet ended the incubation period may, in their normal lives, spread the virus on a large scale, making epidemiological control very difficult.
However, it was believed that the transmission of the SAS-CoV virus occurs when patients are seriously ill, although most of the cases did not occur at the early stage of infection.
Thus, today ' s COVID-19 epidemic is far more serious and more difficult to control.
There is a great deal of work currently under way in China in which universal quarantine has been declared in Uhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the extension of quarantine to virtually all the population in order to break the SAS-CoV-2 virus chain.
While these measures are very damaging to the economy and other areas of the country ' s life, the number of new patients identified is declining, indicating a slowing of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the phase of silence will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Gunter) and his colleagues had calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which appeared to be much more contagious than the SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) have developed a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and have suggested that the SAS-CoV-2 virus may affect two thirds of the world ' s population.
A team of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been detected in nose and throat brushes taken from patients who had been cured and discharged two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclic disease similar to the flu.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, pointing out that the current strategies may have had an impact.
The initial projection was that Ebola’s fever would strike up to a million people and kill half a million patients.
But strict quarantine and isolation eventually brought the disease under control.
It is likely that, like the SAS-CoV virus, the ininfection capacity of the SAS-CoV-2 virus can weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus living with a human being.
The following is a comparison between the COVID-19 epidemic and the ATS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SAS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through cough or sneeze, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been detected in potassium, which means that oral phycological transmission is also possible.
According to a recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 cases studied may have resulted from infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the population, particularly health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders, who are in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the person; and surgical masks and respirators of Class N95 (Series No. 1860s) help to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent micro-capal fluids from flying in the air and from settling on surfaces from which they can be passed on by others.
However, only Class N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of 10 to 80 nm in size, only 5% of the rions; the SAS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SAS-CoV and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can even penetrate five surgical masks together, medical personnel who are in direct contact with patients must wear class N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care workers should wear protective blankets to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor contracted ATS-CoV-2 even though he wore a class N95 mask; perhaps he was infected with the virus through his burning eyes.
Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type protective points.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more frequently with disinfecting detergents, to try to stay out of the house in self-insulated areas and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of about three feet is considered acceptable to the patient.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SAS-CoV-2 virus had not previously been known to humanity, its high level of similarity to the SAS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, was to be a warning signal to China, taking into account its experience during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020 did the director of the Uhan Center for Disease Control calm the citizens, stating that the new virus had a low level of biology and limited reproductiveity with human-to-human transmission and that preventing the spread and monitoring of the disease would not be a problem.
The statement significantly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing to celebrate the New Year of China, and the critical time was lost when the disease could be contained within the limits of Uhan, with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can learn this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as each word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information from clinics than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain the potential epidemic at the early stages of its development than to calm the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and to regularly test and improve public response.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unexplored corona virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease had spread throughout China and, at the time of writing, it had spread to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19 symptoms, similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of the SARS recidivism caused a sense of recidivism.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in terms of controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 is more likely to affect older persons than young people and men than women; the incidence of severe deaths and mortality among older persons is also higher than among young people.
The death rate due to ATS is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unsymptically running, while SAS patients usually only become infected in severe cases of disease, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why ATS-CoV-2 is spread much faster and larger than ATS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal samples for the availability of the ATS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, cured patients may again show positive samples of the virus.
All of this greatly increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
With this rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain to be resolved, namely:
What is the origin of the ATS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of 96% homologist between SAS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses of bats, we are still unable to claim that the infection of ATS-CoV-2 was caused by bats.
What animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from its original owner, such as bats, to man?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot effectively interrupt the transmission, and the epidemiological situation can worsen at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that ATS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how is it that the virus is introduced into airway cells and causing further pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically from human to human?
Will it cause a global pandemic, also disappear as SARS, or will it periodically be recuperated like a flu?
Those aspects were of paramount importance, but it would take time to find answers to those and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normalcy.
Zoonous origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have spurred coronaviruses (CoVs) and their carriers, including human beings, for millenniums.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronarians (HCOV) were causing a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life - threatening human coronavirus can be.
The appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome type two (SARS-COV-2) in central China in late 2019 once again drew attention to the coronaviruses and surprised us with a high degree of transmission, but with a less pronounced pathogenity of the virus than the related SAS-CoV virus.
A person's coronary infection is a zonozo, and an understanding of its zonal origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogenic.
There are also intermediate reservoirs carrying some human coronaviruses.
The definition of carrying animals has a direct impact on the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of coronavirus - carrying animals can also shed light on the pathogens of the coronary.
In this review, we provide available data on the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as on their zonal origin and inter-species transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, the present epidemic of coronavirus disease discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being considered.
In addition, there are the conditions necessary for the successful change of media and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Cornivores belong to the Coronavibe family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive polar branch of RNA.
These viruses, with the largest RNA virus-containing genome containing between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides, have been named because of their form, which, when viewed under an electronic microscope, resembles the crown.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain non-segmented genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (OF1a and ORF1b), which are transmitted to replica polyproteins pp1a and pp1b.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins as indicated by nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading frame for structured proteins, including squiggly protein (S), membrane protein (E), membrane protein (M) and Nucleoprotein (N).
Other coronavirus lines have also coded a number of line-specific acesor proteins.
On the basis of the differences in protein sequences,\ coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma and deltakornivores), and the species includes most of the human coronaviruses and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogeutic evidence is available that most alpha- and betaconics are genetically derived from bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoirs for gamma and deltacornirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecies, and some have evolved to dangerous pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses have been known.
These include human alpha-corporated HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63.
The remaining five betakornivores include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV) and the severe acute acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV-2).
Human coronaviruses HCOV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild-form symptoms such as cold and (or) diarrhea.
In contrast, the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV viruses and the recently detected ATS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher risk of acute respiratory disease (ARS) and the presence of non-serious symptoms.
The first thread of the HCOV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of a nodule removed from patients who had a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has resulted in more detailed knowledge of HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that the human coronavirus was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were affected and the overall mortality rate was about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long-term epidemic on the Arabian peninsula, with the disease spreading periodically to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus discovered in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed ATS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current epidemic of coronaviral infection 2019 (COVID-19), which, as of 3 March 2020, had more than 3,120 lives, and the number of people infected had exceeded 91,000.
The alarm signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are of Zoonous origin, and their sources are flying mice, mice or domestic animals.
Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of all human coronaviruses from bats, to which viruses have been well adapted and in which pathogenic characteristics are not manifest, but show wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has left China and the world a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
A study of the zoonic mechanism of the origin of human coronaviruses will allow us to understand their natural history, the driving forces behind their evolution and the factors limiting inter-species transport.
It may also suggest or accelerate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate and amplifying container, which is essential to prevent the resurgence of the disease in the future.
This review provides general information on the zonal origin, inter-species transmission and human coronavirus pathogen.
In particular, we note and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses occurred are not usually pathogens for their reservoirs, but become pathogenic after inter-species transmission to the new bearer.
We are also analysing the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 flash is considered.
Animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the strain of B814 of the HCOV-229E virus was first derived from a sample of cold-prone patients separated from their nostril, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides a brief and informative history of detection of human coronaviruses.
The first strain of the HCOV-229E virus was derived from samples taken from the respiratory tracts of patients with an infection in the upper respiratory tracts in 1966; it was further adapted to the reproduction of the WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with the HCOV-229E virus showed cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezes, general infirmities and throat pains, while high temperatures and coughs were observed between 10 and 20 per cent.
Later, in 1967, the HCOV-OC43 virus was released from the organic culture and subsequent serial paste into the brain of mouse suckers.
The clinical evidence of HCV-OC43 infection is similar to that of the HCV-229E virus, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens such as Type A flu virus and riniviruses.
Both the HCOV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus are worldwide and are generally transmitted at moderate latitudes during wintertime.
Most of the period of the two viruses is less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to a study of volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCOV-229E virus developed a common cold of light shape.
Only a few patients with reduced immunity had severe lower respiratory infections.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the “apical pneumonia epidemic”, was the first well-documented human coroner in human history and was the cause of the disease of the SAS-CoV virus, the third of the identified human coron virus.
The first case of ATS was found in the Chinese province of Guangdong in late 2002.
During the ATS epidemic, 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread in many countries and on various continents.
Without considering superactive distributors, it was estimated that each person might be infected by approximately two more people; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days, and the peak of the virus load was 10 days.
The patients infected by ATS-CoV were initially in pain in the muscles, headaches, high temperatures, general infirmities and chills, while the later symptoms included exhalation, cough and respiratory deficiency.
Lab laboratory deviations from the SARS standard are lymphopia, liver disorders and higher levels of creitinase.
The SAS patients also experience diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell lysion and macrophage rise.
Some 20-30 per cent of patients subsequently need intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In these difficult cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tracts, other organs may also be infected, including stomach, liver and kidney organs, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may prove fatal, particularly for patients with reduced immunity.
For the first time, the virus was released from the open biopsy of a relative of the patient’s lungs who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been directed towards research into human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCOV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found that it primarily affected young children, older persons and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory diseases.
The disease caused by HCOV-NL63 is characterized by such manifestations as sludge, condensationvit, high temperature and bronchiolite.
Another independent study describes the release of the same virus from nasal material taken from an eight-month-old boy from the Netherlands who suffers from pneumonia.
The virus was detected in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, and that the peaks of their diseases occur at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is linked to an obsessive laringitis, which is also called a grain.
HCOV-HKU1 was allocated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
In addition to anesthetic pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 is linked to an increase in asthmal diseases.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 virus, which causes respiratory diseases of light form, has been detected throughout the world.
All of these four coronary human coronary infections are well adapted to people, and their mutation, with highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents and their causes are unknown, as in the rare example with the more virulent HCOV-NL63 subtype, which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious infection of the lower respiratory pathways in China.
Usually, the acquired ability to transmit and maintain effectively in the human body makes these human coronaviruses less virulent or pathogenic.
The Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first released in Saudi Arabia in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most laboratoryly confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there have been cases of trafficking and distribution through episodeal secondary infections in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical evidence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resembles the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike ATS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute kidney failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronaviruses passed on to the person.
More than 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratoryly confirmed cases of high-death Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent) had been reported, so MERS-CoV was one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
From mid to late December 2019, Hubei Province of China identified clusters of patients with pneumonia, which are now linked back to the infection caused by type 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization announced that the continuing outbreak of respiratory infections caused by the SARS-CoV-2 was a global public health emergency, and the disease itself had been referred to as “cornerary infection 19” (COVID-19).
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4 per cent.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in Hubei Province of China is 4.2 per cent and outside the province 1.2 per cent.
SAS-COV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by an increase in temperature, cough and breathing.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to quickly develop into acute respiratory failure.
Despite the similarities between SAS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homologie of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of phylonetic wood.
SAS-COV-2 is obviously less pathogenic but has a higher transmission capacity than SAS-CoV and MERS-COV.
There have been cases of unsymptomous infections of the SAS-CoV-2, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly throughout the world.
By comparing and comparing ATS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, important similarities and differences are identified.
First, the coronaviruses transmitted to a person have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this regard, the SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, in terms of the severity of COVID-19 symptoms, lies between SAS-CoV and four human coronaviruses that cause extracurricular infections (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SAS-CoV-2 infections are similar to those found most frequently in human coronaviruses that cause extracurricular infections, including non-specific events, mild symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, like the SARS-CoV infection, a small sub-group of heavy COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, there are also interesting patterns in the transmission of ATS-CoV-2, both for human coronaviruses that cause extra-curricular infections and for SAS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of ATS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses causing extracurricular infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmission of ATS-CoV-2 is decreasing with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e., the infection of each of the following persons), as in the cases of ATS-CoV and MERS-COV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause extra-curricular infections, SAS-CoV-2 can be detected in samples of kala.
We have yet to answer the question as to whether the fecal-oral path of the SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least under some circumstances) as that of the SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of the SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause extracurricular infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 will depend on the characteristics of the ATS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after crossing through people.
All four human coroneracies that cause extracurricular infections with mild - shape symptoms were well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, it may be people who have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be described as the only survivors of the pandemics of human coronaviruses in the past.
The human coronaviruses that cause severe diseases in humans and those that cause severe diseases in the human coronaviruses simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be repetitive in the human body to the extent that there is an accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the limitations of the media.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks continue and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus is fully adapted to the human being.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop it by quarantine or other communicable disease control measures.
For many years, four extracurricular coroneres have been circulating among the population, causing a common cold for people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require a reservoir animal.
The highly man-made coronaviruses of SAS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well enough, and their transmission to humans cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and reproduce in their zoning tanks and to seek cases of vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying media.
The SAS-CoV-2 has features similar to SAS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCV extracurricular viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as an outpatient HCOV, at least for the time being.
But it's more pathogenic than non-patient HCOV and less pathogen than ATS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether he will be fully adapted to the human being and whether he will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrying him.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCOV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and reservoir HCOV viruses.
The animal is an evolutionary host of HCOV if it is carrying a near-born ancestor with the same high homologie at the level of nucleotides sequence.
The ancient virus is usually well adapted and is nonpathogenic in this medium.
Similarly, the reservary carries HCoV continuously for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCOV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only stuck in an intermediate medium just before or about the time when it was captured by a person, it was not well adapted to the new medium and was often pathogenic.
This intermediate medium can serve as an zoonic source of human infection and can play an increasing role by allowing the virus to be repetitive and then passing it on to people, increasing the rate of infection.
HCOV can carry a dead end if it cannot withstand transmission inside an intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCOV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate medium and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate medium becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data have shown retrospectively that the SARS zero patient had contact with hunting animals (children) in anamnesia.
Further studies of segregation showed that animal dealers have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies than the population as a whole.
The Himalayan cyvets (Paguma larvata) and the ventolike dog in the living animal market were the first viruses identified by the bearers, similar to and almost identical to SAS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all cytics in the markets, there were no further reported cases of ATS.
However, it was reported that Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms and not entering markets were in most cases not defined by SAS-CoV, which leads to the conclusion that Himalayan cyves could serve only as an intermediate strengthening medium rather than a natural SAS-CoV reservoir.
It is noteworthy that, since 80 per cent of the different animals in the Guangzhou market have antibodies to SAS-CoV, the possibility that many small mammals can also serve as intermediate boosters cannot be excluded.
They all seem to be the dead end of the SARS-CoV virus.
The subsequent search for the natural SARS-CoV animal revealed a near-born CoV flying mice that had been named the coroner - related coroner - coroner - HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which was present in the Chinese fly - bearing mice.
These mice are positive on the sarS-CoV antibodies and the genetic sequence of the SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses of bats have 88-92% of the same homology of Nucleotile sequences as the SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundations for a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.
The bats also identified several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV), but none but one that stands for WIV1 can be isolated as a living virus.
The receptor for ATS-CoV is known to be human angiotensin-convertor enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1 derived from the feces of bats uses ACE2 bats, cyvets and humans as receptors for entry into the cell.
It's interesting that the serums of the healing patients with SAS could neutralize WIV1.
To date WIV1 is the closest ancestral ancestor of ATS-CoV in bats, dividing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct parent of the SARS-CoV virus and that bats are not a direct SAS-CoV reservoir.
Phyogenic analysis refers to the same group of MERS-CoV as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same media receptor, diceptildiptide-4 (DPP4), to infiltrate viruses.
The sequence of the MERS-CoV pherogeneous RNA-dependent polymers virus is phylonetically closer to the series of fliers found in Europe and Africa from the BTAC.
So far, wild bats have not found the living MERS-CoV virus.
The homology of the nucleotid sequences of MERS-CoV and his closest relative CoV-HKU25 of bats coincides only 87%.
I mean, flying mice might not have been a direct reservoir of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single camels are seroppositing to neutral antitels specific to MERS-CoV, as are camels of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was derived from single camel nasal brushes, which further confirms the role of camels as true MERS-CoV reservoirs.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected by MERS-CoV have had minor symptoms, but a massive virus.
It is noteworthy that infected camels have identified the virus not only by respiratory means but also by fecal-oral means, which is also the main means of releasing the virus from bats.
However, questions still remain, since many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome have not had contact with camels in an amnesia prior to symptoms and are likely to be attributed to human transmission or to the transfer of unknown channels, including unidentified species of animals that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The nucleotides nucleotide nucleotides SRS-CoV-2 are 96.2% co-ordinated with the CoV RaTTG13 of flying mice released from the Asian subwovens of Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SAS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference between SAS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to attribute to the parent relationship.
In other words, flying mice could not be a direct SARS-CoV-2 reservoir unless they found in the future almost identical coronaviruses of bats.
It is suggested that the direct SARS-COV-2 animal population should be among the wild species sold and killed on the Uhanese wholesale market for seafood, which was linked to many of the early cases of COVID-19, indicating a possible transfer from the animal to the animal.
A number of recent studies based on metagenic segregation have concluded that a group of small mammals in danger of extinction known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also carry a parent's betakoronnivore, akin to the Sars-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the sequences of nucleotides of these new coroner's pathogens is 85 to 92 per cent consistent with SAS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to the Ratag13, with about 90% of the identity of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two levels of differentiation of viruses such as SAS-CoV-2 in a phylotechnic tree, one of which has a receptor binding domain (RS) closer to SAS-CoV-2 and the identity of amino acid sequences of 97.4%.
On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 strains are more complex, despite the higher degree of homology of sequences in the entire genome.
An earlier study of Pangol patients also reported on the definition of viral contagions in lung samples that were similarly related to SAS-CoV-2.
The study used other techniques of assembly and manual processing to produce a sequence of a genome comprising about 86.3 per cent of a full-scale virus genome.
The possibility of pangolin becoming one of the intermediate SARS-CoV-2 animals cannot be ruled out.
However, due to the difference in the sequence between the SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 baccoronnios, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of the SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SAS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even shorter than between SAS-COV-2 and the SARS-COV-2-related pathocronnivores.
The evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 path has not yet been established in bats, pangons and other mammals.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in the RSD between the SAS-CoV-2 and the Betakornivores of the SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 have the highest homology of sequences across the genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between the BTKs of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-COV-2 is linked to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposing proposal is in favour of recombining between the SARS-CoV-2 and the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force for evolution, recombination is widespread among the Betakornivores.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoning of SAS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCOV viruses, the zoonistic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Philogenic evidence shows that both HCOV-NL63 and HCV-229E may occur from coronaviruses of bats, while the parent viruses of strains of HCV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
It has been reported that the coronavirus of bats, named ARCOV.2, found in the North American tricolored sac, shows a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E is genetically linked to another coronavirus of bats called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although it was suspected that its intermediate bearer might have been camels.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of the known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
Phyogenic analysis provided evidence of HCOV inter-species in anamnesia.
When the HCV-OC43 virus was transmitted in interspecies around 1890, and people were infected by domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of the HCOV-229E interspecies transmission is not so clear.
Alpha-corners of bats, near-genocular HCOV-229E, were found.
Between them is the alpha - crowned alpaca.
Some data support the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could communicate with bats in the general environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpacas.
Second, the alpha coroneria of bats, related to HCOV-229E, has a variety of and non-patogenic mice, while the alpha coroner of the alpaca has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alpha - crown was not found in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that the alpacas may have received alpha coronerus, which is related to HCOV-229E, from humans.
In fact, flying mice are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nippach virus and the Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that flying mice could directly pass on HCOV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while alpha-coronnivore mice could serve as a dung pool of the HCOV-229E virus, the alpacas and single camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to people, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to single camels and from single camels to a man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its original identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.
Evidently, bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies exchanges and interspecies transmissions.
Long-term, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make bats “ideal spreaders”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single camels decades ago.
He adapted well to these camels, which became a stable and natural reservoir from the intermediate medium.
These animals have the MERS-CoV virus that causes a very mild disease and have a relatively low rate of mutation.
Its passing on to a human being is an accident, and the person remains the dead end of the MERS-CoV, since its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of panguns, if any, in the transmission of the SAS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, the BTKs are highly pathogenic to the Panguns.
They may also be dead end-users of betakonnivores related to ATS-CoV-2, as well as cyves in the case of ATS-CoV.
Future studies need to confirm or exclude several possibilities for inter-species transmission of the ATS-CoV-2 virus to human beings.
First, flying mice can be a reservoir for a virus similar to SAS-CoV-2, almost identical to SAS-COV-2.
Humans can share the environmental niche with flying mice by coal mining or cutting off the carcasses of these animals.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate strengthening media into which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently spread.
Humans are infected by the virus through carcasses and by the consumption of wild animals for food.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are receptive to ATS-CoV-2.
Surveys of domestic and wild animals on antibodies are justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of the SAS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third form, which has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, the three main factors from viruses have also contributed to interspecies barriers.
First of all, they're relatively high mutation rates in RNA reproduction.
Compared to other viruses with single-chain RNAs, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered “moderately high” with an average replacement rate of approximately 10 - 4 per year at one site 2, depending on the adaptation phase of the coronary to the new masters.
Cornivores have a correcting exorobiconuclease, whose removal results in extremely high mutation frequency and a weakening or even inviolability.
It is interesting that the nucleotid analog of Remdesivir suppresses coronavirus reproduction through the inflammation of this exorobonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
The remdessir is one of the most promising tools against the SAS-CoV-2 that needs to be checked in clinical research.
Nevertheless, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than their own.
In addition, mutation frequency can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the bearer.
Compared to ATS-CoV with high mutation frequency, the frequency of the SAS-CoV-2 mutations appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Supposedly, the virus has already adapted to another medium close to a human being.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that vaccines and anti-virus drugs from ATS-CoV-2 will quickly lose efficiency as a result of genetic drift.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses results in greater plasticity in the genetic modification of mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-species coevolution, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses where appropriate.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open-ended protein reading and functions coded in the direction of the 3° end of the genome.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch over during RNA reproduction.
During the transpiration of the DNA of the coronary in the media, which serves as a mixing vessel, a switch of threads often occurs.
High-tech, full-scale and sub-genic RNAs can recombinate and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCOV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and in coronavirus animals, such as SL-COV and BatCOV-HKU9 bats.
Interplay of the virus with regard to transmission
In addition to the three above-mentioned virus factors, the interaction of the virus with the receptor of the medium is another key factor for inter-species transmission.
The article provides a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection in inter-species events, by the SARS-CoV.
Based on a comparative analysis between the human SARS-CoV strains and cyves, ATS-CoV is considered to be subject to rapid adaptation in different media, especially with regard to mutations on the S protein RSD.
In general, RSD Protein S coronavirus interacts with a cellular receptor and the reaction of the media antibodies is intensively selected.
The RSD in SAS-CoV is the amino acids, from the 318th to the 510th, on the S1 section, which connects the virus to angiotensin fermentant 2 (APF2) of a human being, as well as its receptors.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD can recognize the receptors of APF2 of different animals, including bats, civets, mice and antodic dogs, allowing inter-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in the RSD, which is different from viral human strains and civets, of which 4 are in the receptor-linking motive for interaction with the APF receptor.
The SAS-CoV civets have mutations of K479N and S487T in the RSD, which can enhance the interaction of the schizolar with the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two substitutes for amino acids can be particularly important in adapting the virus to a human being.
It is worth noting that ATS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as ATS-CoV.
The 30 per cent difference between the SARS-CoV-2 and the SAS-CoV segment of S1 protein S leads to a possible change in the interdependency of S protein to human APF2.
Indeed, research using a cryoelectron microscope indicates that this link is 10 to 20 times higher than between APF2 and the S protein of the SAS-CoV virus.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other anchors were required for the transmission of ATS-CoV-2.
It's surprising that HCOV-NL63 is also linked to APF2, but to another segment of S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N amino herb for HCOV-229E and 9-O acetylic acid for HCV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses to humans after inter-species transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of inter-species HCOV is also controlled by other dependency factors and limitations of the media.
The distinction between human and natural HCVs, such as bats, single camels and rodents, may constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
For successful inter-species transmission of the HCV virus, dependency factors must be usurped and media retraction factors must be subordinated.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the bearer still need to be defined and categorized.
An impartial, fully man-made screening of media dependence and restriction factors for ATS-CoV-2 can produce good results through the latest CRISPR technology.
Origin of new HCoVs: back to zero
The variety of coronaviruses of bats provides a wide range of opportunities for new HCOVs.
In this sense, the coronaviruses of bats serve as a genetic pool for HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein - coding genes has the potential to radically modify phenops of viruses.
Among the accessor proteins, the ATS-CoV is considered to be important for human adaptation because the viruses of bats, like SARS-CoV, have been isolated but have been found to be coded for the disintegrated proteins of ORF8.
In the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide-deactivation characteristic of the SARS-CoV coronaviruses was detected.
It breaks the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to be an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of media.
In addition, SAS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-macornivorous lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
The localization of the recombination was also defined in non-structured proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SAS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCVs where HCV has been recombined with other animal coronaviruses in its non-structured genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in the virus genomes, which is likely to result from the removal of the virus from the selection pressure, for example from the immune system of the media.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-sized ORF4 in the prototype strain HCOV-229E due to binucleotide deviation.
While the intact open reading frame of the ORF4 can be seen in the viruses of the flying mouse and camels related to the HCOV-229E, the alpha coronerus of the alpacas shows a single nucleotide box, causing the frame to shift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCOVs is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoirs.
In the case of flying mice, coronaviruses showed weak or non-existent symptoms, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, the failure to activate an arson response in bats effectively reduces the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats has been suppressed by the migration of a natural NKG2/CD94 receptor receptor and the low level of expression of the molecules of the main class I histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, high levels of active oxygen forms, which are ensured by high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress coronary reproduction, at the same time affecting the reading of exorobiconuclease, thus creating a pressure of selection to generate strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when entering the new media.
The more pathogenic strains of the coronary may also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the media.
Thus, it is no coincidence that over the past 20 years, three new human coronarians have emerged.
Cornivores are nonpathogenic or cause light symptoms in their reservoirs, such as flying mice or camels.
They're repetitive without causing a strong immune response from the media.
This is the secret to why we see unsymptomized media and what causes serious cases of human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to immune response hypertension and a cytokine storm, with the stronger immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
On the contrary, the immune response does not involve the reproducing of the coronary.
The same non-immune response strategy can have positive effects on treatment against ATS-CoV-2.
Flying mice have a particularly powerful interferonal response.
Thus, interferon I-type acceptances, at least in the initial phase of the infection, SAS-CoV-2, should be beneficial for people.
In addition, NLRP3-inflammasomas have been damaged in bats.
On this basis, inhalation of NLRP3-inflammmasomas by MCC950 may prove useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SAS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern followed by ATS-CoV and MERS-COV.
While a 95% nucleotide homology has been found to match SAS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of bats, the nucleotide homology of which coincides with ATS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that cyvets and other animals on the market are carrying viruses identical to SAS-CoV, no direct intermediate media for SAS-CoV-2 were installed.
The pangolin betakornivores were found to be amazing homologous SAS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins could serve as an intermediate medium or that fragments of the genes of the pangolins could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by human beings.
Cornivorouss have attracted universal attention because of the recent outbreak of ATS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of the zoonic origin and HCOV animal resources in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are from bats and have been handed over to a person through intermediate media.
If the ATS-CoV infection occurs from contact between people and cyves in markets, the closure of wildlife markets and the destruction of cytrates on them could effectively put an end to the ATS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of a variety of lines of Betakornivores of panguns, near-born SAS-CoV-2, panguns should be removed to prevent zonal transmission of infection from food markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to people through panguns and other mammals and how this may continue to be the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single camels.
These camels are an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in China's wild animals markets, to prevent the spread of ATS-CoV and SAS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, combined with other infectious control measures, to halt periodic MERS outbreaks.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge that generate outbreaks of disease.
A wide variety of zoos ’ coronaviruses are circulating around the world.
In particular, the coronaviruses of flying mice with zoonistic potential are very diverse.
There is a great deal of potential for the evolution and recombination of these zoning coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and (or) more deadly to the human being.
In order to reduce the number of unnecessary contact between humans and animals, a culture of wild animals in some parts of China should be eliminated.
After severe tests, such as ATS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plan are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be seized.
Although many of the characteristics of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, training people to stay away from them can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
In order to better understand the environment of the coronaviruses and their natural media, continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals is required, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoos.
There are still some fragments missing in the puzzle of the Zosonic origin of SAS-CoV-2.
First of all, if the bats passed the ancient SAS-CoV-2 virus on to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances the flying mice and pangolins share the same environmental niche.
Secondly, if flying mice play a more direct role in human transmission, it is important to determine how people have come into contact with flying mice.
Thirdly, if the role of a true intermediate is played by a third mammals, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including man, bats and pangons.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be vulnerable to ATS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a bat, pangolin or other mammals, it is expected that in the future ATS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified from their natural media.
Further research in this field will shed light on the evolutionary path of SAS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for “occupational cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID 19 should be updated.
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief reference manual on the diagnosis and treatment of new coronaviral infections in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and provides sound recommendations to combat the pandemic around the world.
However, coronaviral infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; therefore diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for “responsible cases” and “confirmed cases”, in accordance with the document entitled “Recommendations on diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19” (seventh version), issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, there was a new coronary outbreak in 2019 (2019-nCov), now officially named coronaviral infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus itself was described as “a severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the infection, our group developed a short reference manual and published it on the Internet on February 6, 2020, of the Military Medical Research magazine.
This publication attracted much attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven issues of the “Recommendations on diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19”, published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), were issued, with some of its provisions significantly changing.
The work of Zhou (Zhou) with the co-sponsors recently commented on our recommendations and contained simple diagnosis proposals based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on the global pandemic.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the recommendations on diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 (test seventh version) and on the results of ongoing studies, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh issue of the document (3 March 2020), a component of the epidemiological history must be combined with two clinical manifestations of the disease in order to be fully analysed in the event of a suspected disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movements or locations in Uhan and its surroundings or in other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days of symptoms; (2) history of contacts with patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 (positive testing based on Nuclein acids); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhan and its environs or from other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported over the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases ( :: 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms recorded within two weeks at small sites such as home or apartment, office, class in school, etc.).
Clinical evidence: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external exposures to COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white cells is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for the confirmed case should be based on the case of a disease suspected of having one of the following points of pathogen or serological evidence: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for ATS-CoV-2; (2) the full-scale combination of the virus shows a high level of homogeneity with respect to new coronaviruses; (3) the positive results of the serothesis for the CARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or the change of the test result from the negative test to the positive for the SAS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, or an increase of at least 4 times during the recovery phase for the corresponding acute phase.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of the said document, a real-time PCR test for nucleinic acids in respiratory pathways or blood samples was added.
The pathogen diagnostics of blood samples were added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issue, followed by the need for serological evidence in the seventh issue.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers who have been looking for an optimal set for the detection of nuclein acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from respiratory pathways, including blood sampling, which improves the availability of different samples and contributes to the incorporation of positive test results for specific antibodies into the test criteria for the confirmation of the disease.
There is, however, increasing evidence of the need to exercise caution in treating patients with common symptoms and patients without expressed symptoms.
Thus, the road map presented in Zhou et al. should be updated as it classified persons without clinical symptoms as a “low-risk” group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practices and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspecting cases” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations on time to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19 - a day-to-day maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths resulting from COVID-19 per day.
This is the largest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the reported cases of infection included 114 current cases, as well as 33 patients who had recovered from their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were reported.
In an online briefing, Dr. Mirjaby Sabrina Flora, Director of IEDCR, reported that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of those who died were over the age of 60, two between the ages of 51 and 60, and one between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also reported that two of those killed were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic officer informed the local news agency Anadola that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Maytree clinic in Kuwait.
On Saturday, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obaidul Kwader, announced that public transport would be discontinued for longer than originally planned until the following Saturday.
Public transport was suspended on 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods — medicines, fuel, and food — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March for two persons who returned from Italy and for the wife of one of them.
As of 19 March, the three people had already recovered.
SARS-COV-2 crossed the millions of infections around the world
According to Johns Hawkings University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronaviral infection was more than one million worldwide.
At least 52,000 people were killed by the COVID-19 coroner.
The movement came on the same day that Malawi had confirmed the first case of infection and Zambia had the first case of death from the coronary.
North Korea stated that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries where there were no cases of coronaviral infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to Johns Hawkins University data, reported that more than 1,000 deaths from coronaviral infection had been reported in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced increased measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobinin, extended the regime for the isolation of the citizens of the city until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin had previously stated that Russians throughout the country, despite their isolation, would receive salaries until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of extending the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of the vote was 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while earlier the curfew had lasted only from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a curfew from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.
The state governor of Ohio, Mike Deweyn, announced that the regime of domestic isolation in the state had been extended by order until May 1.
Stores in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian Networks of Volworths and Colles have reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at all shops in the country to two and one packages, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions were reported in cashier announcements, as well as on the Facebook web page.
Citizens reportedly began to make emergency stocks because of the fear that COVID-19 might trigger a general isolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Volworths network also restricted the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on 4 and 5 March, respectively, Volworths and Colles had already limited this number to 4 packages.
The Colles trade network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that with the restriction of four packages, “the toilet paper is still being bought too quickly in many stores — one delivery within an hour” and described the demand as “unprecedented”, while ALDI, published on Tuesday as “unanticipated”.
According to the representative of Volworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also restricted this number to two packages.
In order to fill the deficit, Colles ordered larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of supplies, Volworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made stocks for a special share of early sales by Wednesday.
Russell Summerman, executive director of the Australian Ritellers Association, reported that the Ritelers were trying to resupply, but this was complicated by local authorities ' restrictions on the travel schedule of trucks.
He looked forward to increasing the cost of products, as suppliers were trying to meet demand, but less and less favourable offers were available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of the depletion of stocks, some shops could not do business on Wednesdays.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert on retail trade from Queensland University of Technology, explained that shops are filling up every night.
He noted that the toilet paper was a bulky commodity, so the quantity of warehouses was small, and after the sale of the entire product, long rows of shelves remained empty, increasing the sense of lack of stock.
“Coles and Volworths believe that if shelves could be filled in, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers would probably not be so panicked,” says Russell Summerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of the processed toilet paper, Who Gates a Crap, reported the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent brands, reported that they worked 24 hours a day to provide sufficient supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when auctions in Melbourne declined owing to the absence of buyers for the week of Labour Day, some real estate vendors began offering free toilet paper to the first auction participants.
The Thursday edition of the NT News, published in Darwin, included an eight-page tab for cutting and using as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia report of 3 March, first the shops were reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, stating that they did not plan to do so.
Russell Summerman added that other products also benefit from increased demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, gallantry, hand washing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, it was observed Sunday evening that the British supermarket store, Ocado, also restricted the sale of Andres' toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus of ATS-CoV-2.
Despite the fact that the term “pandemia” refers only to the magnitude of the disease and not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to take action:
“All countries together are still in a position to influence the progress of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are involved in the identification, testing, treatment, isolation, surveillance and mobilization of their citizens,” explained the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Teds Adan Guebrius.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming incidence and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
He said in his interview on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than flu has been observed since its inception until a continuous global spread”.
Mr. Gebrius expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen the pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled.”
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak of a public health emergency of international importance and then gave it a new status, the pandemic.
Anthony Fauchi, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Illustrative Diseases, said about the outbreak: “This is just the beginning, it's going to get worse.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The coronary pandemic of 2019-2020 is the current pandemic of coronaviral disease of 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uhan, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and regions, killing some 97,000 people.
Some 364,000 people were cured.
China's mortality rate is 4 per cent, while in the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficult breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distension syndrome.
The time range from first symptoms to peaks is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment has been found at present.
The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, coughing of mouth, respect for the distance between people, identification and self-insuring of people suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, to the postponement or elimination of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, and to widespread shortages of goods exacerbated by panic-torn purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 per cent of the world ' s students.
The Internet has begun to disseminate information about the virus, xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese nationals, other East and South-East Asian citizens or people who resemble them, and against other groups of people living in areas where there are significant cases of the spread of the virus.
As a result of the reduction in the number of trips and closures of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, health-care authorities in Uhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, reported that cases of pneumonia had been reported for an unknown reason, and an investigation had been initiated in early January 2020.
The cases of infection were mainly related to Juan's wholesale market for seafood, and the virus is believed to be of zonosome origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is a recently discovered virus with great similarities to the coronaviruses of the bat, the coronaviruses of the pangolin and the SAS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case occurred on December 1, 2019, and the victim did not enter the market after that date.
Two thirds of the cases registered in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, in a publication by the South China branch of the Morning Post, which was not verified, it was suggested that the first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident in the province of Hobey on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had decreased but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China had for the first time surpassed the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly understated, inter alia, due to the number of cases with weak symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of infection among young people were reported, with patients aged 19 and younger making up less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide, and the United Kingdom’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Wallans, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected before effective group immunity was established in the country.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been positive under the official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, a formal policy had been adopted not to test with only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March showed that 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected in China by 23 January and that such unregistered patients had become a source of infection for 79 per cent of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the figure may be 5.7.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 are well cured.
In other, more complex cases, between the beginning of the symptoms and the time of death, the symptoms ranged from 6 to 41 days, and the most frequent period was 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, some 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were in persons over the age of 60, while 75 per cent of those who died had related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include data on the deaths of patients with positive results from COVID tests performed under the official protocols.
The actual number of deaths due to COVID19 may be much higher, as official figures may not include the dead who have not been tested — for example, in the event of death at home, in homes of the elderly, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic has exceeded the official figures for COVII by 4-5 times.
The U.S. Spokesperson for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: “We know that [the declared number of deaths] is lower than actual.” He is confirmed by reports of some single cases in the United States, which are often reported under-reporting in pandemics such as the H1N1 pig influenza epidemic, and the first confirmed death was recorded in Uhana on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and outside Asia in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods were commonly used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary according to the region and time of the disease; they are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, treatment schemes used, the timing of the outbreak of the disease and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health, and the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases of infection within the given period of time.
According to statistics from Johns Hawkins University, as at 10 April 2020 the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97,039/1,617,204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality to morbidity ratio has dropped from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of the mortality rate from the disease (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients who die of the disease and the percentage of deaths from infection (IFR) - which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the figures of certain population groups from the time of infection until the end of the disease.
Some scientists tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
The Oxford University Center for Evidence Medicine estimates that the overall mortality rate of the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random testing of COVID-19 in Germany, as well as a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the precise duration of the flash are not measurable and may vary according to location.
Macei Boni, a staff member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to come out on the plateau and then, when the number of available carriers is exhausted, they begin to die.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast as to when this will occur.”
The Chinese Government's Senior Medical Adviser, Jung Nanchan, claims that “it can end by June” if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucarski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “may be circulating for a year or two”.
According to a study by the Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) is established), physical and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a staff member of the University of Vanderbilt, believes: “I don't think that this coronavirus will ever disappear by itself because it's so easily transmitted” and that it “may turn into a seasonal disease every year.”
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may suffer without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are high temperatures (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Fewer common symptoms include fatigue, sputum in respiratory pathways (below), loss of ovation, absconding, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headaches, vomiting, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO claims to have serious respiratory problems for about 1 in 6 people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) list urgent symptoms such as respiratory problems, permanent pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty in waking and bruised faces or lips, and if these symptoms are present, medical treatment should be sought immediately. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distension, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may have an unsymptomy, without any clinical evidence, but tests confirm that they are infected, and doctors recommend placing persons who are in close contact with patients diagnosed under strict surveillance and testing for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the number of cases of unsymptomous disease varies from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; normally it is five days; until now, it is not fully clear about the symptoms of ovation loss: the initial estimate of the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptom was 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details of the pathways of the disease are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is transmitted mainly during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air along with cough, sneeze, or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some open cough studies, the drops can extend from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
It is assumed that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that are thrown into the air during the conversation, which can stay in the air for a longer period of time, and that the respiratory drops can also be formed by exhaling, including during the conversation, although the virus is not normally carried by air.
The drops can reach the mouth or nose of people nearby, as well as the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (SLR), may lead to the spraying of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.
It may also penetrate the body if a person touches the contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his or her eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through fecals, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese Government denies the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission of the ATS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days after the symptoms appear, although it may occur before or at later stages of the disease.
There were cases in which tests were positive three days before the symptoms appeared, indicating that the virus could be transmitted before the symptoms were expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of unsymptomized disease, but studies to monitor contacts in some countries have also revealed cases of transmission from unsymptomized media.
The staff of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that it is not yet fully clear how easily the virus spreads, however, one patient is known to be usually infected by 2-3 other persons, and is able to survive on the surface from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304), the virus could live for up to three days, on a cardboard surface for one day, and on copper surfaces for up to four hours.
The data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, and positive results for COVID-19 have been obtained from both domestic and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as they did after contact with other surfaces that could be touched by infected people.
The severe acute coronaviral syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group of acute respiratory diseases reported in Uhan.
All of the signs of the new SAS-CoV-2 virus are found in the nature of the coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by means of domestic soap that dissolves its protective shell.
He's supposed to be of Zoon origin.
The genetic analysis of the coronary has shown that it is genetically clustered with the species Betacronavirus, the skin of Sarbetovirus (cell line B), together with two other strains of bats.
At the holistic level, it is 96 per cent identical to other specimens of the coronary mouse (BatCov Ratag13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the order of the genome of the Panglon and human viruses.
A single-genome comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92%) is between the coronavirus of the pangolin and the SAS-CoV-2, but this is not sufficient to prove that the pangolins are intermediate owners of the virus.
The virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this must ultimately be confirmed by an analysis of a polymerosed chain reaction with reverse transpiration (RT-PCR) of the infected secret or computer scan.
A study comparing PCR methods with those used in Uhan showed that the CTC is much more sensitive than PCRs, although less specific because many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease current processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use the CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19”.
WHO published several RNA test protocols for ATS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are carried out.
It can be carried out on breathing samples and on blood samples.
The results are usually available for several hours to several days.
A nosoil brush is usually used for the test, although a grain brush may also be used. A number of laboratories and companies develop serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them had been accurate enough to obtain universal approval.
In the United States, only certified laboratories were approved for emergency testing by Cellex.
Characteristics of the visualization of symptoms on X-rays and computer scans (CTs) include asymmetrical peripheral disturbances by type of mat glass and the absence of plebular vents.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for the development of an international database of confirmed cases of infection.
Because of similarities with other infections, such as the adnovirus, when identifying COVID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
In China, a major study was carried out comparing the results of the thorax and PCR testing and it was found that while the images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be decrypted more quickly; they can also be more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be seen as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
In order to diagnose the virus using X-rays and computer-based tomography, back-up neural networks have been developed on the basis of artificial intelligence.
Strategies for preventing transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mercury by dirty hands, and the use of napkins in coughing or teapots, which should be thrown immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that physical distance from people be recommended; many Governments recommend refraining from any short-term visits to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus has been spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread to a population where some members do not know where and how they were infected, and health workers who care for patients who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautions, as well as precautionary measures in contact with other people and the means of eye protection, and monitoring contacts is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of the infection and prevent its further spread.
The use of data on the location of citizens by Governments through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (Amnesty), as well as over 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring that this type of monitoring be restricted.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as at 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working to develop solutions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data - for example, recording user proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the user of the mobile phone has been in close contact with the person whose COVID-19 test proved to be positive, he is given notice. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection, such as the bow and mouth, which are in fact ineffective.
There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working on its establishment.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends washing hands with soap and water more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or with severe hand contamination, and before eating, after shrivelling, coughing or sneeze.
This is necessary because, while outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens up its protective lining.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to treat hands on an alcohol-based basis with at least 60 per cent alcohol content.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated by a number of solutions (the stainless steel surface of the disinfectant starts to function a minute after application) with 62 to 71 per cent ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent isopropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent podioxide.
Other components, such as benzalconium chlorhexide and glucose, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if suspected of COVID or confirmed in an institution such as an office or a day-care facility, all spaces of such a facility, including offices, toilets, public premises, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and bankers used by sick people, should be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that coughing or scooping cover the mouth and nose with elbows or napkins and immediately throw away used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to use medical masks, since the use of masks may limit the amount and range of breath products that are scattered in the air when talking, chachania and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, while touching their faces with dirty hands is the main means of infection”. Masks are also recommended to those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of masks actually reduces the number of touchings on the face.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDCs, U.S.A., recommend the wearing of non-medical cloth masks. China has separately stressed the importance of using one-time medical masks by healthy people, especially when they are in close contact with other people (1 m (3 ft) or less).
It is recommended that Hong Kong wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Thai health officials call on people to make face-to-face cloth masks in their home environment and wipe them out daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the streets without masks covering their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has committed all visitors to food stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks a day have been produced since mid-March, medical masks were prescribed for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were required to wear a medical mask while going outside; it was recommended that those who could not buy masks should sew them on their own in the home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an anti-communicable measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contacts between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding human space, using touchless greetings and physical distance from others.
Many Governments in the regions, especially those affected by the outbreak, now prescribe or recommend social distance.
The maximum number of people who can be gathered at one location, as recommended by the United States government and health organizations, was rapidly reduced from 250 (in regions where there were no data on the distribution of COVID-19) to 50 and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two persons into groups. Older persons and people suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and weakened immune systems face increased risk of being seriously infected by the virus. CDC recommends that they remain at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. WHO and other health authorities started to replace the term “social distance” by “physical distance”, thus clarifying the purpose of this measure by reducing physical contact within the framework of social linkages, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be completely excluded from society, rather than remaining in contact with other people by alternative means, some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it was recommended that you have sexual relations only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and in whom you are convinced that the virus does not have its symptoms.
People diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected are recommended home-based isolation.
Health-care agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper isolation, and Governments in many countries have also made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population of the affected areas be placed on quarantine.
High-risk individuals were ordered to be heavily quarantined.
Persons who may have been in contact with the infected COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic were encouraged to stay quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Anti-flash strategies include controlling, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
Controlling the spread of the disease takes place at an early stage and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as other communicable control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease cannot be contained, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to reduce the spread and impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
The reduction of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the base number of infections below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the levelling of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overstretched health services and provide more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with the outbreak include personal prevention, such as hand hygiene, medical masks and isolation; social measures aimed at physical distance such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community involvement in facilitating and participating in such measures; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning. After the seriousness of the outbreak became apparent in China, stronger action was taken to contain the outbreak, such as isolation of entire cities and strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, massive screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, and a system of warning of the movement of infected persons has been set up.
Singapore provided financial support to self-insulated persons who were subjected to severe fines for those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks increased and fined the accumulation of surplus supplies of medicines, and the United Kingdom and the United States modelling showed that there were serious problems with mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
Optimal policies to mitigate the effects of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3 and mortality by twice, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapses of health systems.
Pressure may be the preferred method, but it should be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until a vaccine is developed if it is previously), since otherwise the spread of the disease will resume rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has resulted in social and economic costs.
There are currently no antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19 treatment, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking unreceptive cold drugs, drinking enough liquid and rest can help to ease symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection, and breathing support.
The use of steroids can only harm.
Several compounds previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use for COVID-19 treatment.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and household funds” could alleviate the symptoms caused by ATS-COV-19.
WHO views capacity-building and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the main response to the outbreak.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to facilitate the redeployment of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on testing at COVID-19, the elimination of non-term procedures, where possible, the detection and isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the enhancement of intensive treatment facilities by training staff and increasing the number of available IWL and bed facilities.
There are various theories about where the first case of infection, the so-called “zero patient,” might have arisen.
The first known case of new coronaviral infection occurred on 1 December 2019 in the town of Hubei Province, China.
During the month, the number of coronavirus cases in the province of Hubei has gradually increased.
They were mainly related to the Juan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one of the theories was that the virus had entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus was zonologous. On 26 December, the Hubei provincial clinic recorded a case of mass pneumonia of unknown origin involving Dr. Zhang Tianjin, who reported the case to the Jianang control and prevention centre in Uhan town on 27 December.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at the central clinic in Uhana warned her colleagues about a “SARS-like coroner”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenljan, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumours, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was sentenced by his superiors for causing panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uhania published a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
The health authorities of Uhan reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to initiate the investigation early in January, and in the early stages of the outbreak, the number doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by China ' s New Year ' s holidays and the fact that Uhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by 20 January 2020, there were 6,174 cases of the disease; as of 26 March, the United States had oversaw China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed infections worldwide. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases of infection had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 had died and more than 364,000 had been cured.
About 200 countries and territories have registered at least one reported case of infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Shengen zone have restricted their freedom of movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to control the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory stay of the home, compulsory shelter or isolation), as well as curfews. As of 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population of the United States, were in any form of quarantine, over 50 million were isolated in the Philippines, some 59 million were isolated in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were isolated in some form of isolation, and two days later, the figure increased to 2.6 billion — about one third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Uhan on 1 December 2019; another report, which did not verify the accuracy of the information, stated that the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Zhang Jisyang ' s doctor worked on a case of a mass disease of an unknown type of pneumonia, which was notified by her clinic on 27 December by the Jiangang Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Uhan.
The initial genetic test of patient samples on 27 December 2019 showed the existence of a ATS-like coronary.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uhana issued a public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In response to such notices, the police warned doctors in Uhan about the responsibility for “hearing”.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially stated that there was no “expicuous evidence” of the ability of the newly detected virus to transmit from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, later referred to as the Secretary-General of China's Communist Party, Si Jinping, as “the People's War”.
The events of “the largest quarantine in human history” began to unfold on 23 January, and the Sanitary border and the prohibition of entry to and from Uhan began to be announced and a total of 15 towns in the province of Hobei affected a total of some 57 million people.
The use of personal transport has been banned in the city.
The Chinese New Year observance (25 January) was abolished in many places.
The authorities have also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshensen, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishensen, was subsequently built and received other incoming patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China also re-profiled 14 other facilities in Uhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travellers and extending the Chinese New Year season.
Universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have imposed a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and outside the province of Hobei.
Public transport has been modified and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, a citizen control regime was introduced and it was estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) had experienced some form of open-air restrictions, and after the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities had taken strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international travellers entering the city; as of 23 March, there was only one intra-country transmission on mainland China, which had occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister Lee Katsan of China reported that the spread of internal diseases had largely been halted and the outbreak in China had been controlled.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei other than Uhana were lifted two months after the closure of the province for quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for visa holders or residence permits would be suspended as of 28 March.
Those wishing to come to China would have to apply for a visa in Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on enterprises and factories to resume their work and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On 4 April, at 10 a.m., a national three-minute “minute of silence” was held, which opened a day of mourning for the victims of the coronaviar announced by the Council of State and coincided with the festival of Quinmin, but the central Government requested citizens to pay tribute to the victims online, respecting the physical distance to avoid the recurrence of the COVID-19 outbreak.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 extended to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchongji.
Shinchongji ' s followers came to Tagu from Uhan, which is said to be the source of the outbreak.
As at 22 February, of the 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, the highest level of anxiety was announced in South Korea.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were reported in Korea and increased to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers had confirmed the existence of the virus.
The number of flights has been affected by the outbreak and the flight schedule of airlines has been changed, and South Korea has launched a programme on screening the population for the virus, contact tracking and quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered to be the largest and best in terms of organization worldwide.
The screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile application to all arrivals from abroad, multiple testing of the virus, the results of which were available the following day, and increased testing capacity that allowed daily testing to up to 20,000 people.
The South Korea programme is considered successful in combating the outbreak of disease, despite the fact that entire cities have not been isolated, and that South Korean society was originally divided by President Mun Jae In ' s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called on Mr. Moon to impeach for their view that the Government ' s response to the outbreak of the disease was inadequate.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases per day within four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed on a two-week quarantine.

Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to restrict intercity travel were announced in March, but intensive intercity movements continued prior to the Persian New Year.
Shiite shrines in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, Iran became the focal point for the virus after China in February.
Against the background of allegations of cover-up in Iran, by 28 February, more than 10 countries had reported cases of disease with Iran, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak there could be more serious than the 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members reported positive results on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to release temporarily all prisoners suitable for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons where adequate medical care is lacking.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths per day — the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronavirus had been reported in Iran each hour, and every ten minutes, one new death from the coronary.
According to the representative of WHO, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
US sanctions against Iran are also expected to affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the alleviation of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had reached Italy when two Chinese tourists had positive results from the SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.
The number of infections has increased rapidly, prompting the Government of Italy to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unassociated COVID-19 infection cluster was found later, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed on quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “The entry into and exit of the disease will be closed.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as 100 people had already died in Italy.

As at 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoverys, the majority of which were concentrated in the Lombardria region.
A CNN report noted that this high mortality rate in Italy could be facilitated by a combination of two factors — a large number of older Italians and a lack of capacity to survey all those who are currently suffering from coronavirus.
The United Kingdom had responded to the virus in the most peaceful manner from all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government had not required citizens to observe any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not responding sufficiently quickly and seriously to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all travel and social contacts that were not of primary importance should be refrained, inviting people to work from home and avoid public places, such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible and promised that employees would pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than £2,500 per month, as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent measures for social distance, prohibiting more than two people from gathering and limiting travel and active rest in the fresh air to cases of extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the use of the police, fines and kidnappings.
Most enterprises were ordered to close, with the exception of enterprises that provide “life support for the population”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business shops, gas stations and garages.

Despite this, testing of the population in the United States was not initiated immediately, and the true extent of the outbreak was hidden during this period.
The test was difficult due to the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence by the end of February of a federal government permit to use non-State test kits developed by academic organizations, various companies and clinics, and restrictive criteria to allow citizens to undergo testing before the beginning of March (this could only be done by appointment of a doctor).
The Washington Post reported that by 27 February, fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that by 13 March fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

WHO noted the apparent differences between the outbreak of austere pneumonia that occurred between 2002 and 2004, during which allegations were made against the Chinese authorities of classified information, which allegedly prevented the prevention and control of the disease from spreading, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central Government “regularly provided updated information on the situation in order to avoid panic on the eve of the New Year of China”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban transport in Uhan, the representative of WHO, Goden Galea, noted that “this measure was not explicitly recommended by WHO”, it was also “very important in confirming the fulfilment of the obligation to contain the epidemic at the most common place” and described it as “unprecedented in the history of public health”. On 30 January, after confirmation of the ability of the infection to be transmitted from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of infections in other countries, WHO declared an emergency situation in the public health system of international importance (PHIIC); this situation has been the sixth since 2009 when such a measure was first applied in the context of the pig influenza pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Thatros Adan, said that the announcement of PHEIC was due to “the global spread of the world, particularly in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Thatros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested $675 million from the world community to provide strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need to provide urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the level of preparedness for our weakest epidemic”, and called on the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay for the future.” At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide “the capacity of the entire UN system to respond to the problem”.
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group has been established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, as WHO states, will “concentrate on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to address the outbreak in a broader social and economic way”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc team, which ensured the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in resolving the internal situation and to assess “the seriousness of the disease and its contagion”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of responses at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “peace must do more to prepare for a possible coronary pandemic pandemic, noting that “it is too early to call the disease a pandemic, but countries must nevertheless be prepared to do so”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of global expansion of the coronary would be raised from a “high” to “very high” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: “This is a test by every government on the planet of readiness for reality: it is time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared," and stressed that the right response can help the world to avoid “the worst scenario of events”.
Ryan also stated that current data did not justify the proclamation of the global pandemic by public health officials, and added that the declaration of the pandemic would mean that “we recognize in fact that everyone on the planet would be at risk of contracting the virus”.
On 11 March, WHO declared a pandemic coronary outbreak.
The Director-General of WHO said that WHO was “deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high incidence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction associated with the problem”, WHO was severely criticized for its perceived inadequate approach to the pandemic concept, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the current situation, Mr. Tedros Adalam, Director-General of WHO, was asked to resign, which was signed by 733,000 persons as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized the importance of respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to take measures to save lives and the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other uncertain groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and recommendations.
The digital node contains information on policy measures by various countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the world economy, address quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and to promote a coordinated global response to the corona virus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the British Cabinet Minister Michael Gowa and Eduardo Bolsonor, son of President Jair Bolsonor of Brazil, for his efforts to combat the pandemic, which began in the province of Hubei of China.
Several leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the provincial level have been dismissed for the quarantine measures they have taken in central China, and these dismissals have been a sign of dissatisfaction with the political response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Jinping, against public anger over the outbreak of a coroner.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the coroner’s outbreak began in Uhan, but took sides with the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration called the coronavirus “Chinese virus” or “Uhan’s virus”, stating that “Censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of the virus, which has now become a global pandemic”, which in turn has been criticized by some commentators who claim that this approach is racist and “distracts from the inability of the United States President’s administration to contain the spread of the disease”.
The Daily Beast received access to the U.S. government telegram, which contains a communication strategy designed by the National Security Council, with the following references to the strategy: “It's China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in all possible ways, including press conferences and television presentations.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg stated that China's efforts to assist countries affected by the virus are part of a “promotion” to gain global influence.
The EU Head of Foreign Policy, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through the pyrara and the so-called policy of generosity”.
Borrell also stated that “China insists on promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, as opposed to the United States”.
China has also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and, according to some, to send assistance to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned by the 3 April U.S. sanctions.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of redirecting aid intended for other countries to their own country.
There were also disputes over medical masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has allocated hundreds of IWL equipment intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus coverage of Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, said that “China alone has responded bilaterally.
This does not clearly indicate European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, President Vladimir Putin of Russia arranged for the dispatch of Russian military ambulances, specialized disinfectant transport and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian assistance was “useless or of little use to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on the world's public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President Lombardia Attilio Fontana and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected the media attacks and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
The Spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, stated that “in offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they will also be able to respond if necessary”.
The NATO “Protection 2020” military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the cold war — will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the campaign for nuclear disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized Defender 2020: “In the current public health crisis, these exercises threaten not only the lives of the United States military and many European participating countries, but also those of the countries in which such events are to be held.” The Iranian Government has been severely affected by the virus, and some two dozen members of Parliament have been infected, as well as 15 other current or former politicians.
On 14 March 2020, Iran ' s President Hassan Ruhani, in an open letter, requested the assistance of world leaders, stating that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets for sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran; the epidemic had raised calls on the United States to adopt social policies that were common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified health and childcare system, paid family leave and increased funding for public health.
Politicians expected this to have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, and the pandemic had led to a deterioration in the diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea criticized Japan's “differential and passive quarantine measures” after Japan had announced that any citizen from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine location in a designated Government location.
South Korean society was originally divided by President Moon Jae-in ' s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called on Mr. Moon to impeach for the inadequate response of the Government to the outbreak of the disease; the pandemic had forced countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators express concern that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orbán indefinite authority to administer by decree, suspend the work of Parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of disseminating fair information on the virus and on governmental responses to the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was cited as the cause of several shortages in supply owing to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in panic and the disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings of shortages of medicines and medical equipment, due to increased consumer demand and vendor disruptions.
There were also panicky purchases in several communities, leading to the disappearance of basic necessities such as food, toilet paper and bottled water from the store floors, which in turn resulted in a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adalam, the demand for personal protection has increased 100fold.
This has resulted in a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It has also caused a lack of personal protection tools worldwide, and WHO has warned that health workers will be hit for this reason.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, Daigo buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities led to a shortage of child food in some supermarkets and were subsequently banned by the Australian Government; despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Uhan region, as well as high food demand, severe food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illicit trade in critical products, which have been successful, have avoided the severe food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
North Italy, with small-scale agricultural production, had not experienced significant declines, but industry said that agricultural prices could rise.
The shelves of food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the town of Uhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pigs to ensure that the population was well fed.
Similar laws requiring food producers to store food stocks in case of emergency exist in Italy.
China was affected by the damage to the world economy: according to the media of 16 March, China ' s economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by measures taken by the Government to combat the spread of the virus, resulting in a 20.5 per cent drop in retail sales.
Mother China is a major economic and production centre; therefore, a virus outbreak is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.
According to Agata Demarai, an Economist Intelligence Unit staff member, volatility in markets is expected to continue until there is a clearer understanding of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could outstrip the effects of the 2002 - 2004 epidemic of austere pneumonia.
According to an assessment made by an expert at the University of Washington, St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain can exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact can last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take “urgent measures” following a sharp decline in oil prices due to the decline in demand from China.
On 24 February, world stock markets collapsed owing to a significant increase in the number of people infected by COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing fears about the outbreak of the coronary, various US stock indices, including NASAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow-Jones index for industrial stock, showed the sharpest fall since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1,191 points, the largest one-day fall after the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed a drop of over 10 per cent.
On 28 February, Scope Rattings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating but kept a negative forecast.
The stock fell again because of concerns about the spread of the coronary, and the worst fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with travel bans, closures of public places, including tourist attractions, and recommendations by Governments that no travel be undertaken.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines have cancelled flights owing to a sharp decline in airfare demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and British regional airline Flybe has ceased to exist.
The negative effect on the cruise industry has been stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chong-yun, the main tourist season of China's New Year's celebrations.
A number of events involving large numbers of people were cancelled by national and regional Governments, including annual New Year's Festivals; private companies also closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's events had been cancelled and tourist attractions had been closed to prevent mass accumulations of people; for example, the Ban City had been closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs had been abolished.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and districts of China, the authorities extended the New Year ' s holidays until 10 February, instructing most enterprises not to open before that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong authorities raised their response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared an emergency by closing schools until March and by cancelling the New Year ' s celebration, the retail sector has been affected globally: shop hours have been reduced and some shops have been temporarily closed.
Visits to retail trade points in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March the attendance of trade centres fell by 33 to 43 per cent compared to February.
Trade Point operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitary conditions, installation of facilities to monitor the temperature of visitors and cancellation of activities, and according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million more people than it would have been in a similar situation, but without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Uhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese migrant rural workers found themselves at home in the provinces of their country or locked up in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 47 million people in the United States may be unemployed by the coronary outbreak, and unemployment rates may reach 32 per cent. Self-separation measures imposed in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers on a daily basis unemployed. A study by the Angus Reid Institute revealed that 44 per cent of Canadian households were facing unemployment in one way or another. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost their jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit. Almost half a million companies in Germany moved their employees to a government-subsidised reduced working hours, a part-time job.
The German part-time pay scheme was also introduced in France and Great Britain.
Art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations, as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, throughout the world.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often funded) mission of access to cultural heritage for society by ensuring the safety of their employees and the public and, where possible, supporting the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed for indefinite periods around the world, or access to them had been limited to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and submissions had been cancelled or postponed to other dates.
In exchange, efforts have been made to provide alternative services with digital platforms, yet another recent and growing phenomenon of the spread of the virus: the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered disruptions, and the Vatican announced the abolition of the Christmas Week in Rome, which is held during the last week of the Christian repentant period, the Great Post.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have been broadcast on radio, live television, or on television, while some church leaders have offered to conduct public services.
The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels and areas of St. Peter, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations abolished services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdours.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronary outbreak and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited the access of foreign pilgrims and residents to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the greatest change in the calendar of world sporting events since the Second World War.
Most of the major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Championships League 2019-20, the Prime League 2019-20, the EUFA Euro-2020, the NBA 2019-20 and the NCHL 2019-20 season.
The coronavirus outbreak also destroyed plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transported beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021”. Casino and other gambling facilities around the world were closed and poker tournaments, which were usually broadcast live, were either carried over or cancelled.
This has resulted in many players moving online and many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway theaters, have also abolished all their plays.
As an alternative to traditional off-line activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results over the Internet, providing direct webcasts or web festivals; this helps people in creative professions to continue to perform, publish or publish their works.
The Internet has produced many web sites on the subject of coronavours, many of which are humoric and allay the disturbing sentiments of periods of uncertainty.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, the bias, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as against people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries, have increased.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
Information reports of February (when most infections were still confined to China) recorded racist feelings in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retaliation for anything.
In some African countries, there is also an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many of the people of Uhan and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Both off-line and online support was provided to Chinese citizens as well as their residents living in areas affected by the virus.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a major COVID-19 outbreak; therefore, citizens of such regions may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed a petition at an early stage, insisting that Chinese citizens be prevented from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChinaDontCommeToJapán (Chinese) led Twitter positions.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians residing in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report an increasing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus”, which critics view as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Uhan to New Sanjara.
Students coming from China ' s north-eastern India border and studying in major Indian cities reported cases of persecution related to the coronary outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, President of the State Unit of the Party Bharatia Janatat, West Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “God had therefore avenged them”.
Later, those statements were condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, which described them as “absorption”. In China, the pandemic rekindled xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents: foreigners were referred to as “Foreign debris” and facilities to be “disposed”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information removed such restrictions on some or all areas affected by the coronary.
Many scientific publishers made public their scientific articles on the outbreak of the coronary.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their studies on pre-printer servers, such as bioRxiv.
The spread of the infectious disease is an infectious disease due to the return of the pathogen, the range of which is often unknown or the mode of transmission is not known.

The smuggling of wild animals and diseases from animals is a health risk associated with the trade in exotic animals.
The laboratory testing of the respiratory coroner 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated SAS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the OTP, which will recognize the RNA of the coronary.
The test is specific and intended only for the detection of the SAS-CoV-2 RNA virus.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
Antitel (serology) detection can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have undergone the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated at the hospital, or who were not present at all.
The precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of the test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries was highly contradictory.
These differences in information may have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be considerably exaggerated.
With a polymerosed chain reaction of real-time reverse (RRT-PCR), the test can be conducted on airway samples obtained by various means, including a nasal or sputum brush.
The results are generally available for a period of several hours to 2 days.
The OC-PCR test carried out on throat brushes is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, yet continue to reproduce in the lungs.
An alternative for infected patients tested during the second week of the disease can be taken from the lower airway by means of a drop-down catheter or the use of slurry products (mocrotum).
One of the early tests of the PCR was developed at the Charita clinic in Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymeretic chain reaction with a real-time back-circle (RRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 sets subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, Kogenebiotech, a South Korean company, had developed a set for the detection of ATS-CoV-2 based on a clinical-level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects an E-GI Group gene common to all beta-cornivores, and an RdRp specific to ATS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group has become one of the first companies authorized by the National Drug Administration of China to use the SARS-CoV-2 emergency detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnostic panel through the International Reagent Resource organization for real-time RT-PCR (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Digital Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to married reagents and a narrow CDC test area in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples per day were processed successfully throughout February 2020.
Two-part tests were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was only after that date that the State and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Quality Supervisory Office as part of the emergency use permit, and the US commercial laboratories began testing early in March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that COVID-19 could be tested on the basis of RT-PCRs throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing COVID-19 throughout the country with effect from 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitations were declared; the sampling and processing of analyses should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Centre for Antiviral and Biotechnological Research, “VECTOR”.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervisory Service and it was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for a test which could be conducted for 3.5 hours for large samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, FDA issued an emergency authorization for the use of (EUA) Abbott laboratories for testing the Abbott m2000 system; previously FDA issued such authorizations as Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives EUA from FDA for a 45-minute test.
FDA has also approved a test that replaces PCR with an amplification technology for insulated nuclein acids.
Since this test does not require a series of consecutive temperature cycles, this method can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At present, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day; Taiwan is currently developing a monochloric antibody test, which is specifically linked to the new coronary protein (N-white) and it is hoped that results can be obtained in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a flu express test.
The March 2020 review of specialized literature concluded that “recentgenograms of the chest have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of the CT [computer scan] may be of such value even before symptoms appear”.
The typical features identified by the CTC include bilateral multi-sight sub-plenary compaction units for the type of "mat glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposteur distribution.
Subregional domination, symptoms of a volatile bridge and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing the PCR and TC methods used in Uhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that the CTC is much more sensitive than PCRs, although less specific, because many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19” as of March 2020 for initial screening of CDC recommends the PCR method.
A partial immune response to the infection is expressed in the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect people's infections after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out population control; analyses can be carried out in central laboratories (CLTs) or through on-site diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-production automated systems, but their accessibility will depend on the speed of production of each system.
CLT usually uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples may also be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, one blood sample is usually produced by permeation.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood sampling phase is not required for sampling. On 26 March 2020, FDA named 29 organizations that have completed all the necessary registration procedures and can now pass their test on antibodies.
As of 7 April 2020, FDA approved only one emergency-resolution test. At the end of March 2020, the European Medical Laboratory and Epitopope Diagnostics received European permits to use their test sets, which can detect Igg and IgA antibodies from blood samples capable of combating the virus.
The test output is several hundred samples within a few hours and therefore works much faster than the normal RNA PCR.
In early April, Britain found that no antibody test kits were satisfactory.
A scheme has been developed in Hong Kong to allow patients suspected of being infected to remain at home: “Emergency staff shall transfer a test tube to the patient for test”, the patient spits it, gives it back, and after a while receives the results of the test. British NHS announced its pilot system for testing suspicious cases in the home, which eliminates the risk of infection by the patient of other hospital visitors, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it was used to transport the patient. During an express test on COVID-19 in suspicious cases, the health worker takes an analysis using all appropriate precautions.
The express test centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than any other country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Medical Doctors stated that it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient conditions, and a week earlier they could only do 10,000 tests a week.
If the examination is ordered by a doctor, the costs shall be covered by health insurance.
According to the President of the Institute, the total test productivity of Germany is 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, it was proposed that a test be carried out in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests submitted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of the calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 tests were taken on SAS-CoV-2, up to the week 12/2020, inclusive, and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) were positive. The researchers of Israeli clinics, Technion and Rambam Hospital, developed and tested a method of testing the samples taken from 64 patients simultaneously, combining samples and conducting further analyses only if the combined sample shows a positive result. In Uhan on 5 February 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory with an area of 2,000 square metres to detect emergency cases called Huo-Yan (Chinese – or Fired Eye), which can handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
Construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Jiang and completed in only five days; the simulation showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, the occurrence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher and the costs of quarantine would therefore have been twice as high.
At the opening of the laboratory in Uhan, a total of 12 Chinese cities were immediately opened in Xenjeng, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity of the patients was 50,000 tests per day, with open origami Assays multiplexing schemes that can test up to 1,122 tests of patients on COVID19 using only 93 samples; these balanced structures can work in small laboratories, excluding the need for robotic liquid manipulations.
By March, owing to the shortage and insufficient number of reagents, mass testing in the EU, Great Britain and the United States had become problematic.
As a result, some authors have used test sample processing protocols, which provide for the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates ' s coronavirus testing per capita currently exceeded any other country ' s performance, and soon the majority of the population will be tested.
This was due to the ability for rapid testing, along with the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratories, Huo-Yan in China).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first such large-scale laboratory in the world outside of China.
Various test options aimed at different parts of the genetic profile of the coronary have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of the production of test kits that are sent to low-income countries without resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States health epidemiological centres was not available until 28 January, resulting in a lack of testing kits in the United States. At the beginning of the outbreak in China and the United States of America, there were problems with the reliability of the test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts say, the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronary.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has worked to provide testing opportunities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of increased demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many U.S. private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples, were overloaded, and supplies of materials for the removal of dabs and chemical reagents were quickly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American CDC test kits were "deficit", and for this reason, the Government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented the private development of the tests, Spain acquired testing kits from Shenzen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the use of these sets was inaccurate.
The firm explained that failure of sampling or misuse of sets might be the cause of the inaccuracies.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the incorrect sets and replace them with the other sets — those of Shenzen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the test sets that Czechia had acquired in China had also produced incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets acquired by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović proposed that they be dropped in the Danube; Atesh Kara, a member of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test sets acquired in China had a “high level of error” and the Ministry “did not use them”; Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but early April 2020 declared these sets unusable.
Quarantine measures for those whose analyses have had a positive effect on the SAS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of the people contacted by such patients, have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Vaud, where for the first time in Italy a person died from COVID-19, conducted two testing cycles for an entire population of about 3,400 at intervals of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms and all patients with confirmed cases of illness had been placed on quarantine.
The entry into the settlement area was closed and the measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, the coronary pandemic of 2020 in Singapore was much less intense than in other developed countries, and there were no extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were cancelled, and Singapore began to urge residents to stay at home on 28 March, but the schools, which ended on 23 March, opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, but their limitations were less aggressive.
A statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were performed than in the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because they were able to identify more patients with weak symptoms or lack of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results of the tests to COVID-19 in one of the 16 WHO monitoring laboratories for validation testing.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the next schedule, the indicators of the “positive” column depend on the country-specific testing policy.
A country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher percentage of the positive results than a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, with other equal conditions.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is a process of hand-cleaning to remove pollution, fat, micro-organisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap at certain “critical points” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted fecally.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or a common cold, such as eyes, noses, or mouth (i.e. mucus) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands should be washed with soap: before and after defecation, after raising the child's nails or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned by the ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the care procedures for the sick person.
After changing diapers or putting a kid in the toilet.
After shrivelling, coughing or snorkeling.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
The health of the hands is a health concern related to medical procedures.
The washing of hands before taking drugs or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical goal of hand washing is to clear hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms that can cause disease), as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who prepare food or work in the medical sector, but it is also important for all others.
Hand washing is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronary disease and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
and lowers the infant mortality rate in the home.
A 2013 study showed that better hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhoea by about a third, which is comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income regions.
The 48% reduction in the number of cases of diarrhoea can be linked to washing hands with soap; washing hands with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (ARDs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
pneumonia, one of the main complications of the IRA, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, which kills some 1.8 million children a year.
Almost 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that hand washing before and after eating can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention and reduce diarrhoeal mortality by almost half and acute respiratory infection mortality by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also prevents impeipigo — a disease transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative effect of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to skin drying and thus damage.
A 2012 Danish study showed that too often hand washing can lead to zest and skin-sharp, a disease known as exema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often hand-washing can also be considered a symptom of an obsessive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal ore transmission: after emptying (screeching, defecating), after washing a child's toes (pumping), before feeding a child, before eating and before or after cooking or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where hands should be washed with a view to preventing transmission of the disease: before or after handling a cut or wound, after sneeze, cough or wrinkling, after touching animal waste or animal, after touching the garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is relatively rare.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 showed that, on average, 38.7 per cent of families were washed with soap was a common practice. A 2014 study showed that the highest figure, 97 per cent, was in Saudi Arabia; the U.S. list was closer to the middle, 77 per cent; the lowest was recorded in China, 23 per cent; there are currently several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing habits of washing hands with soap in critical situations; and in developing countries, group washing of hands of schoolchildren at the scheduled time of the day is one of the methodologies that helps to train children to do so.
The Emergency Health Care Programme of the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of a wide-ranging effort to promote child health and education.
This national programme is based on twice a year ' s dehelination, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorine.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if soap or detergents are added during washing.
The main operation of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water in itself is not considered an effective means of cleaning the skin, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are poorly dissolved in water.
Sufficient water, however, contributes to the cleansing process.
Solid soap, because of repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may be found in previous use.
A small number of studies on the contamination of contaminated solid soap bacteria on every cover suggest that this is unlikely to occur because bacteria are mixed with foam.
The CDC still argues that “liquid soap with hand-to-hand dosage is the preferred option for hand washing”.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectant means has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by their nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosane, to which many of the resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic - resistant strains are not selective against antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be in line with advertising.
In addition to surface-active substances and products for the protection of the skin, complex compounds may contain acids (oxynic, asclasarin, milky) as a regulator of pH, as well as antibiotic active benzene and other waste (loe faith, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis carried out by the University of Oregon School of Public Health has shown that in terms of disease prevention and removal of bacteria from the hands, simple varieties of soap are as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclosane.
Hot water, which is comfortable for human skin, is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37 °C.
However, warm soap water is more efficient than cold water to remove natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria.
Contrary to popular opinion, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial loads on hands.
Hand - disinfectant (sanitizer) or hand - septic antiseptic is a hand - hygiene device that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand hygiene tools (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, antiseptics for hand disinfection or sanitation) became popular.
Most of these products are made on the basis of isopylene alcohol or ethanol, with the addition of inhibitors such as carbon dioxide (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel or wetting, such as glycerin in liquid or foam, which makes it convenient to use these drugs and reduces the effects of drying the skin with alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases anti-microbiotic activity; disinfectants containing a minimum of 60-95 per cent of alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multi-drug bacteria (MRSA and VRE), a tuberculosis stick, as well as certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, prinitrus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis) and fungus.
The disinfectant containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% bacteria (the tax of 35 decibels) on hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% of bacteria (the tax of 4-5) on hands 1 minute after use. Hand disinfectants are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are practically ineffective against noroviral (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroentery.
The face and rear surface of both palms, as well as the space between fingers over the entire length, shall grow for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hand washing be chosen rather than the use of disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for complete hand washing if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based disinfectants may cause dry skins if their composition does not contain mitigating agents and (or) wetting agents of the skin.
The effects of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other mitigating substances to the product.
In clinical trials, hand disinfectants on an alcohol-based basis containing mitigating components caused much less irritability and dryness of the skin than soap or anti-microbial cleaning agents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact point syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or supplements present in disinfectants are practically non-existent.
The lower probability of an irritable contact dermatite was a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared with soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, water-free products do not clear hands from organic substances but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic micro-organisms as conventional soap and water, since pathogenic micro-organisms are still on hand when using them.
The efficiency of a disinfectant for hands without alcohol is largely dependent on the components and compositions and has historically been much lower than for alcohol or alcohol-containing substances.
More recently it has been demonstrated that the drugs used in the use of benzalconia chloride have persistent and cumulative anti-microbial activity, as opposed to alcohol, which has been proven to be ineffective after repeated use, probably due to progressive by-products of each reaction.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with gold or clay.
Gold or clay may be more effective than just water, but it will always be less efficient than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, the ash is a disinfectant, since contact with water creates a venous solution.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend the use of hand washing equipment, which includes the following steps:
Chill your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that running water be recommended because standing water may be contaminated, but water temperatures are not important.
Wash your hands by growing them with a large amount of soap, including the back of your hand, as well as areas between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that when soap (not just one water) is used, people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Hold your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Training helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you third your hands, the more microbes are removed.
Be careful to water your hands under the running water.
Hand-cracking in standing water may trigger re-infection.
Wash your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry themselves.
The wet and wet hands are more easily contaminated, and the areas that are most often neglected are the thumb, wrist, finger areas and under the fingernails.
Artificial nails and broken nail blades can contain many micro-organisms.
It is often recommended that wetting lotion be used to prevent drying of the hands, which may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many low-cost ways to wash hands: pouring water out of the hanging canist or bottled pumps with the holes and (or) using the ash, if necessary, as in developing countries; limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries) has water-saving solutions, such as foot fading taps and other low-cost options.
A tap with a foot pedophile is a simple structure consisting of a bag suspended on a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to pour water on its hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of hand hygiene, but there are some disputes over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much more sanitary than electric hand dryers, which are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London sponsored a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Salfets and Towels, which included a comparison of the hygiene of paper cloths, hand dryers with warm air and more modern hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in a warm air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria on the pillows of the fingers increased by an average of 194 per cent and 254 per cent on the palms.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in an air flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the pillows of the fingers increased by 42% and in the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the pillows of the fingers falls to 76% on average and on the palms to 77% on the palms, and scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors to toilet rooms and the environment of the toilet in each type of drying.
An air dryer that emits air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 m/h) is able to blow micro-organisms out of the hands and from its own block and potentially infect other users of the toilet room and sanule within a radius of up to 2 m.
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres [0.25 m] from the dryer.
There was no significant spread of micro-organisms using paper towels, and in 2005 a study was conducted by TÁV Product und Umwelt on various methods of drying hands.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different hand dryers and hand dryers are compared with paper towels.
Hand cleaning with disinfectant napkins may be an alternative solution when traveling without soap and water.
The alcohol-based disinfectant shall contain at least 60 per cent alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing was mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignats Zemelweis found it to be very effective (1846) in preventing inpatient diseases.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget to do so.
According to one study, the use of such devices does help to reduce infection.
The medical washing of hands takes at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and counteract each part of the hand.
Hands should be carefully rubped against each other by crossing your fingers.
If there's dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water in their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
A paper towel should be used after the drying of hands, closing the tap and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors.
This avoids repeated hands contamination from these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic micro-organisms ("microbs") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before they touch patients and thus spread micro-organisms.
According to one study, correct hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce blood flow infections related to the use of catheter by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard hand washing and processing procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO Manual on Hand Health is also available on its website and open to public discussion.
The relevant review was carried out by Whitby co-author.
Commercial devices may be used to measure and verify hand hygiene if regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization indicates five points when it is necessary to wash hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
the use of antiseptics, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to hand washing ("medical" or "anti-microbic" soap") helps destroy bacteria.
These antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery is performed or in an environment with high levels of antibiotic resistant organisms. A tap is required to “cleanse” hands before surgery, which can be turned on and off without touching his hands; a small amount of chlorhexidine or iod water should also be used for arm painting, sterilized hand dryer towels after washing, sterilized friction brush and other sterile tool to clean under the nails.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to lose your hands for too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During stripping, the water from the foreheads must not fall back on the hands.
After the washing is completed, the hands dry with sterile cloth and wear surgical coats.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use antiseptics for the use of hands before and after the treatment of a sick person.
In order to combat staphycular infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20% of hand washing was most beneficial, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when hand washing was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to washing with antibacterial soap, hand washing with regular soap has resulted in more than threefold increases in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food, compared with an antibacterial solution to an antibacterial soap wash, an average of 30 seconds for each procedure, showing that treatment of hands with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand-to-hand alcohol solutions in reducing the number of H1N1 flu virus on the hands and in the Clostridium Diphthel dispute; activities to promote hand hygiene in health facilities may include hand-washing training, increased hand-to-hand availability of alcohol-containing solutions, and written and oral reminders to staff on the need to wash their hands.
Further research is needed on best practices in various health facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap has been recognized as a cost-effective and important means of improving health and even nutrition.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or hand washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to introduce regular washing habits.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are not every private or public toilet that has hand washing taps, although there are cheap ways to do hand washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by established habits rather than by lack of soap or water.
The promotion and promotion of hand-washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate the results.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies has found that community-based health surveillance is effective in improving hand hygiene in middle-income countries, while community-based public marketing campaigns are less effective; one example of advocacy for hand washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Star Approach approach, which promotes simple economic measures in schools that encourage the use of soap to wash the hands of students, as well as other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can raise their levels from one to three stars.
The installation of handcuffs is one possible measure implemented through hand health information campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
The Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour, and as a result of the 2019-20 coronary pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of hand washing emotions.
Some studies reviewed the overall effectiveness of hand-washing in developing countries in comparison with the indicator of DALYs (reserved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more economical solution than other sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for vulnerable groups of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: Ignaz Semmelweis, an English nurse, and “the founder of modern care for the sick”.
At the time, most people still believed that the infections were caused by rotten smells called myasmas.
In the 1980s, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States increased awareness of hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection due to outbreaks of digestive diseases and infections.
As a result of the outbreak of the pig flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, there were posters with “right hand washing techniques” in public toilets, as well as in office buildings and airports.
The phrase “to wash hands” implies a reluctance to accept responsibility for anything or to participate in anything.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “kept washing his hands ” when deciding to crucify Jesus Christ; this phrase was later used more widely in some English communities.
In the "Macbeth" play of Shakespeare, Lady McBeth begins to wash her hands arbitrarily in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain that symbolizes an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes she committed herself and urged her husband to commit.
It has also been established that people who remember or observe any non-ethical act are more likely to wash their hands than others and are more important to them.
Also, it is less likely that people who have been able to wash their hands after what they have seen will participate in any other “cleaning” of countervailing activities, such as volunteering.
In religions the washing of hands has both a hygiene objective and a symbolic meaning: symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baháism, Hinduism, tevilah and net thydayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Woodhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require mandatory washing of hands after a visit to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19
The control of production factors in relation to COVID-19 involves the use of occupational safety and health techniques to control risk and control the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
The proper monitoring of risks in the workplace depends on the place and the job, is based on the assessment of risks, the seriousness of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office of Industrial Health and Safety (OSHA) reported that lower-risk posts had minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, which required basic measures to combat infection, including hand-washing, encouraging workers to remain at home on the grounds of illness, respect for respiratory label, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include workers who contact the public such as schools, high-density jobs and some large retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include high-efficiency air filters, shields and available personal protections in the event of contact with a person infected by COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical personnel and morgues who contact a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are at high risk; the risk is raised to a very high level when such personnel conduct aerosol procedures or collect/process samples from a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of safety and engineering equipment, such as negative ventilation rooms, as well as personal protections suitable for the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak may have different effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from the workplace because of their own illness, the need to care for others or the fear of possible infection.
Business patterns can be changed for both types of goods for which there is demand and ways to purchase such goods (e.g. purchase during non-drug periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Plan for Epidemic Preparedness and Response can be used in the organization of protection.
The plans address the risks associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from home and community, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic illness.
The plans also indicate the controls necessary to address such risks, as well as the contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans for epidemic preparedness and response may be subject to national or state recommendations.
Some of the goals for responding to the epidemic: to reduce the spread of the virus among the staff, to protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, to maintain business operations and to minimize negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses are affected by the severity of diseases in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a widely used structure for occupational safety and health to group such tools according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be addressed, the most effective safety and safety equipment is followed by administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Engineering safety means isolation of staff from workplace-related risks and does not rely on employee behaviour, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures requiring action from an employee or staff member.
Personal protection devices (PPEs) are considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protection equipment must be chosen according to the threat to the employee, be size-friendly (e.g. respirators), be used continuously and properly, be regularly checked, maintained properly and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid infection.
The U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Health (OSHA) is of the view that posts with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
The basic measures to combat the epidemic, recommended for all jobs, include frequent and thorough washing of hands, recommendations for sick workers to remain at home, compliance with the respiratory label, including the closure of the mouth by coughing and scaffolding, the provision of napkins and garbage containers, the availability of remote or replacement work, where necessary, recommendations for employees to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons who are potentially infected is a critical step towards protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that staff members with acute respiratory symptoms remain at home until the heat stops, the absence of high body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever or other medications that eliminate the symptoms, as well as ensuring the flexibility of a sick-leaf politician, allowing staff members to stay at home to care for a sick family member and ensuring that staff members are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a risk of SAS-CoV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the community in the area where the business is located or the recent visits of such a person to the COVID-19 distribution sites.
These categories include employees who have contact with the public, such as schools, high-density working environments and some major retailers. Engineering and safety equipment for such groups and groups with higher-risk groups includes the installation of high-performing air filters, increased ventilation rates, physical barriers such as transparent plastic screens, and the installation of client-friendly eyeglasses without exit. Administrative measures for such groups and higher-risk groups include recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, replacement of personal meetings with virtual means of communication, replacement schedules, termination of non-critical trips to COVID-19 distribution sites, development of emergency communication plans, including a forum for responding to concern questions, provision of relevant training for workers on COVID-19 risks and protection measures, training of workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, proper use of such equipment, provision of resources and the working environment to promote personal hygiene, regular washing of hands, restriction of access to workplaces by employees on the basis of COV risk factors and protection measures, training of workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, adequate use of such equipment, provision of resources and working environment to ensure that the protection of the staff members of the staff may not be subject to be subject to the protection of the security of the security of the staff, or to the security of the staff by means of the security of the staff, or to the staff, or of the staff by means of the facility.
In rare cases, workers from such risk groups may need to carry respiratory personnel.
If a person is sick in an aircraft, measures such as isolation of the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, provision of a mask to the sick person, or request that such a person cover his nose and mouth with a cough or chiachi.
Secondary crew members shall wear one-time medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or when in contact with a physiological liquid or potentially infected surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has heat, regular cough or breathing difficulties.
The gloves used and other non-expendable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected; in the case of commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, safety measures should include the postponement of travel in case of illness, self-insulation and immediate notification of the medical centre on board when heat or other symptoms are present on board.
Ideally, medical examinations should be carried out in an isolated home for such a person; in the case of schools and child-care facilities, CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfecting if the infected person was in the school building regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
When there is a minimum or average rate of infection in the community, social distance strategies may be introduced, such as cancellation of visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as exercise or singing, food reception in cafes, increased distance between desks, time-limits of arrival and care, limiting minor visits, and the use of a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of proliferation in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, measures for long-term school attendance may be considered; for law enforcement officials performing daily duties, direct health risks are considered to be low, according to the CDC.
It is recommended that law enforcement officials who are required to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infections follow the same instructions as prescribed by ambulances, including the use of suitable personal protection.
In cases of close contact during detention, employees must clear and disinfect their formed belts and re-use before reuse by household cleaning aerosols or by means of anti-retroactivity, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the disposal of personal protective equipment used, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health workers and morgues are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical, support, laboratory and medical personnel who are in contact with patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection in their aerosol procedures or in the collection/treatment of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected exposure to COVID-19.
The procedures associated with the formation of aerosols include sensing, coughing, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures and surveys or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue workers include staff working on the treatment of persons with confirmed illness or suspected of contracting COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such officers perform an autopsy, they are placed in a very high-risk category. Additional engineering and safety equipment for such risk groups includes the use of isolated rooms for patients with confirmed illness or suspicion at COVID-19, including in procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.
In some health facilities and morgues, special ventilation with negative pressure may be an effective measure.
The samples should be treated with the safety precautions prescribed for biological safety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the allocation of incoming patients to separate waiting areas, depending on whether COVID-19 is suspected. In addition to other personal protection devices, OSHA recommends the use of respirators by workers working up to 6 feet away with patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections, as well as persons conducting procedures with aerosol formation.
In the U.S., the approved NIOSH respirators for a person with a N95 or higher-grade filter must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection programme that specifies the requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort to the staff member; WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing, since COVID-19 is a respiratory-transmitted disease, rather than through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for personnel performing screening at the patient reception point.
WHO recommends that patients collecting respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 or vectors without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation wear surgical masks, protective glasses or protective screens for the person, coats and gloves.
In the course of procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, the respiratory agent N95 or FFP2 should be carried instead of the surgical mask.
In view of the insufficient availability of personal protection facilities worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protections through the use of remote medical facilities, physical barriers, such transparent window, access to a patient infected by COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of personal protections that are necessary for a specific task, the long-term use of the same respiratory agent, without removing multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protection equipment, and the recommendation not to use masks for persons without symptoms.

THEMA: [Coved19] Load facilitation and preparation for the future
DATE/BEM OF BACKGROUND: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
DECISIONS: CC0: No protected rights
This month, we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the relationship of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen a friendly and caring relationship between all our colleagues, as reflected in e-mails, phone calls, and chat rooms — a remarkable confirmation of the fact that fortunately amazing people are working with us.
I am so grateful and proud to speak of you as my colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of our appreciation for our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to have access to Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it's to make the sites work, to pay our colleagues or to protect the security of the communities.
The world needs the information provided in Wikipedia, and this is even more important today than ever before.
At such times, it is important not only what we do but how we do it in order to achieve meaningful results for the world.
Given the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way we work together, starting with the next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
During our communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and on the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to relieve the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, let it be.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff:
We expect to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before subsequent orders are issued.
We do not announce the weekend: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether to care for your family, to buy food or to go to a doctor, your well - being is our priority number one.
We don't keep track of your working time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It's understandable and unquestioning, but we're talking about it.
There is no need to write a sick sheet or time off: simply inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and time schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, please inform Brian from T&C Ops to ensure that T&C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation.)
The full hourly rate will be paid.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to honour obligations to our contractors and hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid according to normal hourly rates applied in normal circumstances.
This includes periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can produce remarkable results, especially in times like these.
Again, it's self-help.
We ask you to communicate with our leader so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered to be substantial.
Such activities should always be supported.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Foundationing (including others) teams perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and to shift the focus to support, which is critical for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we're just focusing on the most important projects.
The delay today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work twice as hard to make up for what has been lost after the end of the pandemic.
You don't need to work overtime to keep up with unrealistic timelines for the current period.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and timetables where possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the time frame for our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the time frame for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care, while ensuring a shorter schedule for those who need or want to work for the next few weeks.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, providing relevant information to representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as appropriate confirmation is received.
Thank the APP team for their leadership.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
In addition to many precautions, however, we hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used anti-virus decisions from the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator lobbys, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building has its own rules of caution, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared by the time we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Colombia (DC) is located on the WeWork network, which shared with us and all staff in DC its COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in D.C. went completely into remote work, in accordance with instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we have also discussed the issue of rental of premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working further away for the first time.
Our old colleagues, working far away, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings should be limited to one or two hours.
If necessary for longer sessions, consider the possibility of dividing them into a course of several days.
Make clear the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and the distribution of material in advance.
Use video links by default, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and communication.
For ease of reference, appoint a focal point — a person who will follow questions from the chat room and control the list of speakers and the speaker responsible for the notes (or joint notes).
If necessary, use a convenient suit to contact the Technical Support Service by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Rehabilitation program to buy a snack.
Connect to #remoties channel in Sack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomy manuals, which are available in web format, to facilitate the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel the mass activities funded by Wikipedia, such as “editathons”, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such withdrawals and other restrictions may lead to the impossibility of carrying out concerted grant activities, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes in such objectives.
In the coming week, we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikipedia, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The global community's general moods are not only frustration at the interruption, but also a sense of relief from mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikipedia and not only.
With regard to the outlook, CRT is working on the Meta-Wiki page, which will provide a space for the community to monitor effects and communicate.
We remain in contact on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special meeting of staff to be held next Thursday, 2 p.m. UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take advantage of the opportunity to share more relevant information, answer your questions, and spend time together by joining each other.
We are together in this situation and we are ready to help everyone we can.
In doing so, you can continue to receive information from such electronic correspondence and other important information from COVID-19 from Office WikiLeaks.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If questions of travel, activities, key workflows, information coverage problems or other assistance are available, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If there are confidentiality problems, contact Brian Jodan, Director of HR International Global Operations, by e-mail.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a fundamentally new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support one another and to enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary services.
Our planned work will wait for the right time.
Now is the time to support each other and create space for the important work to be done in the coming weeks and possibly months.
For that to happen, we will need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families, as well as to work as hard as possible, once such a need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and the rest of the Leadship Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jane U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-turning enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the respective angiotensin-turning enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angola (1-7) by making it a promising solution for cardiovascular disease treatment. AC2 also serves as a point of entry for some coronaviruses.
The human version of enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-turning enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalferment located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains the N end of the Peptidas domain M2 and the C end of the transport domain of the renal amino acid collection.
ACE2 is a one-pass membrane protein of type I and its fermentary active domain falls on the surface of cells of lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 non-cell domain is broken off by another enzyme known as a chocolate, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most of the organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most of the alveolar light cell type II, the ENS cells of the thin intestine, the arterial and venous endothelial cells and the smooth muscle cells of most organs.
ACE2 biosynthesis is also found in the cortex of the brain, the striatum, the hypothalamus and the stem of the brain.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE filtrates angiotensin I hormone into the vessel angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, breaks off the carbon dioxide terminal amino acid phenylanin from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into a vasotile angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also fissile a number of other Peptides, including [des-Arg9] - Bradinin, Apelin, Neurotensin, Dinorphine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid SLC6A19 transporter and is present in Hartnup.
As transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (SARS virus); and SAS-COV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, linking the S1 protein with the SARS-CoV and the SAS-CoV2 protein to the fermentary domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and transmission of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosomas inside the cells.
This entrance process also requires S silina protein from the TMPRS2 media, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool. This has led some to think that reducing the levels of ACE2 in cells can help combat infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend the continuation of standard treatment by APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant 34 per cent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group”.
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced for patients with APF inhibitors, who were at higher risk, with pneumonia, especially patients with strokes and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with the reduction of pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than those of patients with overall pneumonia risk.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhaCE2) is thought to be an innovation in therapy in cases of acute lung damage and likely to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in humans with acute respiratory failure caused by lipolysaharids.
The half-life of rahACE2 is about 10 hours for people and 30 minutes for action, in addition to 24 hours for exposure.
Some evidence suggests that rhaACE2 can be a promising tool for people with the intolerance of classical inhibitors of renin angiotensin systems (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases that increase the circulation of angiotensin II. The rhaCE2 introduced was assessed in clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 annexes are mobile phone software designed to assist in epidemiological investigations in the context of the 2019-20 coronary pandemic, i.e. to identify persons (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many annexes have been developed or proposed, formally supported by the authorities.
Several options for communication tracking applications have been developed.
This has led to a discussion of confidentiality issues, particularly with respect to those systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
Softer options include the use of Bluetooth signals to register the proximity of the user to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate the support function of Bluetooth-based applications directly into their operating systems, Android and iOS.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, has launched an application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been associated with people infected by COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and Singapore uses an app called TraceTogether.
The application has been developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted to the Government, and Northern Macedonia has launched the “stopKorona!” application, which works on Bluetooth, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides operational communication with health authorities.
The annex was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the application was waiting to be registered on Google Play Store and Apple App Street.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking annex was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks, and similar applications were planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using the Singapore Annex TraceTogether and the BlueTrace Protocol, and Russia intends to use the Geozoned Annex to ensure that patients with COVID-19 diagnosis living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise from applications, including false responses and potential inefficiencies in the use of the application by only a small part of the population.
In view of concerns about the distribution of misleading or harmful “corners” annexes, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that might propose their coronavirus-related annexes to App Stor, including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Participants in the privacy campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass population surveillance through coronavirus-related annexes; in particular, the question was raised whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronary pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such oversight.
The organizations have announced eight conditions for public projects:
Monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by time-limit clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the dissemination of COVID-19;
The safety and anonymity of data should be protected and evidence of such security should be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
Protection from abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuses;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reports With Out Boards (Reporter ohne Greenzen) also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple propose their joint plan to address the problem of continuous observation, namely, removing the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it becomes necessary.
In some countries, network tracking of locations is used instead of applications, which excludes the need to download the application and avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions, which have access to baseline location data, also have significant potential confidentiality problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of confidentiality systems have been developed that use central servers for communications only (see below).
In South Korea, a system that did not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile devices and card transactions, and then combined them to form notifications in the form of text messages sent to potential infected persons.
The Government not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected persons but also provided information on the location of the public, which was made possible by significant changes in the legislation on the protection of information that had been introduced since the explosion of MERS in the country.
Such information is accessible through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
Monitoring of contacts in which confidentiality is maintained is a well-established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dating from at least 2013; as at 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups were working on confidentiality solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized confidentiality transport (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EveNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the identity data never leave the device and that all comparisons occur on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for maintaining confidentiality in the collection and use of location or cross-road data to track the dissemination of COVID-19.
The platform is based on studies published in March 2020 by the Apps Gon Rogue: Mainining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, another similar project is the SafeTrace Platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware to allow users to exchange confidential data on location and state of health with other users and officials without endangering the confidentiality of the data.
On 5 April 2020, a global coalition of TCN was founded by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols, aimed at reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global compatibility of tracking and warning applications, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official annex.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that monitor Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to monitor contacts, which they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to preserve confidentiality.
They also published the technical specifications of the basic technologies used in the operation of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications to monitor the movement of conauvirus-infected citizens, but with confidentiality of data
In integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve ongoing surveillance problems, first introducing the system through the upgrade of the operating system and then deleting it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
The reprofiling of a drug (also known as re-profiling, re-directing, changing tasks or re-directing drugs) is the re-profiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or a medical condition other than the disease originally prescribed for development.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.
Other research activities include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of reconsensitent plasma.SAR-CoV-2 contains some 66 proteins, each containing several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these connecting sites provides an appropriate basis for the development of an effective anti-virus drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for ATS-CoV-2 are papin-like protease, RNC-dependent polymerase, helicace, S protein and ADF-ribophosphase.
Hussein AA and the co-sponsors, in their pre-school study, examined several candidate compounds that were subsequently optimized and analysed their similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to expedite the development of a high-impact drug against SAS-CoV-2, which would be recommended for clinical research.
Chloroquine is an antimalaria drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be one of the four drugs studied in the “Solidarity” clinical test.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Koumo, announced that the tests of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and phosphate chloroquine sulphate in accordance with the emergency use permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the process of clinical trials of FDA, and was permitted under EUA only as a pilot treatment for emergency care for patients who are hospitalized but unable to receive treatment under clinical test schemes.
CDC stated that “the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of ATS-CoV-2 infection” had not yet been established.
Doctors say they're using drugs when there's no other way out.
The Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine, combined with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
China's clinical trials in Uhan and Shenzhen showed that the pavipriva is “unquestionably effective”.
The 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug received a negative result after an average of four days, while the 45 patients who did not take the drug had 11 days ' duration.
A study was conducted in Uhan to monitor 240 pneumonia patients, one half of whom received a pavipriary and the other half had a umiphenovor.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency has reminded the public that the results of the effectiveness of the drug are scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to replenish its stocks and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sinzo Abe informed the Trump administration of the possibility of purchasing a drug, and the drug may be less effective in the case of the disease.
It can be dangerous for pregnant patients or for patients who try to get pregnant.
One study on the combination of lopinavir and Ritonwir (Kaletra) antivirus drugs concluded that “no effective drug use has been identified”.
Drugs have been developed to inflame HIV reproduction through prosthetic communication.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify medicines to find a connection that will be linked to the SARS-CoV-2 protosis. The scientific community is critical of the reprofiling of drugs that have been designed specifically to treat HIV and AIDS.
WHO has included a combination of Lopinivar and Ritonwire in the international “Solidarity” test.
A remediciter was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola and Marburg virus infections and subsequently found that the remedicer had anti-virus activity in vitro in relation to multiple phylo-, pneumo-, paramixo and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiretroviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that the remdessir can have a high genetic barrier to resistance; several clinical trials are being conducted, including two by Cleveland University clinics; one for patients with a moderate form of disease; and the other for patients with a more severe form.
There are currently three clinical trials for internal introduction of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, the state of New York began testing the antibiotic of azithromycin.
The Japan National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical study by Alvesco (Cyclonesonide) Teijin, an inhalation corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for use in presymptomy patients infected with the new corona virus.
The phase II test, the form of angiotensin fertiliser 2, is conducted with the participation of 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who have been hospitalized with severe forms of disease in order to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of cochicin in reducing inflammation and lung complications among patients with weak COVID-19 symptoms.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 were invited with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding and who do not use effective contraception may not participate in the study.
Several coagulants are on trial in Italy.
The use of low-lying heparin to treat patients has led the Italian Agency for Medicine to publish recommendations on the use of the drug.
On 14 April, a multi-centre study involving 300 patients on the use of sodium enoxaparine in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
Since ATS-CoV-2 was a virus, considerable scientific attention was focused on the reprofiling of approved anti-virus drugs that had been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribaryrin: Fisheries was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the seventh edition of the Chinese recommendations.
Ubiphenover: omiphenover was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the seventh edition of the Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been considered potentially suitable for use as treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilisumub (receptor anti-IL-6): approved in China.
For tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coroner (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been tested, numerous attempts to develop the vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect that a vaccine against the ATS-CoV2 virus could be obtained earlier than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were trained in Phase I security studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, resulting in significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against ATS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI Vaccine Development Initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, 10 different technology platforms were under development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in Phase I security studies:
Nucleinic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate drug: Moderna, IRN-1273)
A virus vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them being used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milcan Institute), and 37 additional candidate vaccines have been declared, but little public information is available (suspected as planning or development).
Phases I to II are pretested for safety and immunity, usually randomized, placebo controlled and several sites with more precise and effective doses at the same time.
Phase III of the test usually covers more participants, including the control group; during this stage, the drugs are tested for disease prevention efficiency while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Out of 79 active-development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet undergone human testing (still in the pre-clinic stage).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clammy vaccine that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, launched work on its own vaccine with the aim of starting human testing in 2021.
Vaccine projects were also launched at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, the pharmaceutical companies Jansen, led by Hanneka Schuithmeyker, announced the start of work on the development of their vaccine.
Jansen is working with his biotechnology partner Vaxart to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a productive partnership with the Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine on technology similar to that used to vaccate neo-antigen cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the Research Institute announced the completion of the production of the vaccine and the start of the tests.
On 27 February 2020, the subsidiary company Generex, Nu Generex Immuno-Oncology, announced that a project to develop the Ii-Key Peptid Vaccine against COVID19 was beginning.
Their aim was to develop a vaccine candidate drug that could be tested in public in 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Command for Medical Research and Logistics, Fort Dietrick, and the Walter Reid, Silver Spring, of the United States Army, which is located in western Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that she had entered into a partnership with Notavax Inc.
To develop and produce a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for pre-clinical tests and clinical trials of phase I by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that even accelerated vaccine development would take at least one and a half to two years.
On 12 March 2020, the Medicalago, a biotechnology company, Quebec, reported that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they had created a particle similar to a coronavirus.
A potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory research and human testing is planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed a “great sum of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which was objected to by the Government of Germany.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfier announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on IRN.
BNT162 is a candidate for RNA vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing pre-clinical tests and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that in April 2020, it would receive the results of pre-clinic tests, and their final vaccine candidate drug could begin testing people in the autumn.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced an investment of $4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine consortium with the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Modernna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-implifying RNA vaccin from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving consistency from China.
In late March, the Canadian Government announced $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate drugs in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicalago and Saskatchewan University initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of $192 million specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for a national vaccine bank, which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronary outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported on the testing of PittCoVac, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, stating that “MNA introduced sub-unitary SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong responses from antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] that occurred two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of Waterloo University announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be produced in the form of a nasal scaffold.
The DNA bacteria will reproduce inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SAS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three U.S. universities combined the resources of IBM supercomputers with those of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages beyond those of disease prevention.
Another randomized study conducted in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines developed may prove to be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies to assess the effectiveness of animal-based vaccines, which are characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, point to the need to contain infection levels 3 in the handling of live viruses and to coordinate internationally to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against ATS and MINS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines that are safe and effective for people.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of austere pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world, and there is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to be distributed, it was thought that the study of ATS at that time could become a standard for the development of vaccines and treatments against the infection of MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) vaccine from MERS that had undergone phase I of human clinical trials, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines and were under development, two of which were adnoviral (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one of which was MVA-Vectoral (MVA-MERS-S).
The theory of conspiracy spread on social networks, claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all, and that a vaccine from it already existed.
Publications on social media quoted some patients who claimed patents for genetic sequences of other strains of coronary strains, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronaurus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) that is communicable from severe acute coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulties.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of ovation, and stomach pain.
The time range from first symptoms to peaks is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are limited to mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease is transmitted to viral pneumonia and polyorganic deficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people were killed.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, and the virus is mainly spread when people are in close contact with one another, often through microscopic drops that are released into the air by coughing, teacups, or conversation.
Although these droplets are formed by exhalation, they usually pose a threat by falling to the ground or on the surface but are not transmitted through the air at long distances.
People are also infected by touching a contaminated surface, followed by their eyes, noses, or mouths.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it may be possible to spread it both before symptoms appear and in later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymerase chain reaction with a reverse transpiracy in real time (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nasal brush.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients suspected of being ill and for those taking care of them.
Recommendations on the use of medical masks vary from one population to another: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
The local prevalence of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may not have symptoms or flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and rest.
Emergency symptoms include difficult breathing, permanent pain or chest depression, confused consciousness, waking difficulties, a bruised face or lips; if the symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought without delay.
The symptoms of upper respiratory tracts, such as snorkeling, snout, or throat pain, may be less common.
Also, there are different percentages of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Some of the cases reported in China were initially only a feeling of chest depression and heart rate.
In some cases, the disease can progress through pneumonia and polyorganic deficiency, resulting in death.
It's called the incubation period.
The incubation period COVID-19 shall normally be five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5 per cent of people, the symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days of infection, according to available data, not all people are infected with the symptoms.
The role of such symptomous media in transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that it can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The percentage of infected people with an unsymptopic disease is currently unknown and is only being studied; the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the virus were unsymptopic.
The National Health Commission of China has begun to include unsymptomized cases in its daily report since 1 April; of the 166 cases recorded on that day, 130 (78 per cent) were rejected at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
The loudness of the speech makes more of a drop in the air than the sound of a normal volume.
A study in Singapore showed that a cough can extend up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) in the open cough.
The virus is not usually transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the bioaerosol transfer of the particles of the virus is still possible, and air testing by air collectors in corridors outside human rooms has shown that there is a virus RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (SLR), may lead to the spraying of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus can spread through fecals, but it is considered to be a low risk; the virus is the most dysfunctional virus when people show symptoms; it is possible to spread the virus before symptoms appear, but it is not.
The staff of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that it is not yet fully clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 others, and that the virus can survive on the surface from a few hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface, the virus could live for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days and 99% of copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These indicators, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergents, when properly used, have a useful impact on the control of infection: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus by deactivating it and can also remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconychloride and chlorhexide glucose (a surgical disinfectant), were less effective against this virus, and in a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
Five out of six patients had the highest blood concentration, and the sixth patient had the highest blood concentration on the second day.
The severe acute coronaviral syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new acute coronaviral respiratory syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases reported in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SAS-CoV-2 virus are also found in nature-related coronaviruses.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens up its protective shell.
The light is the organ most exposed to COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells through the angiotensin turning enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in the alveolar cells of the lung type II.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell by means of a characteristic surface glycoprotein, a “chipa” (peplomer).
In 12 per cent of the infected people admitted to the hospital in Uhana, severe myocardial injuries were diagnosed, which are more common in severe forms of disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and the immune system violations observed during the progression of the disease, but the severe damage to the myocardium may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are in large quantities in the heart as they participate in the work of this body.
The high frequency of trombozzes (31%) and venous tromboembola (25%) was observed in patients with COVID-19 and may indicate adverse projections. Autopia of patients who died from COVID-19 showed disinfectant alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocytes of inflammatory inflammatory inhalants in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropic to ACE2-express epithetic cells in the respiratory tract, patients with heavy COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperplasm.
In particular, it was found that the GM-CCF T-cells corresponded to the re-reclamation of inflammable IL-6 monocites and the heavy lung pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Limphocytic infyltrates were also detected at the opening.
WHO has also published several test protocols for this disease.
The field chain response in real time (RT-PPC) is a standard test method.
The test shall normally be carried out on respiratory samples derived from the nosoil sac, but may also be used on the nose or sputum sample.
The results are usually available for a period of several hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two samples of blood taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are not of direct importance.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify the strain of the coronary and publish its genetic sequence, so that laboratory scientists around the world can develop their own polymerase chain reaction tests (PCRs) to detect the presence of the virus.
As at 4 April 2020, tests on antibodies that could detect infection at present, as well as possible contamination in the past, were under development but were not yet widespread.
The Chinese experience with the results of the tests showed that they were only 60 to 70 per cent accurate.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Authority (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, authorizing its application at the end of this month, and the diagnosis instructions issued by Zhongnan Uhan University Hospital indicate how to detect infection on the basis of clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
The two-way multi-year sub-plenary compaction of the “mat glass” type, with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposteur distribution, are frequent symptoms identified at the early stage of the disease.
Sub-plenary domination, symptoms of a coursing bridge (long-stretching of an alveolar-filled partition) and consolidation are evolving as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic injuries and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
Main results of the pathological study carried out at the opening:
Macroscopy: Pleuritity, pericarditis, sealing and femurs
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
lung cells, hyperplasia of pneumocells, large atomic pneumocells, inter-flammatory inflammation with lymphocytic inflammation and the formation of multinuclear giant cells
Heavy form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory diress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Residual pneumonia: organization of exudats in alveolar floors and lung interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Difficult internal retardation (DAF syndrome); leukaeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying in the home, avoiding human locations, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene and avoiding touch with eyes, nose or mouth.
CDC recommends that a mouth and nose be covered with a napkin or a teacup or, in the absence of a napkin, cover the mouth and nose of the inner side of the elbow zone of the hand.
After coughing or snorkeling, it is recommended that a high-quality hand hygiene procedure be carried out.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of fabric masks in public places, in particular in order to limit the transmission of infection to persons with unsymptoms of disease; social distance strategies aim at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have resulted in the closure of schools and enterprises, limited movement of citizens and the cancellation of major public activities.
Distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no proven effectiveness drug against COVID-19, since the completion of the vaccine is not expected before 2021, the major part of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as Plateau.
CDC also recommends washing hands with soap and water more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or with severe hand contamination, and before eating and after shrivelling, coughing or sneeze.
CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant (at least 60 per cent alcohol content) hand-processing device, but only when soap and water are not available. Where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two recipes for local production.
These compositions use ethanol or isopropanol with anti-microbial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to solve bacterial alcohol spores and is not a suitable tool for antiseptic hand processing.
The glycerol is added as a wetting agent.
Patients are shown supporting therapy, which may include infuse therapy, oxygen support and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that they are infected with the virus wear a common medical mask.
Extra-corporal membrane oxidization (ECMO) was used to address respiratory deficiency, but its benefits are still being explored.
In order to strengthen immunity, personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diets are recommended.
Supportive treatment can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease, WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive therapy and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions on a free resource — IBCC.
As of April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
In order to treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health workers recommend choosing paracetamol (accetamine) as compared to ibuprophen.
In carrying out procedures in which the air- and-air release may occur, such as injection or hand drying, precautionary measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in health facilities.
The CDC recommends that health care providers from COVID-19 be placed in air-cupal (AIR) facilities, an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. The CDC published recommendations for the use of personal protection devices (ISIS) during the pandemic.
Personal protective equipment recommended: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
Respirators N95 have been approved for industrial use, but FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the emergency use permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but for use without instruction, the effectiveness of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of protective front screens or, at most, the production of masks in their own home conditions.
In most cases, COVID-19 is not very heavy enough to require artificial ventilation of or alternatives to lungs, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for patients with respiratory deficiency related to COVID-19 is under active consideration and there are some indications that injections can be avoided by means of an obsolescence oxygen roll with intense air flow or two levels of positive air pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods are as effective for patients in critical condition as the IWL.
Some doctors choose in favour of invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs when available, since this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared with the high-air flow bow rolls. The risk of severe disease for older persons (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, hospital beds per capita are scarce, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in the incidence of hard-form COVID-19 infections that require hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation, and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of artificial ventilating the lungs is complicated, as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops under COVID-19, and oxygenation is increasingly problematic.
The inhalation IWL and EVC are necessary to deliver a maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure the minimum damage to them by ventilation, which may result in the development of the pneumothorax.
In earlier fan models, high VETs may not be available.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are currently under clinical testing.
The most promising is the remedessir.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of disease.
The volunteers recommended by WHO participate in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatment techniques. FDA has granted temporary permission to use reconsensitent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the life of a person is at serious or immediate risk.
Its use has not been subjected to clinical research to prove the safety and effectiveness of treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to combat the outbreak of disease.
For entry, users must enter their name and identification number.
The annex may detect “near contact” by means of surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
When potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends self-insulating, but also provides notification to local health authorities; large-scale data analysis collected from mobile phones, identification technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to monitor data on mobile phones of people suspected of being infected by the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to provide quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, the Federal Government Institutions of Germany and Robert Koh Institute have been able to provide aggregate data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, quarantine detection technology has been introduced to detect quarantine violators.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, explained that cellular network operators reported that “40 per cent of people continue to move within the territory”.
The Government of Germany had held a 48-hour marathon of weekend programming, which had been attended by more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersty Kalulid, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronary.
People may be under stress because of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Enhancing social isolation, loneliness, health, stress and economic recession are ideal conditions for harming the mental health and well-being of people”.
The disease can occur in light form with minor or missing symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Patients with a mild form of disease are usually cured within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may need between three and six weeks to be treated.
Women who are pregnant may be at higher risk of obtaining a heavy form of COVID-19 based on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although the COVID-19 data are not available.
For those with the most severe cycle of COVID-19, rapid progress may be made in acute respiratory distillation syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory deficiency, septic shock or polyorganic deficiency.
The complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, anomalous trombo education, as well as heart, kidney and liver problems.
Trombo-education abnormalities, especially the increase in protrombone time, were described in 6 per cent of patients admitted to the COVID-19 hospital, while 4 per cent of those patients were affected by kidney function.
About 20 to 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have developed liver enzymes (transmitters).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and deaths was ten days, of which five were in hospitalization.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to intensive care was seven days.
Studies on early-stage diseases show that the average time from the initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 per cent and for women 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of postmortem samples indicate a diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromixoid exsids in both lungs.
The pneumocells have seen viral cytopathic changes.
The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory ditress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8 per cent of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were related to raising the level of troponin or heart arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had prior health problems, and the availability of health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also have an impact on mortality.
Death estimates vary according to condition due to such regional differences, as well as methodological difficulties.
Inefficient calculation of light-shaped cases may lead to overestimation of mortality.
Nevertheless, the fact that deaths occur as a result of past diseases may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smoking users developed a total of 1.4 times more severe symptoms of COVID-19 and such patients were approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die than non-smokers, and concerns were expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
A Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who had recovered from the disease had experienced a drop of between 20 and 30 per cent in their lungs, and that their scans had revealed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to “After intensive therapy”.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether the patients who had recovered from the virus had permanent immunity against them.
According to other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but it has also been reported that after recovery from COVID-19 the coronavirus tests were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an increase in the length of the disease rather than a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural, animal-based and infectious.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the virus was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, refers to 1 December 2019 as the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary from region to region and time, and are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatments used, the timing of the outbreak of the disease and the characteristics of the population, such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency codes for ICD-10: U07.1 for deaths due to laboratoryly confirmed infections SAS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths due to clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of the infection SAS-CoV-2. The ratio of deaths to infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a certain period of time.
According to statistics from Johns Hawkings University, the global number of deaths and infections as at 17 April 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2 240).
This figure varies from region to region; some other methods include the definition of a death rate due to disease (CFR), which reflects the rate of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, as well as the determination of a death rate resulting from the transmitted infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of a certain population from the time of infection until the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced by all patients who have been infected, the presence of such antibodies may indicate how many people have been infected.
At an epicenter of outbreaks in Italy, Castillo d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 persons (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease was spread during the celebrations to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies based on donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (00.04 per cent of the population).
The impact of pandemics and mortality rates varies between men and women.
According to research conducted in China and Italy, mortality rates are higher among men.
The group of the highest risk is men over 50 years of age; the gender gap is narrowed only from the age of 90.
China had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioural.
Gender-based immunological differences, the lower prevalence of smoking among women associated with men (e.g. hypertension among men at a younger age than in women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of those infected were men, and 72 per cent of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government did not maintain gender statistics for COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and ORVI have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are more likely to become infected, respectively.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Thatros Adan Guebrius, explains: “CO” means “Korona”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease”, and the 19th year when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international recommendations on name aimed at preventing stigma; the virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronaviral respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
In public communications, WHO uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus”.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the Coronary virus.
During the initial outbreak in Uhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the “Koronaviar” and the “Konak coronavirus”.
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “survey respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCov” as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, the official titles “COVID-19” and “SARS-COV-2” were published.
Due to restrictions on the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials, such as nasal sacs, as well as the parts of the IWL apparatus.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame, while one of the local productions was re-profiled and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
With the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, disinformation and fair information on the origin of the virus, its scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the Internet began to spread at a high speed.
Likely, humans can become infected with other animals.
Research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine for virus or drug treatment.
Various international research on vaccines and medicines from COVID-19 is under way by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY Test) programme, which aims at assessing the therapeutic effects of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is not yet a vaccine available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidate drugs.
Both SAS-CoV and SAS-CoV-2 enter human cells with an ACE2 receptor, so scientific research uses the results of previous studies conducted on SAS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to develop a whole-of-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause rapid immune response by the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a sub-unit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that increases the immune system's sensitivity to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SAS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S - schi-like protein that helps the virus penetrate the receptor of the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is to develop vaccines based on nucleinic acid (DNA or RNA vaccin, a new vaccine method).
Pilot vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, Seattle began its first clinical trial of the vaccine at four volunteers.
Vaccines contain a harmless genetic code, copied from the virus causing the disease, and anti-téthelossive retardation has been identified as a potential problem in the development of vaccines from SAS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests were being carried out.
The drugs approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven tests, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The re-profiling of anti-virus drugs is a major part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine studies of phase III on remedessir had been carried out in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate preparations for COVID-19 was carried out, and several other existing antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment were also being considered, including remedesir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, Lopinaviar / Ritonaviar, and Lopinaviar / Ritonavary, combined with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the efficiency of the use of the remedessir.
A clinical improvement was observed in patients who received a remethic as an exception.
The phase III of clinical trials is already under way in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used for malaria treatment has been reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Uhan Institute of Virusology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling the dose is very dangerous and can lead to fatal deaths.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued a permit for emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese instructions of the seventh edition also indicate interferon, fisherin or ubiphenol as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of fish are necessary to inhibit ATS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for detailed study in vivo by showing the inflammation of ATS-CoV-2 at low concentrations, and studies showed that SARS-CoV-2, through interaction with the ACE2 receptor, requires the use of transmembrane protein sulphur 2 (TMPRSS2).
Research into the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without an azithromycin has significant limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study.
Hypercyctokinemia may occur as a complications in the late stages of the heavy form COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercyctokinemia; as a result of a small study by the National Health Commission of China, the recommendation for the treatment of the coronary has been included in the tocilismub.
The drug has been released into two stages of unremunerated testing, which is conducted at the national level in Italy, after positive results have been obtained from the use of the drug among patients with a severe disease.
In combination with a blood serum analysis on ferritin to detect cytocin storms, it is intended to counter factors that are believed to cause death for some patients.
In 2017, FDA was approved by an antagonist for interlecin-6 receptor, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refracter cytokines steroid syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there has been no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilismub is an effective treatment for cytokines syndrome.
The transfer of treated and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to those in need is now seen as a non-vaccinic method of passive immunization.
The strategy has been tested in the treatment of SARS patients, but its results have not been convincing.
The neutralization of the virus is the expected effect that passive antibody therapy can provide protection against ATS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as anti-teletoxic cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may also be used.
Other forms of passive treatment by antibodies, e.g. monochloric antibodies, are under development.
The use of recontinuous blood serum, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of cured patients and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.
Coronary diseases, high-level group of syndromes
Lee Wenljan, a doctor at Uhana Central Clinic, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
