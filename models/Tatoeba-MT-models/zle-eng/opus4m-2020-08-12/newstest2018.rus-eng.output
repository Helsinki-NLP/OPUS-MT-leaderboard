The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has signed a law on administrative liability for breach of the time and procedure for payment of goods (work, services) in the conduct of procurement for State and municipal needs.
This law is intended to address the very acute problem of non-compliance by employers in public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs could not receive payment under existing government and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Office of the Attorney-General of the Russian Federation to take special control of the problem.
Because the businessmen themselves were unable to deal with unfair employers who entered into unfunded contracts, tried to avoid the obligations they had entered into and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has submitted 9,700 submissions, as a result of which 4,500 officials have been brought to disciplinary proceedings, and 533 administrative officers have submitted 75 submissions to the investigative authorities for the conduct of investigations, and 46 of them have been prosecuted.
As a result, over 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
These huge amounts have not been accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion-dollar contracts.
Many, systematic delays in the payment of business services to much more modest amounts have led to word-of-word debt.
Here's a special case.
The head of the small company won a competition for social transport services for several million roubles.
A person has invested all his working funds, has fully complied with his obligations, but has not received the money in time.
The result is a growing financial coma of arrears in salaries, taxes, and loans that would have led to bankruptcy had the enterprise not sought the assistance of the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
A number of regions have now been able to minimize the problem.
However, by the first half of the year 2017, the total debt of State and municipal contracts identified by prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt rates continue to reach critical levels, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office operates under a manual crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally holds visiting meetings with local authorities, at which all violations revealed by prosecutors and measures to address them immediately are dealt with.
Such operational meetings have already been held this year in Yaroslav and Ekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ “On the amendment of the Code of Administrative Offences to establish the administrative liability of the employer's officials for breach of the time and procedure for payment of goods (work, services) in the conduct of the procurement for State and municipal needs” will improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Office of the Attorney-General.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with an article which provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for breach by an official of the employer of the time and procedure for payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he or she will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative innovations in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Unit announced a warning of movement to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Populations has issued a warning to colour travelers in Missouri due to discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: “A warning to travelers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Populations, effective before 28 August 2017, calls upon African American travellers, visitors and citizens of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to exercise greater caution in their travels to the state in connection with a number of questionable racist incidents recently occurring throughout the state and in the presence of here”.
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Populations, the newly adopted Missouri law led to the announcement of a mobility warning, which made it more difficult for people to win claims of discrimination, as well as the fact that State law enforcement agencies have disproportionately chosen minorities as their targets.
“You have human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin color, beaten and killed,” said the Canzas City Star, by Rod Chepel, President of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored People of Missouri.
“We hear complaints more than ever before.”
This is the first such warning announced by the organization in relation to the U.S. state.
The Group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas during his trip to the state, and the Missouri State Police arrested him without charge of a crime.
The warning also mentions the recent report of the Missouri State Attorney General that the likelihood of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for whites.
“The aim is to alert people to the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” said Chepel.
“People have to be prepared to take the money with them for bail or to inform their relatives that they are travelling in state territory.”
According to the latest data from the FBI ' s hate crimes programme, 100 hate crimes were reported in Missouri in 2015, making the State ' s 16th largest number of such violations.
The warning of movement was also a response to the new Missouri State law, which would make it more difficult to bring a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Earlier, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Freedoms (ACLU) had issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona after these states had enacted new immigration control laws ordering local law enforcement agencies to arrest persons for violations of immigration laws, which ACCLU considered should have increased racially based inspections.
Warnings on movement are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but more recently, public organizations have responded to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed by shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
The unknown fired a police patrol in the Egyptian town of Isna, reporting Reuters with reference to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
Two people, including one police officer, were killed and three were injured during the shooting.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the vehicle, and two armed men in the car opened fire on the law enforcement personnel.
One of the perpetrators has been arrested, the other has managed to escape.
Rusturism supports the law on the abolition of free luggage for non-returnable air tickets
The head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview with the RBC television channel that “positively” refers to the adoption of a law abolishing the free transportation of luggage on non-return flights.
"You have to create conditions under which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than one who has luggage," he said.
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that despite the fears of the citizens, there would be no need to pay for the transportation of upper clothes and mobile phones in the hand-held.
“It would be proper to calm down all our citizens and tourists and to say it, to say that it is to outer garments, umbrellas, mobile phones, iPad or even a computer,” said the head of Rostourism.
Formerly, Russian President Vladimir Putin had signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule of free transportation of luggage on a non-returnable plane ticket.
It is that airlines can determine for themselves the number and weight of the luggage included in the non-return tariff.
Vladimir Putin commissioned the elimination of the pollution of Baikal
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at the Baikal Protection Meeting, reported that in recent years significant areas of the lake had been severely polluted.
It mandated the identification of sources of funding, plans and actors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin has also commissioned a full rehabilitation of contaminated areas.
“It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, most of them are worn out,” quotes the President's RIA News.
He also added that the Office of the Procurator-General of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with natural landfills and a number of environmental irregularities by rest-organizers.
"I want to emphasize this: not everyone checks in a row, but the measure needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and appropriate measures to be taken," he stressed.
In the past, the Office of the Attorney-General had reported a decline in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of environmentally controlled sites.
We will recall that, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in a direct line, stated the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special security regime.
He was informed of economic problems by the residents of the island of Olhoon, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory.
The Head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donski, immediately proposed a solution to the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal Water Area, but in the Government of Buryatia, it was recalled that such a change was not sufficient, as restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
In the past, the Ministry of Economy had proposed a solution to the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A new temple will be established in South.
In the village of Sosová, members of the North ' s small indigenous community, Rakhtinya, together with the inhabitants of the Berezov district, are involved in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honor of Clergyman Nicholas the Miracle.
Its location is a riverbank, and the temple will be visible from afar, so it will serve as a guide lighthouse for fishermen.
According to the community, the construction work will be completed this year, the domes are now installed and the church bells are available.
The IGR of the fleet provided escorts.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Miracle Worker because he is honored by the Orthodox Church as the patron of travelers, including fishermen.
At the same time, fishing gives settlers work, feeding them.
Locals wait for the temple to open its doors and even write children about it as a local attraction in school.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why does Singapore obey laws?
I'm talking to a local businessman named Chang, sitting in a restaurant in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while he carefully stores the cigarettes in the iron box he has taken from his office.
After the interview is over, the businessman goes to the nearest urn -- a hundred meters -- and throws the bulls out there.
A fine for garbage in a public place is 500 local dollars, says Chang.
You know, since I was a kid, I've just had a reflex. You can't throw a phantom on the bridge, you can't throw a phantom on the bridge.
And now it's all over the camera.
Indeed, Singapore’s pavements in the center of the city are as clean as a museum.
Chang says three months ago his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted a graphite wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the boy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to corruption.
What?
Imagine.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on the berries and spent a week in prison.
We don't have much body punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and unerringly severe laws, the AIF observer was on the spot.
There's no intention here to abolish the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long given up on the views of both the European Union and the United States on this.
If a person drives a large shipment of drugs or trades in them, he is placed as a hangman.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian national was detained at Changi airport carrying 400 g of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister spoke in his defense, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
But the guy was hanged anyway.
Since then, drug dealers have made a thorough journey around our country.
The point is that Singapore has a duty to observe everything in a row, not just the modest and the poor.
It doesn't matter who you are, you're a millionaire, you're a vice-premier, you're a famous artist or a European Union resident.
There's one option: if you find a pound of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you're walking through Singapore and you meet a bunch of warnings everywhere, you're just being surprised at how many bans there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing rubber is only sold in pharmacies and can be purchased strictly by a doctor’s prescription (!).
A tourist will not be taken away from the gum when he arrives, but it is worth putting a "slice" in the subway, giving him a fine of 1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white tablets on their neck, "I was trashing."
In addition to fines, unscathed urns are often sentenced to a “thorn in the palaces” for a week to clean up parks and beaches.
A “criminal” who forgets to wash the water in a public toilet pays 6,000 roubles, while a special detector works in an effort to alleviate a minor need for an elevator in a residential home, locks doors and sends a signal to the police.
Among the most exotic laws are the prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs, and even excessive flooding of room plants (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry incendiary lighters, otherwise fined 5,000 Singaporean bucks.
In general, the thought is, no matter how hard you try, you're bound to break something.
It's not like that, but it's trying to test me with Muhammad Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of the local travel.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years, I haven't seen anyone get involved for their violation.
Why do they stay?
Don't let the citizens relax.
Compliance with basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let's say that if a minor is sold in a basket of cigarettes, he'll be punished in the chain: the store owner will pay a huge sum, the breaker himself will be hit with sticks at the back, and the seller will also be thrown out and put in jail.
It is because of such harsh laws that offences are rare in Singapore.
Is this justified?
As early as the 1970 ’ s, we had chaos on our roads, and motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wished, and got drunk driving.
After the fines were imposed in one year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having a drink of whiskey, knows that if they stop, the police will not be released for a bribe, fined the value of the apartment, and sent to jail for years.
To many foreigners, a city-state in South-East Asia appears to be a type of concentration camp.
In 1993, U.S. writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" -- a U.S. visitor had the horror of the universal wealth of the inhabitants, the “terrorous clean airport” and the “cultural nature”.
Deciphering, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and that's not supposed to be true in principle.
For the first days in Singapore, and you're afraid to throw a paper on the sidewalk, you'll get caught when you get in the subway with the ice cream.
But then you go to the little India area, and then suddenly, the template is broken, and the bus stop is full of plastic glasses.
"What's that?" You wonder.
That's it, the Singaporeans are smiling.
Everything happens.
Not every crime like this will be seized in its place, but you must know that if you are counted, you will not be wronged. You have transgressed the law.
Most of all, it's enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam, I moved very carefully -- motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty bums and beggars.
In our streets too, not everyone tries to throw trash into urns.
Singapore, however, has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on earth through the use of dragon fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
This is human nature: remember, and no one in Russia has been driving until they've been fined.
Although Singapore does not have fines, it is voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we should think that in Russia, too, people would be happy with the clean streets, the lack of garbage on the subway and welcome the arrest of those who are confusing the elevator with the public toilet.
Here's the corporal punishment. Thank you.
In the rest of Singapore’s laws, however, are at least worth looking into.
Nothing holy?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting statues.
Americans understand this no less than the rest of us - the deliberate theater demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein in the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Trump Government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought a symbolic ax on the Statue of Liberty during a violent dispute with CNN journalist Jim Akosta about President's proposals to dramatically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue itself.
The multitude of owners of pleasureships and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would have lynched him if he had tried to do so.
But he tried to understand her, and especially what she was assigned to do in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when Emma Lazarous’s poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller screamed at Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that enshrines the world.
The formation you are talking about was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller correctly explained the facts, but as he said, it's not really about history.
It's about the present rise of the amazing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, your crowds who dream of breathing freely"
Never before have "unfortunate waste" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature -- he made it clear that in America, the Trump of these people isn't waiting.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a debate about the meaning of America.
Lazarus, and her friends, who fought to place her words on the ceiling of the statue after her death, understood very well that they were committing a totally political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the link between the French and the American republics by means of a banal classic figure, the female image of Liberty.
Lazarous changed her meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she was given a totally different name: Mother of Escaped.
The combination of poems and images was a brilliant feminist movement and a devastating attack against American Nazism.
And how Lazarous changed the meaning of the statue, right though he was going to change it back.
In 2010, Rush Limbo, who was like John the Baptizer, who was preaching the arrival of Trump, thought that Freedom was not inviting anyone; rather, it was an early neoconservator bearing the flame of America lying in the darkness of the world: " Freedom is moving forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch isn't needed to light the way to the U.S.."
It was against Limbo's custom that really got to the point.
The purpose of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would have been seen by the exhausted, unhappy but full of hope on the decks of the ship after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue answers them with the words of hope and the hospitality they wish to hear.
And, of course, that's not the prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch is needed not to light the way, but to inflame hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
World Championship 2017: Neil Blake commends Scottish members of the assembled British.
Elijah Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scotsmen in Britain.
Neil Blake, director of the game of the British Federation of Light Athletics, said that the 16-person Scottish part of the World Championship would make “a significant contribution to the team's game”.
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected at the London Championship of 2017, beginning on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland “something special is being created” and the Federation of Easy Athletics of the United Kingdom should take this into account.
'We know it and we're trying to understand it and support it while they have the potential,' said Blake.
"I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's related to what they've done.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics thinks that what they've done needs to be worked.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: what they did must work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why things are so great, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some of the Scottish athletes are competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres; and Elid Doyle chose her captain.
"Alid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"Many athletes, whether Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, have come out of this room, feeling proud and determined to win.
The passions and sincere feelings Alyde had in her were excellent."
The owner of the Commonwealth Silver Medal, who, at his fifth World Cup, would run a distance of 400 metres with obstacles, said that 16 Scottishs in a British prefabricated championship were "unbelievable".
The previous record of Scottishs at the World Championship was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Lora Muir, a middle-end runner, was heading ahead and had beaten five British and two European records last year.
She'll run 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Har, who's going to run for 1500 meters, is another Scotsman who deserves attention: behind his back is a good season in which the winners of the British prefabricated competitions and the annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first world championship, when she was the only Scottish on her team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says she's "unbelievablely proud" that so many of her compatriots not only entered the collective, but in some cases they will claim medals and fight for the final.
"The team's capital is chosen by other members of the team, so it was an honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen -- it's a very special thing to me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottishs who have entered the assembly.
This shows how much we have done.
And they are all a few of them who are seeking to reach the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I just noticed that we were lucky enough to take home the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of what we're going to be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I've got another chance to go to his arena and participate in the competitions, and the atmosphere will be great."
Frictioning critics on Facebook: You don't have to go to the public if you're not ready to listen to the voter criticism.
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from critical of everything from domestic politics to its political principles.
His criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "we, the deaf and the dumb, can be taken away as sheep for slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subjects blocked and wiped out the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his Facebook official page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subjects called this action null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to Hogan-like guy.
He's an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
He's the second highest in the approval rating among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionor.
He showed a firm hand in state management and commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as a primary means of communicating with his voters and of jokingly showing his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
It is therefore unnecessary and ultimately harmful to block people coming to the governor's page - which is declared to be an official public forum and is being held by officials of the administration for the money of taxpayers.
In an interview with Washington Post, the Spokesperson, Amelia Ches, defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was simply a modernization of comments.
But it's too easy to use the images of trolls, spams, and gamers on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are the real people, not trolls, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and non-breathing.
The pastor quoted the Bible as appealing that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Romana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the section of her comments to the post article.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, some people immediately say that it's a so-called glove rather than admitting they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call a “concentrated spam-attack”, others would probably call a “active life-position”.
In the Facebook era, it is easy to change your image simply by blocking critics or erase negative comments.
It's much less drinking work than it used to be when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical fronts, or arresting and closing the mouth of protestors.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, only in the number.
Hogan is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media networks.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been dropped off his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this topic was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. district judge from Alexandria, James K. Kacheris, the president of the county supervisory council of Laudon County violated the First Amendment by beating the voter in his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin filed complaints with the American Civil Liberties Alliance for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
It must not be that hard.
In Washington, D.C., a period of affordable postal spending was about the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers has quadrupled and anonymous letters have severely undermined its credibility.
Even then, Washington dealt with anonymous trolls.
People named Juricola, Valerius, Belize and Porcius wrote letters to newspapers deriding Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington's online document project, his office was overwhelmed by petitions critical of his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech is at the very heart of our State.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty looks forward to a home at the Renaissance Club.
The former European champion, Ronan Rafferty, looks forward to a domestic convenience for the next three days, when the Renaissance Club in East Lotian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
A Northern Irish man who led the neighborhood at Archerfield Links and moved towards the final round last year, until he lost Paul Ilsa, is attached to a new seat and serves as the representative of the tournament on behalf of Jerry Sarwady, founder and director of the Club.
“I have seen the Renaissance Club being built, and we are seeing it succeed with this event,” said Rafferty.
“The players will see this field at his best moment, it is in excellent condition.
Jerry did a great job setting this place up.
He's a strong supporter of this game and he's proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils looks forward to the opportunity to defend championship for the first time, despite the fact that his 32-year career won both the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour.
"It's really a special feeling," said a Southport player.
"I couldn't try to win Extramadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule one year after I won it.
It's magic to go back to this corner of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon was a very special impression to win last year.
It was indeed a special time, and we will always remember it.”
Returning to the battle on Gary Orr's native land, he joined the European Senior Sports Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year.
The event will be its first public appearance in Scotland during the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"When you play at home, it's always a bit more important," said a resident of Helensborough Orr.
"You want to speak well, but you feel this extra burden."
I'm very happy to play again, and I've shown you a good golf.
I am pleased with the way things are being done so far.”
The former winner of the "Masters" tournament, Ian Wesnem, and the champion championships of senior athletes, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalty, will join this trio.
Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scottishs on the field; the others are Andrew OldCorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmur and Ross Drummond.
Participation in a tournament for free, and parking costs £5 per hour if there's one person in the car, and £10 if there's two or more.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn how to absorb harmful emissions
Car tunnels capable of absorbing carbon dioxide emitted by vehicles are already being tested on British roads.
The country's transport agency reported positive results from a 100-metre tunnel on a road in the north of the country, according to Autocar.
The tunnel, which is 6 metres high, is made up of some new polymer materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in the vehicle exhausts.
However, the establishment of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the major measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charge stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of activities to reduce road traffic, increase the use of commercial electricity and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgord changed the punishment of disabled Mamaev to a fine
Mosgarud changed the sentence of four and a half years ' imprisonment to 200,000 roubles for a disabled person.
TASS reports on this.
The Public Prosecutor's Office had previously asked the court to replace the term by conditional, explaining its request that Mamaev's disease “impeds him to prison conditions”.
Anton Mamaev, 28 years old, was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment, serving a sentence in a general regime prison for a robbery committed by a former Special Forces fighter.
On 19 July, the court released the man from custody at a retreat in SIZO.
Poverty and death in Indonesian “gold land”
Bardin Dehei doesn't use the stove in preparation for lunch.
She doesn't even use a potion.
In her wooden home in Enarotal, the capital of Paniai County in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply puts sweet potatoes, which is here called the note, right into the house.
After half an hour, the charred tubers are obtained and eaten by impatient, unwashed hands.
Deheii sits on the ground floor - she doesn't have furniture - and it's where she does her housework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of four wives of her husband, so she's not assigned to work in the field.
There's a lot of life here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous — many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and some are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk through the village after five o'clock," she said.
This is a rare opportunity to see daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which joined Indonesia in 1969, following a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The existing movement of independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintains strong control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and West Papua, and Papua New Guinea ' s independent State occupied the eastern part of the island.
The Enarotals are as remote as the abandoned city; the road here includes an 18 - hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative center, to Nabir, and then a five - hour shake on a hired car.
There's no public transport here.
A city of about 19,000 people is made up of wooden houses covered with bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of red - colored shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of them.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the papas were worshiping a god named Uha Tame.
There were other changes.
“ We used to wear these clothes,” says Dehei, pointing to his bright, handcuffed turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population lives below the poverty line, and infant mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The largest gold mine in the world and the most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Panai, a highland province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freport obtained gold and copper at about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can boast of a 78 billion dollars worth of forest.
These assets, however, have led to one disaster for the popes, ensuring that the powerful Indonesian armed forces maintain their suffocating presence.
According to an investigation into the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the popes threaten the existence of this golden dwelling and are being violently suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 papuas have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua during the seventies could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything”, a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane diocese contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture – especially frequent, as the report states, rape and electric shocks – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harrisono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Guyks were prolonged, as Papua's resources attracted the influx of other parts of Indonesia.
The province ' s 3.5-million population is 83 per cent Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan benches, warungs, sell roast chicken and a mixture of hado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to resist competition.
“Migrants have begun selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than Papuan indigenous people”, explains Abet Yow, a 20-year-old Paniai woman who moved to Jayapurou, provincial administrative centre, because of her work.
“This has resulted in the loss of Papuan indigenous mothers (women) of Papua's market.”
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, known as Jokovi, vowed to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter obtained support from 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and the local people feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” says João.
In fact, only two months after the October inauguration, Jokova Paniai suffered tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas anthems by a cat in Enarotal, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle burst out of the dark.
The frightened children told them to turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers some time later.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk chased the children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Aemo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government electoral commission building, and the next day the situation worsened.
About a thousand Papuasian men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and carried out the White, the dance of the Mee Pago tribe: running in circles and depicting a bird’s song.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation set in, the internal radio personnel were ordered to “if the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them” as claimed in an official document seen by the correspondents of the magazine TIME but not published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremias Kayama, head of the Koto district in Enarotal, felt the danger approaching and called for calm by asking the crowd to disperse from their homes.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, I suddenly had a bullet in my left wrist," he told the magazine TIME, standing on the wing of his brightly colored wooden house.
Kaime still doesn't know who shot, but says that the bullet came from the line of soldiers gathered.
"There was a crowd, there was a lot of shots," he adds.
The local resident, Alphaeus Jowa, was killed three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, relates.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to see if it was him,” said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, used only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... "I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, Senior Inspector of the Papuan Police, told reporters that his officers were only protecting their base because it had been attacked.
“We must protect ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Papua Commissioner Pujo Sulistio, a police officer in 2015.
“This is a matter of life and death”.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later Jokovi delivered a dusty speech in Jayapur expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately, so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Viranto, said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
“Most of the violations have occurred long ago.
Some of them occurred in the 90s or at the beginning of the zeros.
The point is, of course, that we want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed,” he said.
Viranto then retracted his words, speaking with the “TIME” magazine of 5 June in Jakarta, and said that he was not planning to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said: "All things shall be decided through the judgment."
Viranto, whom the United Nations accused of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the 1999 bloody vote for the independence of East Timor, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Panai incident.
The families of the victims from Paniai faced similar allegations with bitter mistrust.
“I have been questioned four times over the past three years, but there has been no change at all,” says Johannes.
I'm tired.
He says years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
“I am afraid that I will be arrested by the military, and I fear I will be shot.”
His brother, Jacobus, also expressed the view that the people of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he said.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at the villagers in nearby Paniai district of Diyay.
In a confrontation between the villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to help take a man unconscious to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, 20-year-old Ravianus Doww, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the building site belonging to the company.
According to police officers, the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But the locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began shooting at the crowd and killing one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation,” reported the 20-year-old Domingo Badiya, who lives near the hospital and has seen the wounded being rushed in a hurry.
“I hid at home for two days.”
The Diyai Parliament demanded that officers involved in the incident be called to account and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Denmark has always been a sick spot for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development is a source of resentment among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Movement for the Free of Papua (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the papuass by engaging in occasional attacks and raids with kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of OPM come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and unjustly detained by the military under the pretext of “Protection of national independence”.
Some have never returned.
Among the people of Papua Paniai, it is considered a “bee, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for the local people.
The bread is equally inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat — mainly a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can look after four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually retain most of their crops for the family, and the rest is sold locally.
Ten tubers are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequalities between indigenous papas and new migrants have increased, in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to the airport of Nabire.
Few existing vacancies usually reach more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papus rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Panai tribal council.
Exclusion keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of the international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Esquidi and Basil Longshan were deported from Papua for “weak harmonization with the organizations concerned”, despite the fact that they were rarely allowed to hold a video.
According to Félim Kine, Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, the promises made during Jokovi's electoral campaign to lift restrictions on media activities to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“For the time being, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel East Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: denial of a visa and blacklisting,” he said.
Lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mainly limited to direct neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including shootings in Panai.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
A representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanta Nassir, retracted the statement made by the group, informing journalists in Jakarta that “Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations”.
The local population wants more foreign Governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Netherlands Ambassador for Human Rights, Kiys van Baar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, the locals broke their silence by praying, “We want freedom”, as the source claims, who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will be held in 2019, but the popes say it is unlikely that Jokovi will be voted again.
“Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Panai,” says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of threats from the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in a miserable state.
Gobay says that the people of Paniai, like other papuas, consider their vote for Jokovi to be a debt that he must pay.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land in front of the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” says Jacobus, without raising his head.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper Fakel.
The fire struck one of the world's tallest skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave the 70th - story structure 337 meters high.
This is the second fire on a tall building - named Fakel - in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” told Reuters, a skyscraper named George.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, the fire brigades extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide shelter for the victims.
The accident can bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in the outer space of high-rise buildings around the world.
In the course of the investigation by the Faquela administration following the fire there in 2015, it was found that the most affected was the cry, the outside panels used for construction and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the crying panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the June fire, which killed about 80 people.
The growth of the Ida-Viruma tourist flow in June was minimal
A total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, 125 or 0.6 per cent more than the same period of the year, were used in June 2017 by the correspondent of the rus.err.ee portal in the Department of Statistics.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has decreased and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
For example, the foreign tour increased by 7.3 per cent (544) to 7,994 tourists in June.
The number of local tourists fell by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
In the region, the number of Russian tourists increased by 8.9 per cent, or 318 per cent, compared with June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,885 Russian guests stayed at Ida-Viruma hotels.
Andrei Malakov made it clear to worshipers who were responsible for his departure
Andrei Malakov hinted to his worshipers at Instagram who was responsible for his withdrawal from the First Channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumours, but today he has posted a piece of a newspaper article of 1 August.
The photograph of Malakov has been signed with a "milk boss" tag.
Article on preventing the employee's “burning” and paying attention to his or her condition.
When we recall the numerous reports that the conductor was unable to find a common language with the newcomer who started to reformat the "Let's speak", it becomes clear what he had so transparently hinted at, he writes, "CP".
It was reported that Andrei Malakhov, a television broadcaster, was currently on leave and did not sign the application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
Five soldiers were killed in an explosion in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, transmitting RIA Novosti.
According to police reports, a mined vehicle exploded the night before the military roadblock in the Girishk county.
We know 20 dead.
A new CP occurred in Giryske on Friday morning.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The exchange of fire between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver made a video of a shark bitten his camera.
Dyver and researcher Greg Scomal made a video of a shark that bit his GoPro acting camera.
Rolic placed on Facebook a unit of the United States Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, of which Scomal is a member.
The incident occurred on 2 August off the coast of Cape Cod in the north-east of the United States, specifying the Necn portal.
The man tried to take the shark off a camera held on a special stick during the underwater voyage.
After seeing a man over three meters long, the animal came close to him.
The shark started to bite the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
Somal explained that the predator had done the same to determine if he was hungry.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the instrument.
He also noted that this kind of behavior of the marine animal had turned out to be new to scientists.
The cause of mass fighting in the Arab military centre has become known.
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military Region has arrived at the Elan Training Centre, where a mass fighting took place, to investigate the incident.
Some details of this scourge have already come to light.
According to Mash's post on the Vkontakte page, contractors of the Ural military unit No. 31612 have been fiercely beaten by an unaided bed.
It all started when a private named Sayan demonically ignored an officer's order to refuel the sheets.
Officers from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Sayana supported the first company.
Within half an hour, 140 young boys were beaten in a barracks of beds and sinks, and glass was broken.
More than a dozen people were injured in the fight.
Information on the harassment was denied in the CSO.
The study found that at least one fifth of the U.S. passengers were carrying prohibited items to an aircraft.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited items on board aircraft at the U.S. Transport Security Administration inspection sites, including a minimum of 6 per cent of them on aircraft, without regard for prohibited knives or other sharp items.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had by chance carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., which covered more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately attempted to fly with something prohibited by ATB, 19.7 per cent were Millenials compared with less than 15 per cent of the X-generation.
Unawarely passing ALS personnel is the most common way to deliver food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that sharp objects had been deliberately carried out through the search, and 2.2 per cent of women respondents and 3.7 per cent of men respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried illicit drugs to the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had accidentally been smuggled through airport searches and how many had deliberately done so.
It is expected that most often, consciously or unconsciously, smuggling is done through searches by those who fly most.
According to the company, the rules of the ATB are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry or how much.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ABB selects are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ABB could be considered prohibited from entering a book.
Liquids are permitted on inland flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Pruitte abandons the intention to postpone compliance with Obama's emission reduction regulations
The day after the 15-state claim, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama's regulations aimed at reducing emissions of air pollutants leading to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision that his agency was now more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than in previous administrations.
He did not mention a claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute took place around the 1 October deadline to which the states should ensure compliance with the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone their compliance for one year to allow his office more time to study the plan and avoid “unmatchment with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, who, before President Trump was appointed to his current position, was the Attorney-General of Oklahoma, was long known as a consistent opposer of tightening environmental standards.
Following his transfer to Washington, D.C., he repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of regulations that opposed the chemical or gas-oil industry.
An unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the Puitt policy to return to the old rules.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of EPA had exceeded its authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama Administration ' s rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the diversion of methane.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that he simply met the obligation of EPA to cooperate with the states in the integrated process of implementing the new standards in a timely manner.
“In previous administrations, EPAs were often unable to meet the target date, after which they waited for claims from groups of activists and others and discussed the timing of the settlement of the case,” said Pruitt, who had filed more than a dozen claims against EPA at his previous post.
“We do not believe in regulation through trials, and we take the time frame seriously.
We also take seriously our charter and the authority it gives us.”
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point re-use his “authority to defer and other powers given by law” to ensure that the rules of “jcyjdfys are clear and available”.
The Republicans in Congress insist on a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this matter.
The Attorney-General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that had filed a claim against the EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue with legal pressure.
"The transformation of the EPA -- after our claims -- is an important victory in the fight for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the power of their cities," said Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., and D.C. joined New York.
Ozone occurs at the ground level when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight.
The resulting ability to breathe can cause serious respiratory problems for those who are sensitive to it, causing thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environmental defenders welcomed the sudden change in the Pruitt course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from the person who is responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Laurie Ann Bird of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute the air and their particular interests.”
IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
Congress of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations (IAAF) voted in favour of extending the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
In this way, Congress supported the IAAF Council for the Reconstruction of WFLA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension remain valid.
There were 166 votes in favour for the extension of the suspension, against 21 handing over the TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that WFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions established by the membership restoration board, but that those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Because of the disqualifying of WFLA at the London Peace Championship, Russian athletes were forced to act under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 persons admitted to IAAF.
WFLA was permanently disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
The report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent expert, Dick Pawn, was then published, describing numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the latest report of the IAAF Board, see “IAAF extended the sanctions against WFLA” in the “Accompany” paper.
Both defeats
Within the framework of the Russian Fonbet-Prime 3 tour of the Russian PFL teams, the New-Oskovi Chemik held a retreat against the FK Kaluga.
A little over 10 days ago, rivals played each other in a Russian cup, but this time the painting was completely different.
Chemist didn't give up on anything to the opponent, but the second-second relaxing at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After a recent hit by a Christmas tree with a score of 0:3 in it, many predicted the easy victory of their masters.
However, since the start of the meeting, the newcomers have forced themselves to be considered and acted from the defence, but from the position of the force.
In the 1st time, they built more and had the advantage of owning the ball.
Alexei Sirotin has played another very high-quality match, which has repeatedly reflected dangerous blows and has given the partners confidence in his actions.
Unfortunately, the attack on Chemik lacked the effort and the luck to put a stop to Kaluga's defense and to kill the first goal on the exit.
After the game was interrupted, I began to attend a meeting.
The Neumoscows got more involved in the attack.
An alarming call to our team was a defense error that allowed the natives to create a series of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemik seized the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the cradlers played a role -- they had a more accurate and cool ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, Chemik transferred the ball to the corner, the pitch of which the owners of the fields were transferred without resistance to the gate.
Yuri Dubrowin was the author of the goal.
In the reporting meeting, Chemik showed a good game, but he was hurt.
Our team is awaiting another exit, on 11 August at 19 a.m. in Moscow, at the Torpedo Stadium of Edward Strells, the Newborns will fight against the court of the CC Central, Ararat, which is composed of Roman Pavlucenko, Marat Izmaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support the Chemist!
Place and time of the meeting of the Newcomers: 6.30 p.m. near the Magguliya store (East, D.2, Corp.
Chemical composition: Sirotin, Manochin (k), Romachenko, Shayunov, Homotov, Gogya (Oreskin), Dodayti, Reds, Saints, Belian (Adenows), Andreichenko (Ligin)

According to published phone decryptions, Trump pressed Mexico for payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post published phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone call with the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieta Trump insisted that he stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the planned border wall.
The U.S. President scolded him for speaking publicly against the wall, and according to the news, he said to him, "You can't say it to the press."
Trump started his electoral campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia also revealed a hot crossover.
Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. agreement to accept refugees on their way to Australia was “smoothful”, “disgusting” and “stuff”, and insisted that because of the Obama agreement, he would look like an idiot because he intended to stop moving refugees to the United States.
Trump concluded the conversation by telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of all day”.
The bodies of the martyrs who died in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane belonging to Russia, carrying the bodies of Russians killed in Abkhazia, took off at 8:15 a.m. Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg and handed over TASS.
At the end point, the staff of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the City Mayor, will meet at the site and briefed the journalists by the Deputy Minister of Curorts and Tourism, Abkhazia Astamair Ahba.
The Ministry of Health stated earlier that all the costs involved in bringing bodies back to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, official Sukhumi intends to compensate the families of the deceased for 500,000 roubles.
According to Akhba, the Abkhaz leadership expressed its willingness to pay the relatives of the travel and residence of tourists who had been killed in the bombings, but the relatives had sent to the Republic only a delegation of trust to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, at about 4:20 a.m. Moscow time, two explosions occurred in the village of the Primor Gudaut district of the Ministry of Defence missile and artillery weapons, followed by the detonation of large-scale artillery shells and other ammunition.
As a result, the warehouse was set on fire and caused uncontrolled explosions of various modifications.
Two Russian citizens, Helen Polyakov, were killed in 1970 and Elena Timofeev, were born in 1962 and were at rest near a hydrogenous source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to health facilities with injuries of various degrees.
At present, seven people remain in the hospital and the rest are discharged.
A study of the Russian influence on American elections will take place by a large jury
The Russia Special Prosecutor, Robert Müller, has convened a large jury in Washington, D.C. to study Russia’s influence on the elections of the U.S. president in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The materials gathered will examine the Special Prosecutor ' s Office and decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The convening of a large jury gives Müller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury panel, which started its work a few weeks ago, will then be the details of the son's meeting, and the candidate for President Donald Trump and Russian lawyer Natalie Veselnica.
Müller himself had previously promised to verify the details of this meeting, held in June 2016.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his legal profession.
Trump Jr. had previously told him that he had been waiting for a compromise at the headquarters of the Democratic Republic of the Congo candidate Hillary Clinton, but that there had been no disclosure documents, and that was the result of the adoption.
In early August, a number of media reports reported that Trump, Jr., ' s announcement of a meeting with Veselnitzka, was literally published by Trump.
In the White House, it was clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but merely used his authority, what any father would do.
Vice Mayor Penza was detained in the workplace
The Deputy Head of Administration of Penza, Irin Chirshin, was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at his workplace, reporting to RIA Novostya.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this matter have not yet been received, but the SS press office has assured them that they will soon follow.
There's no comment on what happened at the Pensa mayor's office yet.
Irina Shirshin is one of the five deputy heads of the Pension Administration.
She has been in charge of urban planning and land relations since April 2015.
Before that, she had long served as head of the State Department of the State Department of the Pensen Region.
Irina Shishina raised three minor children, noting that once again she had been a mother for a year, she had given up her maternity leave and had returned to work.
Of course, there are no spaceships or launch missiles in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bustle is a tribute to the first person in space.
Unlike Soviet monuments, which are being destroyed in some countries, Gagarin's monuments, on the contrary, are “sneaking around the planet”.
In 2012, a monument was set up in Houston, U.S.A., near NASA's former headquarters.
In London, a monument at the Royal Observatory was installed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in Erfut, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
A monument in Carlov Varah, Czech Republic, escaped demolition in 1992 as a result of public protests and was moved from the city centre to a square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarina in Riga, a monument to Yurios Gagarinsu appeared.
That's the name of the first cosmonaut in Latvian, and he looks like if he was 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: activists lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice
Ford Mercury, in 1948, passed by the audience in Monroe, Georgia, with a roar on his way to the little Morse Ford bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her.
The chief, a middle-aged man dressed in a thin stripe, held up with a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those sitting inside trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger," the man said.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged out of his front seat by the impassioned wails.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that was played on July 22 was just a performance.
But when Roger's neck was hit with a noose, almost all the viewers actually held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night in 1946 when two black couples, Roger and Dorota Malcam and George and May Murray Dorsey, were lynching.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years, no one has been arrested -- although we see them with us; although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of Georgia's Congress who struggles for human rights all his life.
For him, a play is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the inhabitants of Monroe that injustice has never been redressed.
"We want to investigate, we want to complete, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
“We cannot move on to healing and reconciliation until we have justice.”
The Coroner covers the body of one of the lynching victims at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI ' s submissions received by E.C. News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of engaging in lynching.
But no one was charged.
Although suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always had two related motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ' s ruling for the first time allowed Black citizens to vote on the primers to be held that summer.
About the same election, according to the FBI, the black abuser Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner who appeared to be a woman in a fight.
Brooks says that according to the rumours of the city, Hester was sleeping with Malcolm Dorota's wife, and that the baby she was supposed to give birth was not from her husband.
The FBI reported that on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorota and their cousin May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove from prison and came to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of vigilantemen surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded Harrison's murders," a report by the FBI suggests.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement agencies, who not only participated in the killings but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt at election rights," he said.
"They were all killed to send a signal to the blacks in the city: if you register and vote, it will be the same with you."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green has run an annual play that reproduces that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visual, captures the viewer and tells of a deep racism that many people would like to see no more in America.
It's hard to see, and it's even harder to turn around, but Green thinks that's what's important.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own uglyness," she says.
"But I can't build relationships with you unless you hear me or hear what I've experienced."
This year's performance began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors -- a dozen whites, the rest of them blacks -- gathered in the room and listened to a year-old review of the play.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He's been the main member of the clan for several years, but he says it's never been easier.
"I think I got scared because it's not the man I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
The actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectrum begins by Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife, Dorota, screaming and pushing him.
"I said niga, get out of my house!"
Shouting Rascone back.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are broken by the homoth.
Green laughs the most.
"What is it?" Ascon asks.
He's worried and confused.
Am I winning?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the whites were saying nigga."
Yes yes, one of the black performers laughs.
"You're supposed to have a hard 'r'."
And energy changes in the room: discomfort changes with a sense of partnership.
Everyone has to do everything right, not only for the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts first.
This time, when Rascon speaks the word "n", it becomes clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The spectrum ends cruelly and quickly.
Crying, shooting, and then silence.
The woman in mourning black clothes stands above the bodies of the actors and sings the sad song of Billy Halliday "Strage Fruit."
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
A hundred yards away, half a hundred spectators wipe tears and sweat out of their eyes.
Almost equal numbers of blacks and whites are present.
One couple came from Tidi, New York, to see the performance; many live in close proximity.
They all endured Georgia's heavy spire for almost eight hours while Brooks led them off to the tombs of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, killings have been only a story, but now, as they stand in the same place where people have lynched, it seems as if their ghosts are hanging right in the air.
When the last note of the song subsides, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend to their heads, touch blood paint and fixed bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," barks one little boy, as if to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
Actors throw ropes off their necks and wipe out their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the top dollclanist.
Nick Rascón embraces two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms — the emotional load of the performance finally hit him.
"All right," one of the women whispers.
"We know your heart is good.
You had reasons for this."
Later, the audience goes to dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta have a lively discussion of the black couple they have just met.
Denise Daplinski is struggling to find words to describe what she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to these terrible, terrible words and actions... of people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now is it called what the police shoots."
In another corner of the room, Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender at food, took the general interest.
He says he's already started planning next year's presentation.
"The program is encouraging to us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their history, who don't know their history, are doomed to repeat it.”
The Court fined Navovny for violations on the “agitation Saturday”
The Simon court of Moscow fined Alexei Nvali for breaking the organization of the rally.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20, paragraph 8, of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, Judge Hizir Moussakaev of the Simon Court of Justice of Moscow had completed the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of staff of the opposition, Alexei Nvali, who had been prosecuted under the same article as Navny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the “agitation Saturday”, which was conducted in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Upon seeing the aggit material, the police officers who monitored the participants on the Sabbath considered that the organizers of the event had deliberately concealed its true substance, a public action (which required prior authorization from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazouev requested the suspension of administrative proceedings due to the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had made certain mistakes in drafting the protocol.
Volkov was not detained on the very “aggression Saturday” but received an order requiring him to appear at the police station to report the event with his active participation.
The same agendas were received by Navalil and another opposition satellite, Nicholas Leaskin.
In Mordovia, a bride and three wedding guests were arrested
The Mordovia court arrested a local resident who had shot four people, including a bride, at the wedding.
This has been reported to the Republic Directorate of the Investigation Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 July.
During the fight, a 42-year-old citizen of Saransk fired several shots at the guests who had come to the village pond to get a bite.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code (“Huliganism”), article 30 (3), and article 105 (2) (a), (e), (and) of the Criminal Code (“Trying to kill two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner for hooliganic reasons”).
According to Interfax, the local media reported that the man had opened fire because the guests of the wedding decided to dig through his section to the water.
Minenergo will tighten the requirements for power-fired turbine suppliers
The Ministry of Energy will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment such as turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines are launched, the power plant turbine, oil pumping facilities and equipment suppliers are required to share data on access with the Minenergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government Regulation was ready and had been submitted for public discussion.
New requirements will apply only to “critically important energy equipment” to Russia.
Potential threats in the document include obtaining information and access to management by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unfair partners and hackers.
The European Union has expanded anti-Russian sanctions due to Siemens
The European Union Press Service stated on 4 August that the anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded due to a scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens to Crimea.
This has been reported earlier by the "Arrangements of the Week".
The EU Council Press Service stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been expanded due to a scandal with Siemens, which had allegedly been delivered to Crimea, circumventing the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals by member countries for the expansion of anti-Russian sanctions.
It had previously been reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the current day, and the decision had been taken, the sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Pearson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British education group Pearson announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the advance dividends by 72 per cent in connection with the launching of another restructuring programme aimed at dealing with the problems faced by their business.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fallon, head of the company, will take place mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019, take place in addition to the 4,000 jobs reduced during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it planned to reduce the cost of another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May during the third cost-reduction programme to try to bring back to life a business that had been hit by a rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its forecasts for a year remained unchanged after it announced an increase of 1 per cent in sales of basic goods in the first half of the year to £2.5 billion.
Attack on the convoy in Kabul: Nato soldiers killed in the suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as reported by NATO.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the Karabah incident.
The explosion was the last of the massacres that hit Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed by the explosion at the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO reported that an explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a “man-portable improvised explosive device”.
All the wounded are reported to be in stable condition and receiving treatment at the United States Military Hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces located near Bagram.
According to UN reports, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017 and about 20 per cent in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb attack on a car caused at least 30 deaths in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed that they had attacked.
On 31 May, a violent explosion in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people — the most serious number of victims of terrorism in the country since the United States-led troops suspended the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence highlights the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while United States President Donald Trump assesses whether the number of United States military forces providing assistance to the country ' s troops and police needs to be increased.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its lines of conduct and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The American Environmental Protection Agency cancelled the decision to postpone the adoption of Obama ' s law that states should limit air-pollutant emissions one day after 15 states had sued the agency because of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “Olyses 2015 measurements”, stressing that this step is an indication of the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in and respond to dialogue with our state partners”, said Scott Pruitte, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone the measurements of ozone, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced to meet more stringent air purity standards for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, joined the Federal District of Colombia in an action claiming that the intention was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental protection regulations introduced by the previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader programme aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has led to resistance from democracies and naturalist organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website states that the use of ozone-containing air “can reduce the function of lungs and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
Association of European Business against New Anti-Russia Sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with the U.S. economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
AEB stated that business was an important link between countries and people, so free trade could not be restricted.
The European business comprises more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
The officials ask the police to limit the traffic on the coast of Pskowé.
The Pskov People's Electors addressed the UMVD chief of the town of Sergey Surin to address the problem of movement on the Great Coastal River.
The officials of the haughtiness of Constantine Bolotin, Gregory of Obedenkov, and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, driver control would help to make the area safer and more secure.
The problem is that the violators ignore the Pedestrian track and are free to ride the coast.
Major repairs and improvements have been made for nothing.
Sports and playgrounds are getting uncomfortable with cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, at evenings, the central coastal patrol is conducted by the PPP motorist and his wife.
They reduce the number of vehicles passing, but they do not stop driving completely.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to remove the hard drives
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, suggested that the investigative authorities should be prohibited from removing servers and hard drives from the workplaces.
This was stated by the Head of State at the meeting on investment development programmes in the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary “to eliminate, in the interest of investigation, the use of measures that would lead to the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from computers and servers”.
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, “it is sufficient to take copies, assure them and use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that it was not possible “to create conditions that would prevent a business from continuing until taxes could be paid”.
Olga Bosová told me how badly she wanted to call her ex-wife.
Olga Bouzová, a television columnist, confessed that she was eager to call the former football husband, Dimitri Tarasov.
At the moment, famous people are in the United States, where they work.
Just the day before Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on the Instagram social network.
She reported that she had not married, taken any new tattoos, or named her ex-wife, saying that he had ruined her life, although she was eager to do so.
Buzova said she'd remember this trip forever because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played magic Minister Cornelius Fudge in the display of the Harry Potter novel series, died at 92 years of age.
That's what The Independent reported on Thursday.
His family told him about the actor's death.
According to them, he lived “a life of great success in film, theatre and television in 70 years of his career”.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort city of Cheltnem.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theater, he played with Lawrence Olivier on "Coriolan Trajeda".
Hardy also remembered the repeated role played by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agatha Christi's screens on Miss Marvel.
On the other hand, Churchill was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Awards in the BBC Churchhill: The Wilderness Years (1981).
Robert Hardy also had to serve as U.S. president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
There was something in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and actually Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with his royal wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year's four-year-old "golden" wedding, but the couple's agenda is not about preparing for a celebration, but about a heated dispute.
His Highness refused the title of Prince Consortium, and he said to the queen that he had never been spared the title of King Consortium.
Henryk lives in France, although he remains the queen's official wife.
Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged Washington to stop slandering Moscow.
At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Mike Pens, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans, responded.
The application was circulated by the foreign policy agency some time ago.
In its commentary, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the United States is increasingly using cold war images that are inadequately modern.
In addition, Russian diplomats have called on the United States authorities to stop the flogging of the Russian Federation.
According to the Week before, U.S. Vice-President Mike Pens accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and of organizing a failed coup d'état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasili Lomachenko are meeting for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive match.
Vasili Lomachenko and Mike Garcia, who seem to be moving steadily towards the most exciting boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN Canal in Los Angeles until Garcia, an unconquered champion in the light weight of the World Boxing Council, went down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, a World Boxing Organization champion in the second half weight.
After the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former World Champion in the four weight categories by Erian Broner on Saturday, both boxers are in the top five boxers, regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck with that."
Lomachenko defends his belt in conjunction with Miguel Marriga on Saturday at seven o'clock in the evening on ESPN.
When the boxers called for the photo, the manager of Lomachenko Egis Climas noticed that a potential decisive battle between them would have been the very first time.
"I used to be half-weighted," said Garcia.
"I came up for Broner [up to £144], but I'm not that big.
I'm not enough for 140.
I want to go down to the semicircle.
And he needs to get up to half a pound [135 lb], and then we can make a match.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give them this.’
Lomachenko agreed.
"Box needs this match."
Climas asked whether the battle should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of the strategy he was following for Lomachenko to carry out his debut battle in the weight of 135 later this year in order to appoint for the next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who was also interested in fighting against the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luc Campbell after their battle for the title of the light-weight world champion in the Forum arena on 23 September.
“The battle can be on PPV because all the fans have asked for it,” said Garcia, expressing his willingness to fight later on the channel that will offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names would be of such interest.
As soon as they're ready...
Garcia said he thought Lomachenko was a "extreme boxer" and maybe he'd visit his Saturday party.
But Lomachenko didn't start to praise Garcia right away and said that he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you were on a knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on showing the force of the impact and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension rising before their own team.
“This battle must take place.
No other fight is so interesting and so much to talk about.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great battle.”
On several central streets, Moscow will shut down the weekend
On this weekend, 5 and 6 August, the movement will be restricted in the capital at Tver Street from the Nastasin Lane to the Triumph Square, as well as on the 1st Tver Street.
In addition, the trip will be closed on the Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tver Man Street.
At all sites, the overlap will operate on both lanes, reporting to the Information Centre of the Moscow Department of Transport.
The streets will be closed from midnight on 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August for improvement.
Also on the weekend, traffic will be closed on the Moscow coast.
The park is still under construction.
Putin ordered the Attorney General's Office to verify Baikal
The President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, instructed the Office of the Attorney-General of the Russian Federation to carry out an inspection of the territory of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“Please request the Office of the Attorney-General to verify the Baikal territory with regard to illegal and environmentally harmful activities”, said Vladimir Putin at the meeting on environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested that measures be taken if violations were to be found.
New results of tests to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of the asylum-seekers ' tests in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of age, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Agency of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age of asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for not being able to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensics agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were assessed as being 18 years of age or older, while in 25 other cases, the forensic medical agency estimated that the tested person “is likely to be 18 years of age or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the opinion stated that a person “is likely to be less than 18”.
Tests are conducted only when the age of the person is in doubt.
According to Johan Goransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with the results of past months.
“We don't see much difference with the statistics of past months, the numbers are quite appropriate”, he said on the portal ‘The Local.'
The high proportion of cases in which people have been assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “most likely the age of the test is 18 years or more”.
However, after considering the 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a public statement had been made that 18 was being fulfilled this year.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of age, which is to X-ray the teeth of wisdom and tomography of knee joints and to submit them to dentists and radiologists, has also led to criticism in some authorities.
One of the sceptics is an endocrinologist at the Karolin Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have gone through puberty before or after normal.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I don't think I should use the measurement methods that are being used.
The biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can't define it with confidence, we don't have to pretend we can do it," he said to the newspaper Metro.
However, Goeransen, of the Forensic Medicine Agency, said in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, the risk of mistaking a child for an adult child can be said.
We face the greatest risk when a person will soon be 18 and then about 10 per cent.”
I'll see if I can run for president.
During a working visit to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was prepared to consider whether he would run for the presidency of Russia in 2018, and that he would pass the Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request of the inhabitants of the village of Tormuška in the province of Buryat.
During a video conference on fire management in Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the interviewer addressed Putin, saying, "Vladimir Vladimirovic, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election comes, we ask you all to run again."
"All right, I'll think about it, thank you," said the president.
On 28 July, President Dimitri Peskov, the spokesman of the Russian Federation, commented on comments by some media that Vladimir Putin's pre-election headquarters would be headed by the head of the administration of President Anton Vaino.
The sands called these assumptions “unfounded, hypothetical reasonings”.
"Until no headquarters, before the establishment of the headquarters far, before the election campaign far," said Peskov.
"Not until it's on the agenda," said Sandy.
The Governor of West Virginia stated that he was moving to another party.
The Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justice, announced Thursday during a meeting with President Trump, who is moving to another party.
“You like it or not, but the democracies have moved away from me,” said Governor Justice.
“I am speaking to you today with many prayers and many reflections... today I am telling you, the people of West Virginia, that I can no longer be of use to you as governor-democracy.”
The rally blew up with applause.
“That's why tomorrow I will change my registration to a Republican,” Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play differently."
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won the 42 per cent victory in West Virginia and Justice did not support the Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited coal from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “The transition of Governor Justice to another party is another blow against the Democratic Party which is more likely to interfere than working to make our country big again”.
“Taking into account only 15 governors and controlling the lowest number of state legislatures in history, the Governor’s statement of Justice is just another rejection of the party, which has no leaders from above and is unable to find a positive, unifying message”, reported a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDeniel.
The cat's name is Mr. Beautiful found the house thanks to the social media.
A pilot in Pittsborough, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat named Mr. Beauty who weighed more than ten pounds [14 kg] after becoming famous for the Internet.
This is reported by the Mashable.
At the end of June, a picture of the cat was published on Facebook's garden account asking him to find his owner because "his food was obviously previously fed."
In comments, users noted that the expression of an animal’s face could become a new memorial.
The publication has received more than 3,000 swearers and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people have expressed their desire to welcome Mr. Beauty.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazi (Angela Fraze), who promised to do more.
In a WNCN radio interview, an American woman said that she had experience like this: she took home a cat weighing about ten kilograms, and now he weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
Over 68,000 views were collected from the animal’s photo post.
The commentators noted that she might well have made a career in model business.
Kou commended Russia's “exclusive” apology for the Doping scandal
An international expert in the easy athletics Sebastian Cowe commended Thursday for what he called sincere apology from Russia for the Doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not the right time to allow the country to participate again in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Lung Athletics, Dimitri Puttin, reported to the Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations, which had been held the day before the World Lung Athletics Championship, that his country's removal from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals in the competition”.
Despite his comments, Congress of the International Association of Lung Federations voted in favour of maintaining the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of State-funded doping.
“I felt that today’s response, today’s report, was very sincere,” said the President of the International Association of Athletic Federations, Koe.
“All the council and Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself recognized that it had been in extremely hot times and was now doing everything possible to ensure that the federation was restructured.”
Kou said that he also “beloved” that Russia agreed to the criteria for its reconstruction.
“I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which it is not the time to restore Russia to its rights,” said Koh.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to address this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tarnished system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, in line with the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, will participate under neutral flag in the World Light Athletic Championship, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met for the reconstruction of Russia.
As he told London reporters after a report by the International Association of Athletic Federations Council, drug testing is still not done in sufficient volume, and isolated coaches are still doing their job peacefully.
The Court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of conversion
The detained Ukrainian Security Service (SSS) journalist Vasili Muravitsky is taken into custody for two months and handed over to SSA.
An Internet official, Journal Gitomira, is suspected of treason by placing his publications on Russian websites and attacking the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering this to be a “barbar policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
A commanding vessel, Commander Borsini, entered Libya's territorial waters to stop the flow of illegal migrants along with its Navy.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome has agreed to it with the internationally recognized Libyan Government, which, however, does not control most of the country ' s territory.
The opposition cabinet and the Tobruk-based Libyan Parliament accused Italy of violating Libya ' s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they claimed not to believe these threats and intend to send another warship into Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Head of the European-recognized Libyan Cabinet, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities launched a maritime mission to combat illegal migration following the release in July of statistics on the number of illegals entering the country from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
The big-scale crash occurred in Skype
A global failure in Skype service was recorded today in several countries around the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began sending complaints to the programme developers.
In Microsoft, it was emphasized that experts were already working actively to address the problems faced by Europeans and North Americans, adding RIA “News”.
We'll recall that in June of this year Skype also happened.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
The two leaders of the assembled Ukraine for light athletics were suspended from participating in the FM
Olga Landska and Olice Povoch, specializing in the short run, are excluded from the assembly Ukraine at the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on on the website of the Federation of Light Athletics of the Country (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings by the International Association of Lung Federations (IAAF).
Co-worker Sergey Bassenko was also expelled from the Ukrainian delegation.
IAAF suspects women are suspected of doping, says the Sportarena.
Powkh is the Bronze Pier of the Olympiad (2012) and World Cup 2011 and the European 2010 Championship of the Estafeet 4-100 metres, and the Lander of the European First Century 2012 in the Estafeet 4-400 metres.
The World Light Athletic Championship in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neimar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited expenditure by European football clubs will not prevent the world-class transfer of Neimar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Parry St. German.
Whatever the consequences, the chain may be further developed, for Parry St. German by UEFA, the governing body in charge of European football, in whose authorities prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious championship League tournament.
It follows from the Financial Fair Plei rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, that SGW will eventually have to show that Neimar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid Euro222 million ($262 million) only to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neimar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
These are some of the financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
It is clear that SPLG may have faltered to hire Neimar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to achieve a profitability threshold in their football business.
FFF introduced Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
A former French football player believed that clubs that went into huge debt in their quest for success were basically cheating and risking destruction if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FPF stopped focusing on club debt and instead switched to tracking its losses.
As a result of this change in the business model originally used by Roman Abrahamovich in Chelsea in 2003, buying a club with good potential and then seriously spending to improve the team and create a global brand has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year assessment period, which takes over 2018, clubs may suffer a loss of Euro30 million.
And despite the shameful removal of Plato from the presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive expenditure.
“I think FFG is alive, and we are moving forward to tightening the rules”, said Andrea Traverso, an Associated Press agency last week who controls FFG in UEFA.
Although SPLP will pay for the purchase of Neimar's contract on a one-time basis, it can report on this amount for the duration of his contract.
Neimar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as a cost of Euro44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFG sanctions in 2014, heavy sanctions were imposed on SPM and Abou Dhabi Manchester City.
SWW was fined 60 million euros (at the rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to Euro20 million, and it was ordered to limit the composition of its team in the Champion League during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to outstretch its financial inspections by destroying their income from companies associated with the owners of the club.
Even though the Qatari company could have sponsored SPM, if the amount of funding was considered to be higher than the standard market rate, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
That was precisely what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the funding of SWD by the Qatar Tourism Authority had been scattered.
It was reported that part of Neimar's earnings at SWD could have been paid by the organization committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But SWA and Qatar 2022 deny that Neimar will be the Ambassador of the Peace Championship, and such a manoeuvre could easily have been detected by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on SPLM mean that UEFA will be even more careful to monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by those familiar with the situation, UEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with SPLM regarding the transfer of Neimar.
They were in contact with Associated Press on an anonymous basis, as they were not authorized to discuss the provision of SPM.
According to the latest published report, between 2015 and 1016, SWD earned more than 10 million euros in circulation at Euro542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
SWD expects that Neimar's arrival will be a favourable ground for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attributes and T-shirts with a team logo.
At the club, it is expected that the increase will be at least 30 per cent due to the recruitment of a new player.
Undeniably angry with the fact that one of the best football players was leaving, the Spanish League tried to prevent the transfer of Neimar by claiming that SPL would violate the financial “fair-fire”.
“This is an obvious case of financial doping, with a club and State”, said the Spanish newspaper “AS” to President La League Javier Tebas, meaning that Qatar is the ultimate owner of SWD.
Arsenala coach Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnet, shares La League's doubts about the financing of the club by the State.
“It's all the consequences of equity participation, and it's completely changed the landscape of football over the past 15 years,” Wenger stated on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is becoming very difficult to comply with the financial fair plai, because a country may have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The manner and place of the oath will be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will pledge allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President will determine such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law, and have drafted a committee of the States of Law and State.
A week ago, deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for taking an oath in the law.
Children up to the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as from incapacity, and from the finalized text of the amendments to the draft law on the nationality of the Russian Federation (which is available to the “Report”), which the Committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of taking an oath at the time of accession to Russian citizenship, instead of formally signing documents, was supported by President Vladimir Putin on 6 June during a meeting with Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
Member States have formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the draft law abolishing the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of offences of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public incitement to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 205.2, para. 2, of the Criminal Code), as well as for hijacking an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is related to terrorism (art. 211, para. 4, of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, the logic of the bill was that, when a person makes documents for citizenship, he is signed on the promise to comply with Russian law - on the path of extremism - he is in violation of that promise.
The draft law was introduced into the State in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev (“One Russia”), Gennady Zuganov (PRPF), Vladimir Zyrinowski (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("The Just Russia") and the Speaker of DG Vyacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies accepted him on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State and Law approved the text of the draft for second reading, but it has now been re-examined.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will establish the order of oaths.
In the past, parliamentarians had intended to describe the procedure directly in the Law on the Nationality of the Russian Federation, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting before the Russian State emblem and flag in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place, a list of the places where the Herb of the Russian Federation could be located, was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of State of the entities, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, they could have been the U.S.
The oaths of solemnity to which the Russian Federation wishes to acquire citizenship will be made after officials have checked their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be obtained after the oath has been made from the finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should be preceded by the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
There is still a rule by which incapacity or limited capacity will be released from the oath, as well as those who are unable to deliver, read or hand-writtenly sign the text of the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to be released from this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated bill also provides for a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukraine who are considered to be Russian speakers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by making a declaration to the competent authority of Ukraine.
Notarized copies of the statement will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
A waiver of “other” nationality, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for in an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the control of the individual”.
An amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first Vice-President, DG Ivan Melnikov (PRPF), Natalia Polonsky, Pavel Krashennikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all “One Russia”).
I think many of you know that it is impossible to obtain a certificate from Ukraine.
Accordingly, a large number of people are awaiting a solution to their fate with regard to the citizenship of the Russian Federation,” explained Paul Krashennikov (ER) head of the Duma Committee on State and Law the previous day.
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on certain posts for aliens would not apply to those who had writtenly rejected the “other” nationality and had submitted the previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs but who, “for reasons beyond their control”, had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from taking office in municipal service, from being employed for facilities and organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual nationality or a residence permit may not become a member of the State or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is envisaged that the law should enter into force on 1 September 2017 and that the necessary secondary legislation should be ready by that time.
Nostalgia is becoming a niche in the U.S. Star and the Warp Detective.
The current theory of nostalgically reminds at the same time of the famous days of the figures in the 1980s; the era of the Grandgage in the 1990s (about the time when eminent masters David Wayne and Michael Svalveter made a comedy of the "State" for the MTV); and themselves, that is, in 2001, before her stars, Elizabeth Banks, Amy Pauler and Paul Radd, moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the exaltation and realization of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
The first day of the camp was surprisingly good, not only because of absurd humor (including the original story of a talking can of vegetables by H. John Benjamin).
The result is doubling the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached the age of majority; this makes it impossible to get back into the joke.
“Ten years later”, where adults were already playing adults, had less emotional roots, and its parody was more unsystemic and included reefs from the steel films of the 1990s, such as “Rooks rolling the cradle”.
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled skates, and "a lot of other things since 1991."
Many plot moves are the same.
Good - natured Coop, now a writer, has not yet gained reciprocity from Cathy (Marguerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still virgin.
And there's this crazy and vicious conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (so Schowolter) is now instigated by George Bush the Elder (a proven parody in Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of a franchise is the retreat from it.
It's especially fun to see young Radd singing Matt Dillon's song from One Eye, whose character Andy's former big man looks old.
This franchise could have been successful if it had been an occasional madness in the spirit of the "Seven Up" recursion until it reached what I thought would be its logical conclusion: "A Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where, in the last scene, the whole company would have gone to the movie's premier movie, "A Mountain American Summer."
The "Common Detective" in the Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: the memory of the cold war from the "Americans", the "Blonde Explosive" or even the "Blake" with its images of the East and West struggles.
This comedy, created by Brian Heitwood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riz Thomas, depicts a television film: the 1980s Romanian police drama about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Lenin road.
The main roles, which Gregor saw and idealist Josef, were played by Florin Pierrek Jr. and Cornelio Ulic, and their dialogues in English were in Chenning Tatum (but the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Lavit.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (policemen spend time watching chess games how Americans can watch football).
A team of famous frame-by-frame votes -- among them Jenny Slat, Nick Offferman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny -- makes it interesting to play "Audience Voice."
But comrade Detective is holding on to the craziness of the glamorous propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are prolonged, and fun isn't too often.
If it were to be made shorter, the "Command Detective" could better cope with its satire in the spirit of agitpropa; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, two fat men were sitting in the lobby eating up a bunch of hamburgers.
The seeming Communist viewer says Western culture can do anything about it.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them.
The Spartacus and Locomotive Superb Cup for Russia will be about 30 million roubles between Spartacus and Locomotive.
This was reported by the President of the Russian football premier League (PFL), Sergei Prwkin, at a press conference.
According to the chapter of the RFFL, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that so far there had been little left for the match.
Spartacus- Locomotive will be held on Friday, 14 July, at 9:30 p.m.
TASS notes that Spartacus is an active champion of the Russian Federation and Locomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young U.S. U.S. U.S. U.
A 37-year-old U.S. official who had a furniture firm had approached the police the other day.
The man claimed the theft of expensive tools from the shop, causing serious damage to his production.
The thieves ’ prey has become tools worth almost 200,000 roubles — two welds, a perforator, a hydraulics, and a swan.
The security guards began to search for the criminals and soon arrived at the residents of the Bashcortostan region, which was 23 and 24 years old.
According to the media service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, accomplices entered the enterprise, broke the entrance door and removed the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold stolen equipment to the first hit car service.
They had already been prosecuted for theft and law enforcement officials had been able to return only part of the stolen instruments to the legitimate owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words about the relations between the Russian Federation and the United States.
The US and Russia should be able to work together.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State of Heather Nauert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dimitri Medvedev, concerning the relations of the two States.
The head of the Russian Government stated earlier that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the Russian Federation a fully valued trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were at a “low level”, but noted that it was necessary to seek “areas for interaction”.
"Look at the truce in south-west Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," says RIA News diplomat.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK, by President Donald Trump of the United States, has been signed on the past Wednesday.
He admitted, however, that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior grew rose from amethysts and quartz
The jubilant unit of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - added to the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They've got five new rings and three pickles on the sand tapes.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line produced two new rings and a pool of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds made in the technique of glyptics (hand-cut stone) and venerables dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the home.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellán was inspired by the roses that had grown in his home in Granville by a modeler, Christian Dior, and the Paris Gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found those responsible for the deterioration of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump strongly criticized Congressers.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, the same people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
On the previous day, Donald Trump had signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
In particular, they affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently issued a presidential statement stating that the law would not allow the US to enter into beneficial transactions and would further bring the Russian Federation, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian businessman refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
Viktor Prokokena, a Belarusian businessman, withdrew a request from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to purchase a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to the RBC with the intention of “concentrating on other of our planned investments and projects on which we are working”.
According to Mr. Prokogeni, such a step would be “the best investment of time”, despite the investment attraction of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main applicant for the purchase of a unit of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the Norvik Bank Grygoriya Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Sayid Guceriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Peter Poroshenko, imposed sanctions on their daughter structures in March.
One such financial organization, other than the WTB and the Wneconombank, became Sberbank.
Now, the new man called the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
At the Ministry of Energy, the Russian Federation named the cause of the blackauta in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Nowak, made an explanation.
He said that the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in the Krasnodar province.
The vehicle hit by the accident was power lines, and Cuban and associated Crimean networks were shut down.
Power failures in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The experts resolved the problems within a few hours.
It was initially reported that an abnormal heat could have contributed to the blunkout.
The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25 per cent interest rate
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and declining inflation have reduced rumours of possible increases.
The Bank of England had warned that economic growth would remain slow and had left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressures on family income.
Specialists of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to maintain rates of 0.25 per cent, with fewer committee members voting this month for an increase in the rate, as weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly report on inflation, the Bank limited its projections to a rise of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank had warned that higher rates would be necessary in the next few years to control brexitary inflation and had stated that borrowing costs were likely to rise stronger than expected in financial markets.
The committee members also voted in favour of abandoning part of the huge economic development package launched one year ago by brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close the urgent funding plan for which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it has reported that it is now expected to provide an additional £15 billion — up to £115 billion.
In the rate decision protocol, the bank said: “In accordance with MPC’s main projections, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) will soon remain slow, while pressure on real family income continues to affect consumption”.
On the question of rates, he reiterated that “some tightening of financial policies” would be “a little more” than markets expected to stop inflation.
The markets now predict the first increase in the third quarter of the following year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all promotions would be “step-by-step” and “limited”.
Bank projections for this and next year's promotions are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank maintained its forecast of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After these news reports, the shearing fell in relation to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and by 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth rates weakened the higher expectations; GDP then increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the bank representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest report on inflation has given little reason for joy to households, which have been affected by high inflation and very little wage increases: the bank says that pressure will increase before it decreases.
The Bank added that the financial policy “could not prevent” success in the next few years, but expected that “significantly” salaries would be restored by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also oriented towards growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods resulting from the low rate of the pound, which offsets some of the reduced consumption costs.
The decision was taken one year after the rate had been reduced to 0.25 per cent last August following the shocking outcome of the referendum on European Union withdrawal, which led to the pound falling.
The bank estimates that it will take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision on the rates, there was a noise around the anticipated increase in the rates, as inflation increasingly put pressure on the already under pressure from households: the three members of the committee were asked to raise the rates to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation dropped to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the fall was expected and that it was again being compensated in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher rate than the 2 per cent planned is the result of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco’s mortgage brokers, said: “If you take account of the recent drop in swap courses, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as creditors demand business opportunities and expect a good year’s end.
The market is particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, as the refinancing of loans, often without a commission and with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
The Public Health Service will prescribe an HIV-provoking drug for 10,000 people
Since September, patients will have access to a post-war “revolutionary” HIV prevention drug in the High Court for funding a drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-conspiracy prevention of HIV (PREP), a drug taken before sex which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection among people at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the Health Service for an initial three-year probationary period of approximately 10,000 people.
It agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ' s ruling last year, which stated that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay for the RES despite its claim that it should be financed by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was described as “the most important innovation” by Simon Stevens, President of the National Health Service of England, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it “a turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the programme all over England by April 2018, venereal dispensers in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffilde will be among the first to register people, and many more will join the program in October.
Preconception prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV drugs used to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that EPRs significantly reduce the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
In the case of pre-sexual sex, there are enough prescribed drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for medication include homosexual and bisexual men, transgeners and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispansers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are unknown, whether their HIV status is being hampered by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live and are assigned to a doctor of general practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal dispensary participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England this week, after an international procurement tender, has signed a drug supply contract.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of the EPP by collecting clinical data on who the target audience is, on its perceived level, and on a large scale.
“This crucial innovation should complement and strengthen the broad and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Control Agency), stated: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If properly targeted at people in need and at risk, the RES provides an opportunity to change the status of the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people in the HIV risk group have been able to access a new means of opening up to the National Health Service in England without discussing it with a partner, which will improve many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first thing we need to do now is to make sure that the test is rapidly unfolded throughout the country and that none of the HIV risk groups is forgotten.
Now that we are provided with a pilot drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
The shadow Minister of People's Health, Sharon Hodgson, said: “We very much welcome the beginning of the PRE test; it is very late for months of delays and delays on the part of the Government.”
The data show how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the transmission of this rock infection.
This test will bring us closer to a full understanding of the benefits of RES.
It is now important that the test be launched as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect those at risk of HIV and to move us further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution on support for the Treaty of Tatar and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WTC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of retaining the office of President in Tatar.
According to the document, the post is “a positively established form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatar.
According to the document, it “has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatar and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
We will recall that since 24 July 2007, a treaty between Moscow and Kazanja has been concluded for 10 years.
On 11 July, the President of the Russian Federation was requested to extend the agreement and retain the name of the Head of the Region.
Tatar is now the only federal entity that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose post is called “President”.
In Russia, international driving rights were difficult to obtain
There is a shortage of international driving permits (IEDs) for HBDD units.
In order to obtain such rights, it is necessary to wait a few weeks to take turns, which is a real problem for vacationers wishing to leave abroad on their car or rent it.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains controversial.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs had been introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written on the national certificate, as the information was explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In reality, however, everything depends on a specific police or rental office: some require the Ministry of Internal Affairs and others have sufficient national rights.
In order to be safe, drivers of international law are still granted, but it is worth noting that in the non-ratification countries (e.g. the United States, Mexico, Indonesia, Spain) authorities may not recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with forms in almost all GIBD units, reporting to Commersanta, conducting a study in a number of regions.
In Moscow, for example, there are no signposts in the UGBD units, and the forms are missing for four months.
You can sign up on the public service website, but the line is already long enough by mid - August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is not possible to obtain the IDP “for technical reasons”, without going into detail, in the Samarsk region, it is honest to say that there are no forms and the situation is similar in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, and there are increasing reports on social media:
Irina Bourmistre: "Well, guess why in Moscow you can't get international rights."
That's right, 'cause all HYBD's offices have completed their forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "The question of knowledgeable people!"
International rights must be obtained very urgently.
In Moscow there is always a long way ahead, and there are no stamps on the spot (a button is available, but a plate cannot be given).
It's like a public service portal shows that Spp time is free to fail.
Has anyone tried to get into another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the requirements for international driving permits have changed, and new forms are being supplied to the units of the State Inspectorate.
This may be the result of a deficit, but it is not clear what changes are being made, but it has not been reported earlier.
The form is purchased by the Specialized Centre for Road Traffic Safety (CVOC) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplied to the HBDG units.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with the OA “Guard”: nearly 200,000 IDP forms were produced in 2014-2015, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded with the OO “First Printing Room” on 18 July for the manufacture of 70,000 forms.
There's a version that the CSN just didn't have time for a tender, and that's why there's a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people have been able to travel to the cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so forth - instead of Europe.
Which rights are accepted there is not clear enough, and therefore people are re-ensured, and so the demand for international “goats” has arisen.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass an examination to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The new model international driving permit (IDP) has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia ' s ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
That's what he said in an interview on Friday, 4 August.
No respected international company will even go there because it risks losing its business in EU, U.S., Japan to countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
"That is, I strongly believe, no prospect for this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he felt that Russia was unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally construct smaller-scale objects.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics, entire stadiums began to collapse.
“I therefore believe that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so short-sighted to join the project,” the official noted.
On 31 July, the builders completed the build-up of a vehicle arch of the Crimean Bridge.
The Körchen Bank has completed a scaffolding of the road arch of the Crimean Bridge, which will be closed at an altitude of 45 metres from the base of the structure.
“The bridge planners prepared the railway arch for installation on the fairway supports”, reported at the project's information centre.
In April, the head of the Ministry, Maxim Sokolov, informed the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, that the construction of the site was ahead of schedule.
The Crimea Bridge will connect the Crimea Peninsula and the Krasnodar Land.
In Spain, an official who had not been to work for 10 years was dismissed
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the civil service) was the chief of Spanish official Carlos Recio to have?
The permanent walk lasted 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still dismissed.
But not his direct boss.
What only happens in the bureaucrat world.
The people seem to have been used to all the "services of the people" sprees.
And yet officials are always able to surprise those whose taxes they live well.
This time, sension complained from Spain.
There, Valencia’s archivist, Carles Recio, managed to stay out of work for ten years.
He was paid regularly.
It's worth 50,000 euros a year.
And Mr. Recio's "wonderful Times" is over.
He was dismissed by decision of the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
The investigation found that an angry walker went to the office at 7:00 a.m. to register in the electronic system.
And I went home right away.
Once again, he appeared in the workplace at 4:00 a.m. to register again in the system that he had left.
That's 10 years.
It has also come to light that the walker spent all his leisure time painting comics at home.
The members of the Valencia Legislative Assembly now think about how to punish Mr. Recio, the direct head of the legislature, who could not help but “reactively” work in his workplace.
Judges propose protection from presidents
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and to introduce their election.
For the Courts of Appeal and Cassation, the HRC wishes to introduce special districts that will not be linked to the administrative and territorial division of the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The HRC has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
The HRC carried out this work on behalf of Vladimir Putin, dated 3 January 2017, which the President gave after meeting with members of the Council.
A meeting with Council members on 8 December 2016 included individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as issues of public control in places of detention of citizens (see “Happily” of 9 December).
As a result of the work of the HRC, 25 proposals have been made, covering both the independence of the judiciary and the identification of judicial errors, as well as the financing of the courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to restrict the powers of the presidents of the courts in order to enhance the independence of the remaining judges.
If a candidate for the position of judge has successfully been successful and has received the support of the judicial community, the President of the Court, according to the HRC, should submit him for appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President should be deprived of the right to allocate cases to the judges.
This may be done by experts, perhaps by a specially written computer program.
In addition, the HRC considers that the President is not entitled “to determine the qualifications of the judge, initiate disciplinary proceedings and decide on additional material payments”.
In doing so, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to “election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves” and “to give them authority for a relatively short time with mandatory rotation”.
All presidents of the courts (from republican to district) are now appointed for six years by the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRC proposes a new appeal and appeal to the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now tied to the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
In the HRC, it is stated that “it is necessary to ensure that separate courts of appeal and Cassation are organized, not at the regional level, in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts”.
Experts base the practice of arbitration courts.
They have “judicial districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but that guarantee greater independence from regional officials who are unable to use “telephone law”.
The Justices of the Peace of the HRC suggest strengthening the people's assessors to deal with certain “civil and administrative categories”.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of employment, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
“This is just our proposals”, explained a member of the HRC, a judge of the Constitutional Court retired by Tamar Morszczekov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not limited to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (HU), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the military (among the co-defendants - the Office of the Attorney-General and the Human Rights Commissioner in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the Russian Federation, President Vyacheslav Lebedev of the military must be in office until 1 September.
Living a high life: half-daughtership and clever design techniques turned this little apartment into a living apartment in Earls Cort
Joan Lee, a former banker involved in real estate repair, moved from a space house in Nightsbridge in 2014 to an apartment in Earls Cort.
The flat is on the first floor of a nice model house in Queen Anna's style, and in favor of a new design, Joan doesn't pick up her things or move back.
"I used to live with my ex in Nightsbridge on a much larger square," Joan says.
"I've been looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day."
Since the first view, a 1,000-square-foot apartment has been renovated.
Originally, it was an apartment with one complex design bedroom – to get into the bedroom, it had to pass through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and semi-depotation to get the most out of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadah from the Notting Hill architectural design studio, "Duck & Save", to use a 12.5-foot ceiling and create a home that would not only be a successful project, but would be worthy of Joan's life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate the two spaces above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-dwelling place where one could be fully grown.
Erfana had to think creatively to cope with the reef.
“Working with steel structures is very complicated,” he explains.
“We had to place the premises so that they were one above the other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was not just necessary to build a simple platform, but to bend the structure so that it would be at the right height and allow space to be used from the top and the bottom.”
This decision allowed Erfan to make two full - size rooms above each other in the space assigned – and there's still a lot of interest.
From the semi-circuit through the venting copper light window from the Retrouvius, the view of the beautiful living room below is visible.
The starry furniture with the gold compartment, the silver accentes, and the VIV lights from Serge Muy make out the design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding visibility, space and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protection panel looks like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirror closets serve to store all Joan’s dishes.
To create a feeling of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room may block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new about the emerging kitchens.
The unique thing about this kitchen is that it's a moving up door, like in a garage.
“The engineering art was involved here”, Erfan's story of an embroiled wood and fiber shield door.
"She's fitted with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily."
With the reasonable use of storage space and space, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“In the end, the sex area is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your real estate is estimated to be,” says Erfan.
“Supremely, the real estate agent will enter and make calculations on the ground of the sex”.
Here they were able to expand the floor area using quality materials that give the space a shade of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create emotional relationships with the house,” says Erfan.
"No one falls in love with a wire in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't hurt the strings of our hearts."
This is an indication that with good design and a larger metro, the apartment can become something that's going to turn out to be amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a Commission on Cultural Policy
The Government of Russia has approved the establishment of a Commission on State Cultural Policy.
The relevant regulation is published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission would be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
A Vice-Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation has been appointed Head of the Commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dimitri Medvedev, approved in 2016 a plan to implement the State Cultural Policy Strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries and to preserve the same cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
G20 inflation has been reduced to a minimum of eight years
Consumer price increases in G20 countries have fallen to the minimum in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that the inflation rate in June 2016 was 2 per cent - lower in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Rosstat had previously reported a decrease of 0.1 per cent in the consumer price index in Russia.
The agency thus recorded the first one-week deflation in 2017.
The rate of inflation in Russia is estimated to be 4.1 per cent.
The Ministry, however, believes that the target has already been achieved - according to this agency ' s version - at 4 per cent.
Putin warned against illegal cutting of the Baikal Taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal Territory, warned against illegal forest destruction.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donski, noted that a bill had previously been drafted.
It permits deforestation during the fire-fighting process and the Government is planning to adopt it in the autumn.
The President, in turn, said that the project should be monitored so that “all things will not be cut out in a row” in the process of cutting.
Donski noted that the bill involved monitoring by MES and supervisory agencies.
Media: FAA troops secretly agree with the Donbasa militias from the command.
A regular telephone service was established on the line of armed confrontation in Donbasa.
Fighters from the warring parties regularly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and they are not aware of this at headquarters.
The FAU and the Donbasa militia have established cell phones in secret of their high command.
This is reported by the Country.ua on 4 August, with reference to the military operations in Donbassa.
According to the publication, unit commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the other side of the front and communicate with them by telephone daily.
Communication is not domestic; commanders are trying to reach some sort of tactical agreement.
Partly as a result of such discussions, there is a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists have learned of cases in which an officer has been congratulated on his birthday from his frontline, his formal enemy.
The FAR and the DDP and LDP militia have been sitting in trenches on the line of separation since the beginning of the military operation against Donbassa by Ukraine in the spring of 2014.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was instigated by the freezing of UNSSC statements of attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation.
In the Russian Foreign Political Agency, the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives are outraged by the statements of the United Nations Sowebes in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
It was recalled in the agency that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August was the third time in a month of mortar shelling by the terrorist groups Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, prohibited in the Russian Federation) and Fileak Al-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community has unanimously identified Nusra as a terrorist organization, and UNSS resolutions have been called upon to counter this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation has noted that “it seems clear that the Nusra attacks should face a general and unequivocal condemnation and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions”.
However, “the third time in a month, United States, British, French, Ukrainian and Ukrainian diplomatic representatives on the United Nations Security Council alternately, changing the tone of objections, in the name of their alleged lack of information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft Security Council statement to the press condemning terrorist attacks against the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain in the conscience of those delegations.
“It is most disturbing that the failure of the Security Council to condemn acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and attacks, gives them a sense of impunity”, stated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and added that “it is not desirable for these barbarians to have the conviction that someone on the Security Council is in union with them”.
Vladimir Putin was in favour of limiting the number of exceptional business inspections
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at an investment meeting in the Far East, stated that the number of exceptional business inspections should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number of planned ones and that the time limit for inspections should be limited to 10 days.
“Extraordinary checks are usually carried out without appropriate consultation with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3 per cent are agreed with the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the rest goes on its own”, quoted the President of TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from removing servers and hard drives from businesses.
In addition, according to the President, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
“This, I hope, will have some positive effect on business-related or business-related cases”, said the Head of State.
Other types of business inspections are increasing as a result of a moratorium on scheduled inspections, as reported by the “Happy” report.
In May, at the request of the business commander of the President of Russia, Boris Titova will conduct a survey, which revealed that there was a real replacement of the planned checks by exceptional means (from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), by prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), by raids (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and by checks on citizens ' claims (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and by administrative investigations (1.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More details on the business checks in the little business paper came on the other side.
Brothers fighting for an empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers fight for one of the largest real estate empires in Victoria, worth more than $500 million -- 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of the Carlton football club and builder Colin de Lunis lives in Turak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him with the Supreme Court for division of property and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still having a bitter dispute about the terms of divorce.
Along with their mother, Anna's brothers own 87 facilities worth more than half a billion dollars since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lunis family's property list today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in the Gold Bank and Mount Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
By agreement with Colin's late father, whom Paul describes as “the main driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lunis family, owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's property is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful reconciliation attempts, the first hearings of the Supreme Court were held.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which Paul believes Colin expelled him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but blames Paul for the incompetence of certain facilities.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he said he looked forward to a settlement of the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider seven the highest priority," he wrote.
Court costs are rising as snowball: hundreds of pages of evidence, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pietier Partners and Charter Keck Kramer are involved; both parties have engaged the most famous lawyers, including the royal lawyer Allan Meyers, and the best stokers.
Mrs. De Luteuris and her late husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they have run milk bars and gastronoms and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Colingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "the last grade of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Luis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Louigi used to tell me that she didn't want the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer a member of the De Lunis group; Colina says that Mark got 10 million when he got out of business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office".
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGir, the best friend of the TV.
Ferfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
He answered only Colin, a text message stating that, since the case had not yet been heard, “I have nothing to say. ”
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to stand up in court for the name of our family," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding that "still hopes for a solution to the conflict."
That hope must have been scattered on Friday.
"Our case will soon be decided by a court of law," wrote Colin.
The new head of Trump's apparatus plans to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others have tried and lost.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do that.
Then he'll be the first.
Polico reports that the new head of the White House's office plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news from the media, in the hope of keeping the chief in a calmer state.
That's what reporter Josh Doozy says.
"At a meeting that hosted the new head of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the head of the apparatus on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trumpe, which he hopes to solve: the bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that information should go through it - paper or briefings - because the President would be better able to make decisions if he received the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is accurate, but others have already failed in trying to calm Trump, tracking information.
President Trump's relationship with television was a few decades ago -- and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair publicity of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded,” said Sam Nanberg, former Electoral Staff Adviser, in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote to "Politico" that "in the words of six former members of the electoral staff, to control Trump's practice of Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that the personal information provided to him contained a constant flow of praises."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing on Twitter was ever "under control" was ridiculous.
Maybe these election staff members know something we don't know -- for example, that if it wasn't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets Trump didn't publish.
If his staff had kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts had not been in vain.
But no one has ever been able to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Trumpu with material -- reliable or not -- which confirms their views.
"Policy" -- right to this story -- wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to keep sending questionable information to the President.
Here's an example of a reporter named Shane Goldmacher:
"Recent and former Trump officers say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially dangerous leaks, and will not calm down until he finds who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone put a print on the President of an article from GotNews.com, the Web-provoking website of Charles C. Johnson, in which the deputy chief of apparatus, Cathy Wellsch, was accused of "standing behind a number of leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever overlooked on Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he didn't provide specific facts, or that in the past he started false accusations and then abandoned them.
Trump read the article and began asking about Wellsh."
Goldmacher adds that the then Chief of Machine Rains Prybus and the Secretary of Machine Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage and document the stream of paper that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Three months later Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
Perhaps he would be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still had a stimulant nature, and his assistants were still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
The prison prosecutor's office is fighting a HIV dissident
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the order of the Kalininian Paradise of Tumeni, who had dropped criminal proceedings against a local woman who had died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child was killed because the mother was an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of her responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished without setting a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the resident of Tumeni was brought under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (cause of death due to negligence) in April, following the death of her three-year-old daughter from HIV infection.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
“The woman did not cure herself and refused the treatment of her daughter, believing that the HIV infection did not exist”, explained in the Office of the Prosecutor of the Tuman Region.
The criminal case was brought to the Kalininsky Paradise Tumeni, who decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The father of the deceased girl made the request, explaining that “I have forgiven my wife, I have no claim against her, I have forgiven her and I apologized”.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office did not accept the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to terminate the case be set aside and that it be referred to a new hearing.
The girl died, and the harm caused by the crime cannot be repaired.
The HIV-positive mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat it with a dangerous infection”, reported to the press service of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In the opinion of the supervisory body, it must be punished, or it should be followed by other HIV dissidents.
According to the Tumen AIDS Centre, there are now about 12 children living with HIV in the Tumen region who are not receiving medical care because of parental refusal.
“And this situation has already improved – in the year of the special group, half of parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV have changed their minds – allowed for diagnosis, took drugs,” said Helen Lorev, a spokesman for the AIDS Center.
She said that it was impossible to influence parents by law and that not all HIV-positive children could be detected; mothers were not allowed to examine them, hide them, and run with children from hospitals.
HIV dissidents are at risk
At the end of last year, Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia’s first study of the so-called movement of HIV dissidents.
HIV dissidents are described as people who deny HIV and refuse to take medication.
Health professionals and AIDS service activists call such views anti-medical, and they see their spread as a serious threat.
The terrible photo session, which ended in the tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Grechana railway station in Khmelnitzk.
A cheerful company of drunk young people was walking a bridge over the railways, where the freight train was standing.
One of the friends had the idea of making a powerful selves on the roof of the wagon, and informed Fatam in the police communications sector in Khmelnitzka province.
The guy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion, he got caught up in the power line and immediately got hit.
Fortunately, the station dispatcher became aware of this case and immediately called for “an immediate delay”.
The victim ' s doctors were moved to a safe place prior to his arrival and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnica Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with torso burns of 1 to 2 degrees.
His condition is now valued as stable by doctors.
Law enforcement has reminded us that in recent times extreme selves on the roofs of multidecks, bridges, and traffic have become increasingly popular.
The police called on people to be vigilant and to prevent such sessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the oceans of the ancient city of Venus to exist
There could be oceans on the ancient city of Venus.
French scientists made this suggestion.
Experts have developed a computer model that demonstrates the process of water formation on the surface of the planets, writing Science News.
It turned out that at the beginning of its history, there were oceans that had 10% more water than there were now on Earth.
Previously, the Week's Arts said that scientists have suggested that the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts in their studies concluded that the water facility was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured by fire at the San Francisco Park
In San Francisco, three people were injured as a result of the shooting and handed over the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park when a large number of visitors were present.
According to the witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them took a gun and started shooting at people.
Their appearance could not be considered, for they had everything but their eyes closed.
Another was provided with medical care, after which he was released.
The third victim is a minor and there are no details about his condition.
The Dolores Park hill is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured while shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured trying to leave the premises.
Louna rock band will present a new album in Barnaul
The Louna rock concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
Musicians will present their new album "The Great New World", which has become one of the most expected releases of the year.
The team is preparing a concept show, which will become the most vivid in the band's concert history.
"The Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
His name is related to the famous anti-anti-topia novel O. Huxley, "O strange new world."
The new songs do not translate the book, but they tell of a society that lives under the law of anti-utopia, “blind faith in propaganda and imposed values”.
The group was helped to raise the money for the album: more than 1,200 people supported the project on Planet.ru.
Louna released her first album, "Make Gromche!", in 2010.
Two years later, musicians presented Time X, and in 2013, they recorded the album "We Are the Lawna" (2013).
In the autumn of 2015, the Louna group performed a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the Peace Songs program.
Among the Lucine Guervorkayan (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas-Gitara), Ruben Kazarian (histar), Sergey Ponkratiev (histar), Leonid Kinsburski (barabane).
The concert will be held at the Baraul Club on 17 October at 7 p.m.
Ticket price: 1,200 to 2,600 roubles
Louna is one of the required groups on the Russian rock scene.
The team was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The group has won a number of hits on various hit points in the Black Dugins.
The Gypsys overrun the moat and returned to the streets of the millionaires.
Some of the richest homeowners of West Midland are again competing with the determined gypsy who have overcome the trenches dug by the municipal authorities in order to reoccupy the fields near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich street of Solhall, which was called the “millionaire street”.
Bringing horses, babies and many wheelhouses with them, they returned after being expelled as early as May and were not hindered by the swarms dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed its vehicles through a section that was left unprotected to leave room for the tropics.
The angry residents attacked the municipality of Solikhallah, saying that he was “unable to solve the problem”.
An anonymous local woman said, "They came here Monday evening after being driven from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby."
Municipality should be shamed and forced to act because they are completely unable to solve the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were driven away, and they came back again.
Last night there were more gypsy, and today perhaps more.
“The Birmingham Municipality knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term court orders to protect their parks”, she added.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like the fact that I keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it.”
A local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's funny, we've just seen these gypsies leave the previous time, and please, this attack continues."
This time they were more numerous, and we even saw a horse feed on the meadow.”
A representative of the municipality of Solakhalla stated: “We know of the illegal camp on land near the Streetsbrook Road and we cooperate with the Solahall police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible”.
To help us collect evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by telephone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the champagne wine factory "New World"
The HUP of the Republic of Crimea, the “New World Champagne Wine”, has decided to share in transforming the Champagne Wine Plant “New World” into the UAO, follows the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations, Krima Anna Anuhina.
100 per cent of the shares of the enterprise will remain in the public domain of Crimea.
The capital stock of the equity society will be 595.5 million roubles and will consist of 5.955 million regular shares with a nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Crimea Ministry of Agriculture stated that if funds were not available to modernize the plant within the next three years, there would be a risk of stopping the plant.
The enterprise ' s core wear and tear is between 60 and 70 per cent.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion roubles, and due to the characteristics of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of its revenue to the budget.
What remains is not sufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"To get money from the owner is problematic, it's difficult to talk about borrowing from large credit organizations," said Messelhos Crimea Sergei Petelin's subheadings last April.
The Crimea Parliament included the enterprise in the privatization plan for 2017.
It was suggested that it be shared and tendered.
The source of Interfax in Crimea authorities estimated the potential value of selling the business at $40 million, and the investor's investment in upgrading at $30 million.
The New World increased the production of Igritic wines by 2.8 per cent from 2015 to 1.52 million bottles in 2016.
In 2017, the New World intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The business was founded in 1878 by Prince Lvo Golitsin as the Igritic Wine factory in his acquired New World name.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Underurban third graders have destroyed more than 40 graves
The officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Suburban Region identified the citizens who had destroyed 46 graves in the cemetery of the city of Liskovo.
The perpetrators were third - class students.
The first claim that the graves had been damaged by unknowns had been made to the Russian MUPD on 27 June in the Lyskov district.
A total of 24 persons approached the police on this matter.
As a result, criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code, “Lost, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police had identified suspects and two students aged 8 and 9 had been found.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing monuments fall, and this led them to hooliganism.
Preventive measures were taken with children and their parents.
Italy was tightening the tone of NGOs saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs owned by rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new regulations governing their activities.
“If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities”, said the Minister of the Interior, Mario Minniti, in an interview with the Tunisian daily Stampa.
Minni's warning was given the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettt, suspected that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had worked for only one year, had refused to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartoio.
“For us the salvation of human life is and will remain the highest priority, and we are very sorry that we cannot now continue our activities in the search and rescue zone,” says the organization's statement in the social media.
"We will only be able to evaluate all the charges now made after we have collected all the information and been able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juvent vessel belonging to the Jugend Rett since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken on board entire lifeboats of migrants who were sent directly by traffickers to them and of allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting was supposed to have taken place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as stated in the prosecution records published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coast authorities, who control rescue operations in the zone, rather than for any other reason.
The code of conduct implies primarily that the Juventa-type vessels will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code “Stay Children”, the Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa, the Out-of-the-Breaks of Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they did not involve any “significant change or interference” in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are the Nobel prize-winning organization Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minnit said that the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support Libyan coast guards and cooperation with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, the Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we do not want to associate with either side of the conflict.”
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently significantly increased their policy in the Libyan direction and, with visits to Moscow, the delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have been absent.
The head of the Russian Contact Group on the Internally Libyan Settlement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State of Gosduma, the Assistant Head of the Republic of Chechnya, Lev Dygow, explained the "Haw" goals of Moscow in the region and who is betting on it.
The Contact Group on Libya that you lead is hardly known.
Let's say the Ukrainian contact group knows about it.
And here's the secret.
What exactly are you doing, what are your goals?
A contact group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
It is administered by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov.
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan track by the Speaker of the Lord ' s Office, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The arrest in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 persons on board).
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was established, and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did you know you were the one who led her?
As I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the work of the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from Chebotariev Mechanic.
We have been able to reach out to representatives of all major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict, and to Tripoli (the United Nations-based Government, headed by Faiz Saraj. “Welcome”), and Tobruk (the Parliament, which opposes the Government and supports the Marshall Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern parts of Libya.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (the Libyan Vice-Prime — October), we were able to agree quickly to release Russian sailors.
It was then decided to establish a contact group to make more effective use of these contacts.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya, we do not want to associate with either side of the conflict; we are engaged in a dialogue with all.
How many are in the contact group and how many are permanently in Libya?
The contact group now has five members.
Among them are people with experience in the security structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to join the regional team of specialists from the Institute of the Middle East of the Ran.
There is no staff member in Libya at all times, and that is not necessary.
Whether there are Russian military advisers in Libya now, instructors.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group has military ex-combatants...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities closed to a certain point for us, such as Misurata (where militias are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Kadhafi in 2011 and which were significantly intensified in subsequent years.
We arrived in Misurat in January this year.
We were scared, they said you'd all be united by Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible, why the rumours, what the Islamists really are.
In Misurat, we met with all the members of the forces involved in the destruction of IH in Sirte (in December 2016, this Mediterranean town was taken off by the militants of Russia's banned “Islamic State” — October).
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to verify that they were the ones who played a crucial role in destroying IH in Libya, not Khalifa Khaftar, who attributed these privileges to himself.
And what did you conclude?
Did not Haftar win the Islamic State in Libya?
He didn't do it.
The Haftar conducted operations on the other front, in Benghazi.
And IHs in Sirte were fought by structures that were subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we invited people to Russia who had carried out this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived -- the visit was extended from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was admitted to the Council of the Federation, to Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Rosgvardy.
You are, as we have seen, in all Libyan regions, and you probably imagine the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris, Khalifa Khaftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, agreements will be broken, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
The fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting was a good signal to us, not too long ago.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
And with regard to Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many who believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on board the Russian air carrier Admiral Kuznetsov that day.
It was a coincidence.
But they didn't believe in a coincidence in Misurat.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is precisely to show that we do not support only Haftar; we are engaged in a dialogue with all key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar were talking.
Does understanding of Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he has studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
He's Russian if he knows, he's very relative.
But what we learned certainly facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way, he's not the only one.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak great Russian.
And they're pulling towards Russia, and they're kind of nostalgic about it.
Do you consider it likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya will be lifted quickly?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
Interested, of course, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict or want to arm others to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to contribute to the lifting of the arms embargo.
The process of drafting a constitution is under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections are to be held, as was mentioned at Saraj and Haftar.
If elections were to take place and a legitimate authority was finally elected (and no party now had such status), the issue of lifting the arms embargo could be raised in the United Nations.
To raise this issue in a meaningless and dangerous manner now would only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The media recently reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees from Libya, was feeling abandoned by all EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its relations with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the option that Haftar units will control the coast and put an end to the smuggling of immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We're actively working on this.
The Italians need Russian support because Moscow is engaged in a dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj, and Misurata and the South.
Tribes in southern Libya play a major role in this regard, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it that the south-southern prevent the flow of migrants on far-reaching approaches?
I mean, conditionally, were the buses used to drive Nigerian migrants back?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope to help unite the south in the negotiations between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But to begin with, we would like to see a consensus on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of Government in Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered to be an Islamist, a supporter of Shariah norms in the country.
How radical was his view?
Would it not be an obstacle to developing relations with Russia or the West?
I'll express my personal opinion about him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya must be a completely normal country - moderately Islamic, open peace.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It is created by those countries that do not want Russia to communicate with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where the legislature, the executive and the judiciary are located.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government entities.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
And we mixed all the cards and started talking to Tripoli and Tobruck.
We are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosnepht has concluded a cooperation agreement with Libya ' s State oil company, NOC.
The director of NO Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneffti Igor Sechin made a deal, himself from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first shipment of the Libyan oil by Rosneoft.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'll resell it.
What are Russia's economic interests in Libya?
In plans to re-sign the contracts concluded at Muammar al-Qadhafi.
These include former transport arrangements (rail construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, like Iran, it's about oil-for-services?
I don't know what the scheme is going to be, but I don't deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not important.
We are essentially involved in peacekeeping.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya has ceased to be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, that is the main task of helping the Libyan people and pushing terrorists out of it.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that no Russian and other former USSR nationals were there to date.
He said that he had about 50,000 calls from Islamist and radical groups (in Libya).
What kind of States are these militants from?
I would not like to go into these details.
Then the question will be formulated differently.
How many Islamic fighters in Libya are Libyans themselves?
The Libyans are practically non-existent, not more than 5%.
The rest of them are emasculated.
Can Moscow conduct intra-Lebanese negotiations along the lines of Paris?
There are plans like this.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and we have expressed our readiness to return to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say.
Several visits should still take place, and I hope there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.
At the Czech Museum, the charities raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Matzola, who has PCPs, brain hydrocephalia and complete blindness, will receive a special runway as a gift from the Melihoho Reserve.
Sasha is provided with a useful presentation by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region of Oksana Kosareva and the Director of the Museum of Constantine Bobkov.
The money for the trainer was collected during the charity marathon "Don't get tired of doing good" that took place in Melihov on July 15th, Chekhov Memorial Day.
The day before the marathon at the museum, they received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manuchino in Chekhovsky, saying, "I have no vision at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a gift running the path so that my legs become strong, and I'd just learn to walk."
And then Saschina's dream came true!
After the presentation at the Reserve Museum, there will be "Concert Postscriptum", a well-known pianist and well-deserved Russian artist Alexander Hindin will perform poplars from popular classical works.
During the philanthropist marathon in Melihov, there was a chorus of Wozsen Davidova Desert, the bells of the Ilya Drosdikhin workshop, the students of the P.I. Tchaikovsky Conservatory and the Gnezini Russian Academy, and the artists of the Melikhov Theatre of the Czech studio.
Public auctions were held, a book fair was organized and a gift-making fair with a marathon logo was organized.
The Melihoho Reserve Museum has taken the initiative to make Chehov Memorial Day on 15 July one day of charity in all the Podmoskovia Museum.
A 30-year-old resident of Olives Gitomir region near the local football stadium fired several shots at the young people who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angry with the noise, and was informed by Fatam at the Zhitomir Police Communications Division.
The man then entered a nearby cafe.
He had a conflict in the building, during which a man used a rubber firing device, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care and no threat to his life.
Police and medical ambulances arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled.
The law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man could not explain his actions.
He's got a rubber firing device that's sent to an examination.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code.
The detainee is liable to 3 to 7 years ' imprisonment.
We will recall that on 28 July, a shooting attack took place in Kiev on Lukiyangivka in the street of Tatar on the night of 28 July.
The sentence of Michelle Carter for reports that led to Conrad Roy's suicide
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment for having been motivated by text messages and telephone calls to suicide by her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is broken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until he appealed.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and cream blouse, listened to the sentence by standing, shaking his hands, and lowering his eyes.
"She killed Conrad Roy by her actions," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her life.
She didn't admit responsibility," she said.
"She has not shown repentance."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his view, her “age, maturity or even mental illness had not had a significant impact on her actions”.
The prosecutor read out a statement by Roy Lynn Roy's mother saying, "It's never been a day when I wouldn't have mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I do - I try to support his sisters despite the pain that will remain with us forever,” he says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was constantly thinking that she would never be able to attend his wedding or be the aunt of his children.
"To hurt a man who's always been with me since I was born is the pain that's been with me for the rest of her life," she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, since Massachusetts does not have a law that provides for the responsibility of advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been led to suicide by Carter.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know many ways," she wrote in a few messages sent two weeks before he died while he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You only have to turn on the ignition, and you're going to be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death, and he prohibited her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The legal professions disagreed on this point.
One of the few defenders of Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for killing his British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published her special opinion in the Los Angeles Times, which stated: “Michael Carter deserves sympathy and assistance, not prison”.
"I let Langford go like a high-fly bird."
One of the best basketball players of the WTB 33-year-old Keith Langford left Unix.
The departure of the American defender Izvedov was commented on by Unixa's President, Eugenius.
Keith made this decision about family circumstances, and told Eugenius Bog.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons in Unikas, and in each match, he showed a high level, he scored 100 per cent.
That's why I let it go like a high-fly bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and his career as a playmate.
Keith Langford played at the Casan Club for three years, winning the silver of the Single League for 2015/16.
During the 2016/17 season, he was awarded a prize to the most effective player in the Euroliga season.
He averaged 21.75 points per match.
The result has been the second since 2004, when the award was awarded.
Langford, who also won the 2014 award, became the second player in the history of the European Union, receiving the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with China's Shenzhen, informing Eurooops.
The American is expected to enter into a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second-largest Euroliga star in July to be a Chinese championship.
Jannis Burusis had previously moved to China's CBA.
A sun-lit traveler from Podmoskovia was evacuated by helicopter to Adigea
Today, a helicopter evacuated from the mountain region of the Republic by an Adigee rescuer, who received the greatest sunburn.
The man was resting at the Pisht, at an altitude of 16,000 metres.
A 27-year-old tourist was subjected to increased pressure and difficult breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuer was approached by the leader of the tour team, who told him that a man had been burned in the camp.
Audi will be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW stated that it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The Chairman of BMW stated that the company believed that “there are more intelligent ways than restrictions on driving”, with reference to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – which considered the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel cars.
Damler stated on Thursday that he was modifying three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their step a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But nitrogen oxides, which release diesel engines, are considered cancers and can cause asthma.
The cost of auto-producers of diesel car exhaust neutrals is also increasing, and maintaining a competitive car price is becoming difficult.
While German car manufacturers are under close scrutiny, the Chancellor’s Government, Angela Merkel, has also been accused of following powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs of problems.
Companies try not to repeat Volkswagen's mistake, which concealed the use of so-called “damage devices”, which, during testing, were able to adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the regulations and, in normal driving conditions, were disabled.
In the United States, several leaders of Volkswagen were convicted and the others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development team was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zakkeo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subjected to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded the investigation, which had previously been focused on the United States.
The inclusion of “Audi” in the investigation may create serious problems for “Folkswagen”: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of disproportionately large income for “Folkswagen”.
In Astrakani, a visitor to the cafe paid for the counterfeit money
The police received a report from a staff member at the bank office regarding the detection of money received from the general unit, a suspicious bill of 5,000 roubles.
A study conducted at the Criminalist Centre showed that it was false.
According to UMVD of Russia in the Astrakhan region, a visitor to the cafe who had bought the shaurum was paid by a bank note.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with the instrument to determine the authenticity of the bills.
At present, police are identifying persons involved in the manufacture and marketing of a well-known fake BF ticket.
Such offences are punishable by up to 8 years ' imprisonment with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on the residents of the Astrakhan region to pay attention to financial transactions; it is recommended that commercial workers establish instruments to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found an "Ada" planet on which even iron can swim
For the first time, after studying the characteristics of the giant exoplanetary, WASP-121b, astrophysicists were surprised by its temperature, which is able to vaporize iron and other metals.
Experts have noted that water molecules are so heated by light that infrared radiation is emitted.
The Hubble telescope recorded the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes the water in the atmosphere of the planet to shine in an infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called “hot jubilers” - gas giants of size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system but situated dozens of times closer to the parent star.
As a result of this year, the exoplanet has only 1.3 “earth” days, and its gas covering is almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but there are now fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda grew worse because of the dry weather and insects that carry disease, causing constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Shes, an expert from the Agricultural Research Institute of CRIEPAM in Provence, says, "The Lavanda in Provence is under threat because in recent years this plant has been experiencing the effects of climate change: the spring and especially in the fall of the rain have become much smaller.
This affects the life of the lavender.
And there are also small cicadas jumping through the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, there are a lot of them."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavenders are not only attracted to vacationers; lavender oil is very useful in perfumery and cosmetics.
Eric Shes says, "Instead of very long colosses with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent.
That's why we have fewer parts containing air oil."
The decisions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing the rate of evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and removing varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador Winter University 2019 met with the red-headed schoolgirls
Two-time hockey world champion, Ambassador Winter University 2019 Alexander Semin met with start-up hockeyists the day before and distributed autographs to the fans.
The meeting took place in the Winter Universals tent, 2019, as part of a thematic week on the hockey with the Shaibu.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on horseback in an artificial ice field.
In addition, squads, Victorians and games were organized to play the gift products of student games, and the removal of the Federation of Aerobics.
Fifty students attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much sports as possible and stressed that the most important part of the initial education was hard work and a great desire to do hockey.
"It's great that Krasnoyarsk has a site like Winter Universals 2019 where start-up athletes can ask direct questions to team coaches," said the champion.
Let's note that the Ambassadors of the Winter University 2019 help promote student sports and healthy lifestyles.
The University tent will work throughout the summer until 25 September, reporting to the Press Service of the Winter University 2019.
The words of Medvedev were commented on in Gosdepe
In commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister Dimitri Medvedev of the United States State Department of State, Heather Nauert stated that it was necessary to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found “to improve bilateral interaction”.
The Syria Armistice Agreement was an example of such successful cooperation by Nauert.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work together," said the diplomat.
However, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev ' s claim that Russia and the United States were in full trade war.
"If Russia has said that, then of course it has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more on this subject," said the representative of the State Department.
Formerly, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, the head of the Government of the Russian Federation, the Medvedev, stated that Washington had declared Moscow a full trade war, ending its hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that US sanctions would be in force for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes that the U.S. artifact was “purely played” Trump.
A bodibilder missing in Podmoskov was found in a foreign tribute to those who lost their memory
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov was missing on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very extreme circumstances: he left the car cabin to go to the toilet.
For seven days, it was sought without success by familiar and local residents.
And Shemil was on a strange date in Ramensk.
He was found naked in his toilet.
The Dagestan athlete was unable to explain how he was here and what had happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
The announcement of the missing person helped to establish the identity.
The medical personnel who arrived after the call recorded a partial loss of memory and brain and brain trauma in Hanmetov, reports the Mash photo.
Perhaps there are other surprises waiting for the athlete.
The perpetrators of Shemil’s abduction may have been in his apartment, the keys he was also stolen from.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion roubles
The actual oil and gas revenues received as a result of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, reports the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, the agency explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar per rouble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as to the excess of actual gas production and oil exports of projected levels.
“The rejection of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from a monthly estimate consistent with the Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected to be +40.2 billion roubles in August 2017,” says the Minfin report.
Thus, total foreign exchange purchases on the domestic currency market from 7 August to 6 September 2017 amount to roubles 47.6 billion.
Accordingly, daily purchases of foreign currency would amount to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Every working day during this period, the CB will enter into transactions to buy foreign currency in the organized tenders of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trade day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The killing of a journalist underscores that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The weekly newspaper Riodode usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss plans to highlight the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them into an office where a grenade had already been thrown in 2009 or leaving them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on the board in the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked journalists to name each column - evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal feelings will be sufficient.
They are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being held by the Government or cartels, and they are a list of bullies that make the work of reporting the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not overstretch, and more and more journalists among the corpses in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 persons are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have been killed in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspirer, the co-founder of Riodos, Javier Valdés Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdés in one of his numerous books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is everywhere - a large photograph of Valdés showing the middle finger, with the inscription “Justice” hanging on the front of the Riodosé building; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramírez, wearing T-shirts showing his smile, face in glasses or his firm Panamanian.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their overall trauma, their nightmares, their sleeplessness, their paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of drug-trafficking and organized crime-related killings every year, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodos journalists insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although they are more dangerous than ever.
Without information about the killers, without justice from the security talks at the meetings, there is little benefit, ” Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"As long as we don't know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdés left the office of Riodose in the capital city of Couliacan.
He was able to travel only a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota King; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twenteenth River".
The man who shot took off his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdés was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two grown children.
Hearings usually vary rapidly.
But Valdés is virtually silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited in the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum.
Let's not talk about killing one or more people every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or saying that the cemetery is filled with two-dwelled drug mausoleums, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that a state of calm is just when one of the cartels takes control of a maritime state with important ports and drug trafficking routes in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdés was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was crushed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damasso López, the leader of one of the rival Cartel factions who is fighting the sons of Guzman.
The publication could have made the sons angry; those allegedly members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdés to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper had been seized and wrote about the same story.
Valdés was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his murder was considered a regular milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroest, and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded Riodos, sold his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without touching on the subject of drugs," said Bohorquez.
In time, the newspaper earned the reputation of being courageous and honest, selling and advertising.
Journalists liked that they were able to publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were drawn to reading about things that no one else dared to write.
Eight years after its foundation, Riodos received a prestigious prize for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdés won the International Press Freedom Prize for the courage to investigate Mexico's drug trade wherever it may be.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ Award.
The drug trade in Sinaloa, “this is a way of life”, he said last October in an interview with Rompveento TV.
"You've got to take on the tasks that go to you as a journalist -- either that way or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around you... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodos' employees miss Valdez, a joke who scolded like a truck in a port, a friend, a generous embrace and advice, a teacher who knew how to get on with the living.
They trusted in his order.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they're asking, he's lost his love for one-time order?
His death caused them to question their calculations about how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like you in their wives, their kids, their legal business and underground drug airfields.
"These things were behind the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in better times, was a high level of self-censorship and self - preservation.
We have to trust our instincts.
Stay away from things that smell bad.
Problem, says the editor of Riodos, Andrés Villareal, is, "Abstinence can be deceived... and then what happens to Javier."
The old rules, he says, and others, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak State institutions and corrupt officials.
Landschaft is changing all the time.
In a room where Riodosé staff had gathered for security training, cell phones had suddenly been banned: a few days earlier, it had become known that spy programmes, which were being sold exclusively to Governments, were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
Outside, two policemen hide in the shade of a 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the state government to protect Riodose's office, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois quarter of Kuliacana.
Some journalists once asked if these policemen were part of those 50 per cent of the ministers of order that the governor himself had said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
In the nearest issue, Riodos had three main themes.
It's the murder of a brother of a former champion on boxing Julio Cezar Chávez.
They also had government expenditures that were concentrated in the governor ' s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Couliacan, a quarter of the DA's office.
It was not officially announced who had been kidnapped or how it had happened, so caution was needed when it came time to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant for drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had dominated all levels of government for nearly the past century.
Recently, a number of PRI governors were accused of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in the restaurant, including when Guzman's son, El Chapo, had escaped the military.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdez's column with the most reliable information on the abduction.
"We'd sooner know what happened," says 46-year-old Villaral, for her thin body called "El Flacco."
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdés Cabinet is now being used as a billboard and counter-survey warehouse against the killing of journalists because staff members have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramírez took several posters and went to the local prosecutor's office the next morning to show to another journalist.
El Salvador Adama disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdés was killed.
Found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists have spoken louder, organized protests and wrote "SOS Press" on sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorquez was in Washington, D.C., trying to obtain international support for the demands of justice in the Valdés case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez Ramírez, the authorities accused the authorities of spying for journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then asked not to give her more tasks to highlight the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdés has said on many occasions that journalists in Mexico are “enclosed” by organized crime, their accomplices in government and a careless society.
In his last book, "Drug Journalist", he wrote that reporters are not just killed by drug gangs; they do so on orders from politicians and security forces in association with organized crime.
The Arctic 19 Press Protection Committee believes that half of the attacks against journalists last year were carried out at the order of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body, allegedly written in the face of the Zetas cartel: “I'm here because of my articles”.
The computer keyboard and earphones were next to her cut head.
Some publications preferred to close up like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent, Miroslav Brich, was killed in March.
Others continue to stand as El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo following the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels by means of a first-page editorial entitled "What do you want us to do?"
Some journalists have left their native states or even their country.
It's a painful solution.
It is difficult to find work in exile and they continue to identify the dangers in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as was apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance risk solutions daily.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits he's scared to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for the press, the publishers of Riodos were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when their phones rang at the same time.
A series of gunfights between fighting gangs and security forces near the resort city of Masatlan left 19 bodies behind, according to confirmed evidence.
The war continued as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
As they sat on the sidewalk, they posted news via their mobile phone on the Riodos website.
The next day, we had to turn the front page.
Sirens were fired nearby, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes saw if the guards were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
While sitting under a huge portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was displayed for the entire Sinaloa survey, the Riodosé officers continued his case.
"How can you think about closing up," said Bohorquez, "if the very day Javier was killed, the practicing officer asked me to send her outside to report?"
Dinosaur used a compass to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, though a frightening one.
The researchers said that the first finds of an incredible creature the size of rhino found by a Canadian miner were kept so well that experts called it “Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs”.
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his groovy skin was red and brown – and to say that he had, in some way, “dark past”.
In a report published in Modern Biology, it was described as “the best preserved from Tireophorus in history and one of the best dinosaurs in the world”.
This is a fossil — a recently discovered copy of a nodozavra, which lived in the middle of a melodious period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His amazingly good condition has amazed researchers, who call him “really remarkable”.
This herbivore is the most well - preserved fossil of this type in history, according to the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fank when he was working in the Millenium Mine of Sankor near Fort McMurrey in North Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He came across something that seemed different from nature, and decided to look more carefully.
The fossil record he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrellian Palmeontology Museum.
For the next six years, efforts were made to detect an animal inside the earth’s depth with a mass of 2,500 feet (1,100 kg).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the end result can be demonstrated.
“It's only worth a little while, and you can almost believe he's asleep,” said the lead author, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrells Palmeontology Museum, where creation is demonstrated.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well preserved copies of the dinosaurs, Mona Lisa, among the dinosaurs."
By examining his skin, the researchers found that he was herbivorous, even though he was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, which seemed to be in considerable danger from the fleshy dinosaurs.
This powerfully-covered dinosaur used red and white rubber to hide from predators, and used protective equipment known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals these days.
This would allow him to blend faster and avoid encountering enemies, say the experts, assuming that larger dinosaurs were hunting him.
This creature of 110 million years of age, belonging to the Nodosur family, was widely publicized in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrell Palmeontology Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and given it the name Borealopelta markmitechelli in honor of museum labator Mark Mitchell, a member of a group who spent more than 7,000 hours digging for it.
The remarkable preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scholars to document the drawing and shape of the chicec and the puny plates on his body.
They found a protective color, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although protective coloring is common, the discovery has become a surprise because Borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than the animals currently living with protective paint.
It may be assumed that the dinosaur was so actively hunted by the fleshy dinosaurs that evolution preferred the masking of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern - day animals with protective colors — such as deer, zebras, or armouredians — are much smaller and are more accessible, indicating that nodosaura has had to struggle hard to survive.
“The serious threat posed by predators for a massive, massive dinosaur’s shell shows how dangerous the melodies were,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the dinosaur's cherries also indicated that its skin should have been red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the remaining contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where it drowned and with its back to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans are likely to have spread far inland than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is indeed remarkable in that it covers the skin of the remaining grotesque and at the same time remains fully in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal,” said Brown.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost as it looked then in the morning melodious period.
You don't have to use imagination especially to re-establish it, you just have to have a little bit of a skin, and you can almost believe he's asleep."
The iron period is an era when giant terrors, carnivorous dinosaurs, on two legs, wandered around the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the Tyrannosaurus river, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his formidable ancestors might have been hunting a Tireofor.
These include an acrocantosaurus, a monster 38 feet [11.5 m] long, weighing six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in the magazine Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to the sea after his death and mummified.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he was working in the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurrey in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to museum staff, this is the world's best preserved titrophorus, along with skin and shell, and it's fine from the face to the femur.
On average, these creatures were up to 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
They were marked by two 20th-inch shoulder spikes.
The researchers believe that this herbivorous tyreophorus was hard on what is now Canada until the spilling river carried it to the high seas.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his shell with accuracy to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular copy have been so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the burgeoning plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of security is “often like winning a lottery”.
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossil remains of the skin still cover burgery plates that fill the animal’s skull.
His right foreleg is stretched along the side, his five fingers are turned up.
I can count the teapots on his sole."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to reach Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who had previously led Georgia and then the Odessa region of Ukraine, travelled to Poland.
However, he did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted a video on its YouTube channel with its presentation.
Saakashvili addressed the commemoration of the Warsaw Rebellion against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to begin speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician addressed the topic of Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland and spoke of Ukraine.
The fact that the Ukrainian Migration Service had deprived him of his nationality had been learned by an optical politician while in the United States.
It is not yet known how he managed to make the transatlantic crossing without documents.
Previously, Mikhail Saakashvili, the former governor of Odessa province, stated that his signature on the questionnaire for the acquisition of Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not filled out any questionnaires.
The case of Weinzicher and Olhovik was extended until January
The preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Renov group of companies Evgeny Olhowick and the head of the energy-cooling company, T Plus, Boris Weinzicher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Bassman Court considers the extension of the accused ' s house arrest.
The representative of the UK at the meeting reported on the latest decision to extend the period of preliminary investigation.
“The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and assess a large number of documents, as well as to carry out investigations in the territory of several constituents of the Russian Federation,” said the investigator.
He added that suspects regularly bribed the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Mihail Slobdin, who was the head of Wimpelk, Olhojik and the former head of WAO, provided bribes to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi for setting the most favourable heat and electricity tariffs, as well as for creating an enabling business environment, until 5 September.
Weinzicher and Olhovik were arrested, staged in Sistikevkar and arrested for two months, Slobdin fled the investigation and was declared a federal wanted person.
How did one activist get the answer to the question "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shocked to the depths of his soul.
Only a day after arriving in New York, as part of her tourist tour, the mother-in-law of St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented via Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on the phone.
She came across someone from high school.
It said, "The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and he's still in the middle of the street."
Noting that none of her tapes had posted this information, confused, she closed her Facebook and opened her Twitter.
Her tape had a lot of user posts with @ThePharoah.
Reper of the Big St. Louis actually tweeted the death of Michael Brown, a unarmed black boy of 18 years of age killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown’s lifeless body, spread out in the street, where it would be held for four hours.
"It's wild," thought Ferrel.
But death was not something new to her and her circle.
She put the phone away and later in the evening she went back to tweets about people going to Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of a warning tape and shouting people and a man who claimed that he was Brown's father, who made a poster saying, "Ferguson's cop just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protestors with a barking dog.
On another video, another policeman, she said, picked up a trigger trigger and said, "I'll kill all of you... animals!"
"This is an unusual situation," by her own memory, then said Ferrel.
“It's not like the murder we're used to and we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt faint.
I was angry and crying."
She took her ticket back and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11: 00 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided they'd both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson in the next nearly three years was the subject of a new documentary film entitled "Whose Streets? " , which will appear on the screen on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was driving to Ferguson with a daughter dressed in a flower dress and a veneer of color, they recalled the conversation that had been held until this morning countless times, “the experience of the blacks and their situation”.
She remembers saying, "Do you remember me telling you how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson right now because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't help but take it," said Ferrel later.
“What's happening today is the culmination of what's happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be educated about it.
It must not only understand activism and organization well, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their status, and what we must do to be free to free ourselves.
Even if I could provide her with an environment in which she would not personally face obvious racism, she was no different from any other black girl.
I feel I would have done her a bad favor if I had made her do it."
When they arrived at Ferguson, the first stop they made was at the South Florissant Road, a square across the road from a police station that became something like a tent camp while activists waited for reports of the outcome of Officer Darren Wilson's indictment.
There Ferrel and his daughter joined a local businessman who was making lunch packs.
They collected packages and helped deliver them to the protestors.
Little by little Ferrel's consciousness has given shape to a new type of activism.
“My activism has changed completely since 9 August”, she said, noting that, as a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Sanitarian Students, National Minorities, and was engaged in food justice and health inequality among the black communities.
“I had no experience as a organizer.
It came by itself.”
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her colleagues.
Folayan said that she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado Ferrer, "just wanted to document" events.
Ferrel came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story you can play?"
This skepticism has been imposed by many people, often whites, who have come to the community to benefit from his pain and endurance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson were not at the centre of attention, and we wanted to do so differently.”
By that time, Folayan had already united with his fellow Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His participation was a source of sympathy for the Ferrel project and for six other local residents with whom the project team Whose Streets? has been in contact during the years since Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, nobody speaks for us or for us, we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
“It was the most important thing for me, as these people will be represented, because it is the way I will be represented.”
Although the aim of the project was not to focus on Ferrel's experience – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about a life-saving leader, but about how the community is uniting,” Folayan said, it was the most open member of the film.
As a result, the “Whose Streets?” showed unexpected personal aspects of Ferrel’s life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, laughing at the first time I saw the finished product.
“But I realized that when you do this work and you humanize the blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrel's history again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Life Movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - those who created the tag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the murder of Trevon Martin's black teenager in 2012 - are considered homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in leadership support this whole movement, ” says Ferrel. “ Because we fight on several fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan accepted this claim, noting that “the movement is, in fact, supported by black women and many homosexual black women”.
Nevertheless, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrel was not elected as the central character of the film because of its distinctive characteristics.
"She was the man who woke up this energy," she said.
“On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she was in the foreground because when ”
You can feel its energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long been without camera cameras, but complex racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrel's gonna be on probation for closing the highway for two and a half years during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called a house, simply "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she went to Ferguson's streets full three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Two Salvadorian football players were disqualified for U.S. players ’ bite
The football players in El Salvador, Henry Romero and Darwin Seren, received long-term disqualifying for their incomparable behaviour.
During the fourth final game of the Golden Cup of the North and Central American Cup and the Caribbean (CONCAAF), the Salvadorians bit United States players.
Henry Romero's attorney was the first to be distinguished.
The El Salvadorian bit the attacker, Josie Altidore, and then pinched him by the chest.
Seren's paralegal then bit U.S. defender Omar González in his fine area.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with the American victory at 2:0, passing on Goal.com.
Similarity: The artist creates DNA portraits of Chelsea Manning
In the middle of the hall at Freedman Gallery in New York, people's faces are hanging from the ceiling on the wire -- white, black and brown, all of which are incomprehensiblely similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were painted by the artist Heather Dewey-Harborg with brush strokes and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Levenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst serves a 35-year term for the famous transmission of sensitive diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called "The Origin of Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, information technology and art, and Manning, a female transsexual and famous dissident, by whom Barack Obama reduced his sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
Having analysed and used a computerized DNA program from Manning to create three-dimensional portraits of individuals who could have been identified with such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a profound, albeit difficult, manifesto on not only the plasticity of DNA data, the different interpretations and the infectious determinism of those interpretations, but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but who had openly stated since his youth that he was a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Law on spying, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs in the prison were not available, so only one of her photographs was known: the grainy black and white selves, where Manning in the platinum shade of the steam clearly felt uncomfortable driving a car; she was associated with this photograph.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed its 2012 project entitled “The Visions of Strangers”.
In it, the artist produced portraits of unknown people by means of forensic evidence of the type of smoking and chewing cuts, by removing DNA from this garbage, and by creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey-Hagborg on a preliminary display of a new press exhibit.
At the time, Chelsea was not allowed to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison - sat muse became friends in correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a comic book called "Shrunk Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who illustrated how in the future the president would mitigate Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book was released proved to be a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in the military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and powerful, and it's opening up right now that Donald Trump has declared war on the people who reveal secret information to the government and he's inventing new ways to inflame the hostility on Twitter that he's supposed to soften.
When Dewey Harborg was asked what happened over time, she said, "There's no chance there's anything."
In an artist's statement on the gallery wall, the enormous signature of Manning below (with a heart in place of a point above "i" in her name) calls for an end to “automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the other side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar made out of pencils C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as an artist's scientific expression), Dewey Harborg was hoping to show how we all look amazingly similar, in any case, in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data is to be interpreted and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Harborg; its 2007 video "False Memories" is also displayed here.
"The DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the above-mentioned novel in comic books.
On it, the King-Cong Manning appears above the U.S. Correctional Chamber with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it says.
"So never shut up."
"It's a direct quote from a letter she wrote me," says an artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I've still got leather ants when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not yet seen an exhibition in person -- as it was seeably depicted in comic books -- but when she comes, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genome symphony, gathered together like a crowd of protestors.
It's also done intentionally, like everyone at the exhibition up to the height (5'2, Manning's growth), where the pencil was painted with genetic haglogroups.
"I'd sooner put them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harborg about the portraits.
"I wanted them to look like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea as a movement that stood behind her release."
Professor of the University of Northwest and a member of the University of Oxford is looking for a police officer accused of murder
According to the police, there is a nationwide raid on Professor North-West University and a member of the University of Oxford who are wanted as suspects because of the death toll found in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the records of the Cook County Court, warrants were issued on Monday for pre-trial murder, without the right to be released on bail for 40-year-olds, Windem Latham and 50-year-old Andrew Warren, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, 20-year-old Cornell Duranlo died after he was subjected to multiple stabbing injuries.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was found on 27 July.
A call was received by the police, they came to the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell Duranlo was declared dead at the crime scene, and now detectives are investigating the death of knife wounds, considering her to be a murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwest since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was prohibited from entering the campuses of the North-West University.
“It is now a criminal matter under investigation by authorized persons and the University of Northwest cooperates with the investigation,” said Kabbah.
Warren is a senior finance officer at the University of Oxford.
A representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigation authorities”.
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to give up.
Police liaison chief Chicago Anthony Goulmie said he strongly advised suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have any idea of their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are increasing,” Gulelmi said.
According to Goulmie, local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Goulmie, the police officer called the Grand Plaza building administrator, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene a terrible one.
Goulmie reported that it was not clear whether the incident itself had occurred on 27 July.
According to him, the camera records confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were connected,” Gulelmi said.
The Grand Plaza published a message to the residents saying: “The police are currently working on the timeline of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic accident”.
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the VADA road map shortly."
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the terms of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented shortly.
“Some stage of compliance has been completed, RUSAD has been given the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Trafficking Agency).
The VADA road map has been updated accordingly," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the VADA road map for the restoration of conformity with the Code, which listed the conditions for the resumption of RUSAD and had recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could represent a problem for Russia.
"It has been announced, it will be implemented.
The results would be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly,” he added.
However, one of the requirements on the list implies that Russian Andiddoping structures must publicly accept the results of an investigation commissioned by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
On this point, Mutko said, "We are investigating, because our anti-doping system has been malfunctioning.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programmes, and we will not recognize what was not."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
On the morning of the same day, Smirnov, in an interview with Russia's Rport, acknowledged previous problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report without reservation," Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSAD from carrying out Doping control in November 2015 following the Doping scandal.
In June of this year, however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivier Niggly, stated that RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” towards the restoration of its work.
Fire was extinguished in the 79-story tower in Dubai
The big fire that took place in one of the world's highest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, is out of date, passes the Reuters.
It is noted that the fireman managed all hot spots by 4:00 local time (3.00 msk).
The local authorities reported that no one was injured as a result of the incident.
During the extinguishing of the fire, the streets adjacent to the sky were closed.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
The Torch, one of the highest buildings in the world, was previously reported to have been on fire in Dubai.
All the residents were evacuated in time.
Buzov's improbable dress is a fan's shock: panties that don't cover their pants.
Olga Buzová, the scandalal leading reality show, was impressed by the Europa Plus Live festival in her pants.
In front of thousands of worshipers, a newly declared singer with Nasty Kudri performed a song called "We Will Be Warm."
Both girls came on stage with provocative "brands" sewn up in such a way that they saw a singer's underwear.
The trousers were labeled Buzowa and Kudry.
Previously, it was reported that a specialist from a Moscow plastic surgery clinic commented on changes in the appearance of Buzova.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported by Radio 4 on Friday, 4 August, with reference to foreign media.
He said that it was the Russian authorities who were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO Gensel also criticized Russia for the Crimea situation and “destitution in eastern Ukraine”.
Stultenberg assured, however, that dialogue with Russia was possible and that no participant would benefit from further escalation of the situation.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that US-Russian relations were dangerously low and accused the United States Congress of doing so.
Ekaterinburg Metro is developing a new way of paying
In October, travel in the Ekaterinburg Metropolitan will be possible to pay a bank card, said by Paul Vedernikov, CEO of OAO, in an interview with the Regional Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce into the 2018 World Cup the same system as other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want other fans, guests of the uniform, to take advantage of the subway by means of their bank cards, without getting badges or standing in line," he said.
The startups that will help your company not become another Uber.
Amy Herrett wanted to assess the satisfaction of her startup in e-commerce, but the surveys were not working.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, unconceived.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He was never consistent and objective,” told Herrett, manager of a 75-person company called Madison Red, which deals with e-commerce in hair care in San Francisco.
She therefore sought the assistance of third parties.
There is now a new kind of start-up in staff management that helps companies to understand how their staff feel.
By developing and licensing software, the purpose of which is to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to conduct rapid surveys, to contact certain teams and population groups, to offer staff anonymity and hotlines for complaints and, in some cases, to allow informers to pass top management and direct management.
“Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Redwood City startup whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
Herrett told me that she had gained a better understanding of what her staff thought and felt in the three years she had used Glint.
In addition to the rapid surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a company's thermal map and shows in visual form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low validation rating, which allows them to understand why.
Companies realize little that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they'll become another Uber, which was involved in a scandal when a former staff member published a post on a blog describing an aggressive environment in which those who complained were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, it's a desire to control the situation, an opportunity for profitable business.
According to the Internet portal “Let's talk about payments”, dedicated to financial technology, the global governance, regulation and conformity industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent startup from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect misconduct, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the face of the fall in Hubert's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tella.
The Uber has recently appeared among clients.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send individual-ordered staff surveys, collect confidential real-time responses and monitor thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the head office.
“The court of public opinion has taken over the authority of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinn, founder and president of Convercent.
If it is found that the company has been mistreated by staff members or has acted immorally, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may have costly consequences in the form of boycotts by clients, staff outflows and lawsuits, Quinn reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 institutions, has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that staff are aware of the rules and procedures and to offer an easy way to approach the company's head office.
In the past, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or an email of the head office, file an official complaint and hope that she or she would be seriously affected.
Often it was a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, director of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to monitor staff complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states — such as discrimination, harassation and unfair pay — can be discovered and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff members,” said Vitrano, who leads a risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
“And we protect our shareholders from judicial proceedings with staff.”
According to Queensland, companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values and involvement of staff members in 2002, after Arthur Andersen failed due to ethical irregularities resulting from Dela Enron.
But it was only when social networks became widespread that companies realized that they could not keep their dirty laundry from spreading virus on the network.
“Before we start using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both the “Glint” and the “Convercent” offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for the use of their products.
It's a business model and it's an opportunity that's been approved by venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interrelated nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today ' s staff expect more from their jobs than before.
In markets with fierce competition, such as the Silicone Valley, high wages and interesting projects, it is only a necessary minimum.
Staff members want to feel accepted and appreciated, and they devote their time to a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work with a company, they feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do brings results, they are more likely to make such a company a success,” says Nina McCuin, Vice-President for Global Benefits and Satisfaction in LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors get income when business from their portfolio goes well; business goes well when employees are loyal and engaged.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase staff loyalty and engagement, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to cultural professionals in the workplace, it is important to have data on staff involvement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if the company asks staff for feedback, it may give the impression that changes are coming.
And if changes don't happen fast enough, or if they don't happen at all, frustration can develop and staff will lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you should be prepared to hold 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rat, president of the management consulting firm Kotter International, who had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will say, "Did you really hear me?
Don't you care?
And if you don't care, why don't I care?"
According to Herrett, Madison Red, which now conducts monthly staff surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after gathering feedback from staff who were not satisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday receives new knowledge about its staff and hopes that in the long run, it will be better able to retain staff in an industry known for its high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt is discovered on the Krasnoarmaya Avenue.
At Barnaul, decisive measures were taken to address the cause of the asphalt failure in the Krasnoarmaya Avenue.
The place where the holes appeared twice on the newly falsified carriageway (the crossing with the youth street) is decided to “cover”.
We will recall that a small section of the road near the trams was destroyed because the land had been settled in an area of an unexploited unexploited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Vice-Chairman of the City Committee on Road Administration, Modernization, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for detailed survey and elimination of the conditions for collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the re-establishment and concreteization of the depths of unprofitable communications will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the capital city.
The Bruins team has to do longer because the National Student Sports Association cancelled the training twice a day
Time is approaching 11:00 p.m.; a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles is being delayed to chat on one side of the new training fields of the campus team.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts, exposed their backs that glistened with sweat after the busy first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these moments of idleness take a break in the middle of the day.
The players on the summers, after three hours of training, will go back to the dormitories to prepare for the final exams and return to the Wasserman football centre the next morning to meet at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, the coach of Bruins Jim More said, "The next three days these guys are waiting for meat."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled the training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on the players, actually extended their day’s work — at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
So the start of the first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to be placed in the already dense schedule of players.
The side effect of the lack of two trainings a day has been more days with one training, and Bruins is moving towards the camp for almost a week than last year and conducting exercises during summer school for the first time in the six seasons of the Sea in Vestwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 trainings by 20 August, inclusive, before starting formal preparations for the first game in the season against the Texas University team A&M in September.
Mora said that he supported the change in the rules of the National Student Sports Association, even though another point appeared in the tight schedule of players.
“In three or four days, we give them this enormous burden, this is a serious trial,” Maura said.
"And they've just overcome it, they work, they're great guys.
I think that when we get to Saturday and have more time, it'll really be great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will close the training; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel, which has already been bombed with football balls over the safety net behind the gates.
The Bruins players have to occupy the hotel since this weekend, but Maura admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” Maura said.
“This is a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger of someone taking a room, sitting there and recording the training on video.
If you have video recording of practice, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security in parking number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in Petersburg are released from hospitals
All victims of the attack in St. Petersburg's subway in April were released from hospitals.
This was reported in the press office by Vice Governor Anna Mitianina.
According to data at the end of July, there were three people left in the hospital, transmitting TV to the Centre.
We'll recall the explosion in St. Petersburg's subway on April 3rd this year.
The bomb blew up the suicide bomb Acbarjon Jalilov.
The terrorist attack killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In criminal cases, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
It will be recalled that, the previous day, Roswanadzor recommended that the Metropolitan Peterburg revise the transport safety plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook is increasing the fact-waiting in the fight against the fair news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of myths to independent experts and show their conclusions under their original posts, and on Thursday the largest social network of the world is trying to fight so-called fair news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible myths, to send them for verification and, possibly, to show the results of a fact-finding post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways in which so-called fair news has been disseminated, which many believe has influenced the 2016 presidential elections in the United States.
This issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the September elections, they expressed support for the plan to fine social networks if they did not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing a new fact-of-chiking algorithm that had been launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what reports are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and share," wrote Sara Sue, Facebook News Manager in her block.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the "bound articles" function and work on other changes in the news feed to address the problem of fair news.
Create a novel comic book: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in a music video called "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s it served as a shelter for Margaret Tatcher.
But for 700 years from his cozy place in the Byul Valley in Kent County, he was watching a violent story around him, and now he inspired Jamie Rods, a Yorkshire-headed, hard-headed, history-oriented, comic-com.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he said with encouragement.
"You feel that way when you hold this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian Era and tells of families who lived in Scotty; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists, Isaac Lankevic, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rods' first book, which is based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote "Deads and Other Stories" -- a collection of British Library records; this project suddenly touched him to the depths of his soul.
"I could have been touched by just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the cocoa," he says.
"It's his finger fingerprint."
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days, light was lit.
And 300 years later, in the future, you feel like you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a person who is so passionate about old papers, it seems too good to be true to get support from the National Foundation and the English Art Council.
Rhodes studied the Victorian Castle all day, walked through the archives and considered numerous treasures of name and old things - for example, gyenium heads on walls or bottles that had been torn for centuries.
He went through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talked to the forestmen, gardeners, and sometimes artists who worked on illustrations of his book.
Then at night, he "drinked whiskey and sat down writing."
The history of Scotty's castle was not well understood, because the National Fund had full access to it only in 2006 when Elizabeth Hassy, the last heir, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had just begun to deal with the archive, which he described as “that the aristocrats had fallen to the attic for centuries”.
Diary days, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what they had: "You think land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but that's what two families fought for.
It's true, guys!"
In some of the history of the castle collection, it becomes the starting point for wider research in English history: for example, in "Worker's", the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Cristian Revolution.
“There are reports of the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380 in a book called “Kenta and Sassex German Families”, says Rhodes.
"The peasant rebellion started in these places, and I thought that rebellion was a good start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle, such as "The Priest", which tells of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family had been hiding in their home for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Smuggler", about the 18th-century smugglers Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stoning the tomb (which was discovered a few years later when the tomb was dug).
The Darrels are Rods' favorite family of all the people who lived in Scotty, "The gentlemen seemed to be perfect, they were always in debt, and they spent money on things they couldn't afford.
The Darrell men have dealt with their debt problems by marrying rich older women, and I think of them as a company of pretty guys who can look after the great estates."
When the castle is completed, Rhodes is looking for other ways to gain unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in a Finnish silence where he wrote a graphic novel about Eliamyak, a place where there was a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, and then it grew again with a forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"I felt like this: hell, I have to go back to reality."
Fifteen of the largest banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alphabank, Gazprombank, Rosselhosbank, Binbank and FK “Opening”, seven other credit organizations are about to withdraw from this public organization.
Thus, organizations that have withdrawn from the ARB would account for at least 80 per cent of the market.
But this is not just a solution - all banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization bringing together credit institutions - the Russia Regional Banks Association, led by the prominent politician Anatoly Aksakow, the Chairman of the Financial Market Committee, recognized, by the way, as a result of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and deputy for the number of bills drafted.
The outbreak of the conflict within the ARB was the result of a discussion in the Federation Council when new bills, such as new classification of banks according to the size of the capital statute, were considered by the Interregional Banking Council.
Garegín Tosunyan, President of ARB, then stated that the Association believed that the bill was passed for the benefit of the largest banks, which thus sought to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which Tosunyan believed was not always valid for the withdrawal of licences from some banks, which was, in fact, the result of an objection by the representative of the CB: many bank leaders, such as Exprombank, were members of the ARB governing bodies.
It seems that this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and becomes a visible occasion for the 15 largest banks, in disagreement with ARB policy, to begin to prepare themselves for joining the Russia Association, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB is low and constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually taking place”.
It's better for the contributors.
What's going to happen?
To answer immediately the main question that arises in or near a bank failure or conflict: investors are not at risk, but rather the credibility of the banking system will be enhanced.
The Russian Federation is headed by Anatoly Aksakov, a high-level specialist known for his carelessness in the interests of banks and their clients, highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the CB is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert assessments of the “regionals”.
In terms of human resources and organization, there is clearly no particular shock.
There is no doubt that ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation after such powerful and influential participants have been deprived of their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, there is considerable potential in this oldest organization, established in 1991 to promote the interests of the banking community, to continue to improve banking legislation and the general scope of monetary treatment.
Nor can it be said that Russia's open arms association is ready to accept new members on any terms, according to the reaction of its leader, Anatolia Aksakova (“may be too much to want”), who, on 21 July, at a briefing in the press centre of the Parliamentary Gazette, stated that “just the next day, representatives of the banks leaving the ARB asked me to consider developing the potential of our Russia Association”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Council of Association and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
A negotiating process is under way, the proposals of both parties are being examined, and an agenda for an extraordinary Congress of the Association is being prepared to be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll be.
Also, Anatoly Aksakow, after stressing that “the chair does not hold fast”, described George Luntowski as the possible new head of the renewed Russian Association, who leaves the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, giving high regard to his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to suspend his leave for one day and to arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Russia Association Council, which is scheduled to consider the agenda for the extraordinary Russian Congress.
The entry of petrol-fuelled vehicles into major Russian cities will not be restricted
The Deputy Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nicholas Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-fuelled vehicles into Russia ' s major cities would not yet be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that the environmental class should be progressively improved.
And there's a concept of zero emissions right away.
I don't think we're technically ready to do this.
The question is, since what year?
That's the same phrase at the level of slogans - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
"In 20 years -- I don't know, maybe that's what's going to happen," says the Minister's Prime.
Previously, the newspaper Izvedia reported that, by 17 August, the Vice-Prime Minister, Arcadiu Borković, had been mandated to examine the proposals for possible options for electric power transfer submitted to the Government by the Director of PAO Kamaz Sergey Kogogin.
Among the suggestions, according to the newspaper, is the use of vehicles with FDS in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting credit cards.
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that a new US immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the rules for getting a Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two Houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so in the light of a change in the way in which the U.S. gives credit cards to foreign citizens.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide an advantage to English-speaking candidates who have money to support themselves and skills to benefit our economy,” said Trump, according to the United States media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should bother us.
We haven't had time to think that 2017 can't get worse, there's a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots.
Yeah.
Sex robots are now the focus of attention.
The Foundation for Responsible Robots (FRR) has recently issued a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharka, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the eye color of robots, the shape of the nipples, and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about this, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and we'll soon see a lot more," said Akki in introducing the new report.
Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflated fellow workers to robots with silicon skin, warm to the senses, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also “adjust” their robots by choosing from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have "personality" by which the Stepford wife would be very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicon skin.
For example, RealBotix Robot allows users to adjust the quality they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxy Gold's sex robots, developed by the "True Company", which are provided with an already programmed identity - for example, "The Cold Farra" seems shy, and "Discussion Wendy" has a "cautious" character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that fits yours", and it's enthusiastically reported on "True Company."
So she loves what you love, doesn't like what you don't like, and so forth.
She's having a change of mood over the course of the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may be "in the mood"!
In the emergence of sex robots, there's a lot of concern -- not least because they replace real human relationships -- but most of all concern is the subordinate image of a woman, the association with rape that causes the possession of the cold (read: resistant) Farah.
The "True Company" site compares Roxxy to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman has a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex and submission as an option supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the margins of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the peripheral can be very educational about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are neither stupid nor aggressive until a free market allows them to do so.
It's no coincidence that these complex sex robots came about when women's rights around the world were threatened when the president in the White House boasted of being attached to women.
The most scary thing about "The Servant's Race" series is not graphic images, twisted bodies and dejected eyes, which is how realistic this vision seems to be.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem that big right now.
The aim of the sex robots industry is to achieve the physical likeness of real women (only with the proportion of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like people to feel, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's not like robots look like real women.
They cannot break up with or leave their partners.
They don't have a life or a life story -- nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful rabbis.
Or, as they say in 2017, female servants.
A member of Los Angeles Eugene (Puch) Jeter, who has been in favour of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the basketball championship in Europe, the final part of which begins on 31 August.
Andrey Swanev, the general manager of the Blue-Yellows, reported this to the BeBasket portal.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come for family reasons.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
I recall that with the direct participation of Jeter, Ukraine's collection took the highest sixth place on Eurobasket-2013 and first hit the world basketball championship, where the yellow-blue was unable to overcome the group stage and the U.S. native took 15.4 points on average, made 3 sets and gave 5 broadcasts.
Jeter has ceased to speak in favour of Ukraine since we resigned from the post of chief coach of our national team, the American team Mike Fratello, who resigned in 2015.
The male Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Finland, Turkey, Romania and Israel.
The Ukrainian team will play their team tournaments on Earth with a promise.
Trusted Eugenia Murzin, group B, will have five team members: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our male team held two check-ups, which gave way to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Tramp's great feat?
I think it's very reasonable to act like Mita Romney.
In the Trump era, it was common for political disputes that polarized the American electorate to break up at microlevel some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, U.S. newspapers wrote down columns about how to deal with the terrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're about to burst.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I am writing about this because my cousin, the left-wing poet of Chicago, who had been on knives with Republicans in her family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that joining in the fight against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
At Trumpe in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother, with whom she argued about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely ended up on the same side.
At dinnertime, that is certainly good; but I cannot help but think that in the broader context, it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed forces into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean that it's unlikely that one day we'll stop hitting his exits.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump is “normalizing” the right-wing republicans, who, against the background of its standards, suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I realized that I miss Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness today with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like) - compared to Trump and both of them seem like a very small evil.
When Trump is gone, the next Republican candidate will just be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the central park carousel -- the biggest carousel in the Parks Department of New York and the best way to spend three dollars in town if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the glass-glass images on the central drum -- the thunderous clowns and the animals, who look in horror at their backs -- are extremely ominous, and the music that goes off is strange.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: skyscrapers are getting out of date, silhouettes of buildings are too busy to be awe - inspiring, and the reality of the city is short of dreaming.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day when I learned that the Suisse Cottage area is not really a Swiss shale.
And the carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two, a child of eleven and two women can have an excellent time in forty.
If I could put carousels on the score, I'd put a five, but fortunately, no one asked me to do it.
And in the department store this week, I was asked to do a terminal card assessment of my shopping experience on a scale of one to five stars.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's still plus the option to have 15 percent of the teas scored at the counter.
As a result, not only is the neutral interaction slowing down, but it also has to be personalized in a situation that does not imply it.
The poor storegirl in the department store smiled inconsolably while I was tired of evaluating my experience in giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain
Pistorius is leaving prison because of a visit to a doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which the prison authorities claimed he had received as a result of his fall into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office for an initial sentence for an unintentional murder.
He killed Stancamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting at her several times through the door of the toilet room at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he took his friend for a night thief hidden in his toilet.
The Public Prosecutor's Office has declared its intention to protest again, this time against the six-year term of Pretoria, which she claims is too soft.
The Attorney-General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be heard this year.
The period of Pretoria could be extended by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor ' s Office was successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
A non-departure subscription was selected for the alleged beating of a NTV journalist
The capital law enforcement officers chose a preventive measure in the form of a non-departure certificate for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razjav during a live broadcast from Gorkoy Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS, with reference to Irinu Volk, official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
“In the context of an investigation into a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Congo (“Bobbies”) against a 32-year-old man who attacked the person of a correspondent of a television channel in the Gorki Central Park of Culture and Recreation, the suspect was given a preventive measure in the form of a certificate of non-departure and proper conduct”, specified Volk.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative report had been prepared against the suspect for police disobedience.
On Wednesday, 2 August, a man approached the correspondent while he was on direct air for WWD Day and hit his face.
As it later turned out, the hooligan has nothing to do with the VWN.
In fact, according to Razzaev himself, the agents tried to arrest Moscow.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tenting
According to a report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tenting.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people who had set up tents in a fixed place, including two Bulgarians, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released the same day, while the consequence is still coming.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the BBC TV channel that Bulgarian citizens had been released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping and have already imposed serious fines on all who are caught while parking in a non-existent place.
The audits will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court could impose a fine.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia accused the U.S. Vice-President of rhetoric during the cold war.
Statements made during the European tour of the United States Vice-President Michael Pens were criticized by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“It has to be noted with regret that Washington is getting deeper into the primitive ideological images of the cold war, which are totally devoid of reality”, says a statement by the Russian foreign policy department.
For example, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pens' words about the "Russian threat" and the attempts to force the crossing of the borders he had told in Podgorica were echoed.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out the destructiveness of the choice “or with the West or with Russia” and the implausible notion of the alleged non-alternative entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to reject Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“We call upon United States colleagues to end Russia's plenum and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and a willingness to work together in a constructive way, on mutual interest”, states the statement of the Russian MIDA.
Feldsher was injured in an ambulance accident in Podmoskovy.
The accident occurred in the Locust Stupino, resulting in a stroke of the Inomarca with an ambulance in the first place.
Today, about 08:10 msk, Mitsubishi's car was hit by an ambulance in Stupino, Moscow.
“The fast-track car was turned over as a result of the impact,” said TASS in the media service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow.
Law enforcement officers work on the scene, and the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In Odessa, a woman dropped her newborn son on the construction site, turning him into a cellophane bag.
On the evening of 3 August, a local resident reported to the Division of Police that he had found a package with a baby in a broken private house.
“The law enforcement officers and doctors who promptly brought the child to a medical facility went to the scene of the incident”, reported in the Odessa Head of the National Police.
The doctors found that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of a umbilical cord.
A 36-year-old local woman was identified by the priority operational activities.
It is also established that a woman has three more children.
As noted in the headmaster, the family had not previously been placed under the supervision of law enforcement personnel and had not been particularly sensitive.
The circumstances and reasons for the conduct are currently identified by the police, followed by a procedural decision.
The infant is now under medical supervision.
As previously reported, in Nicolaus, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into the garbage pipeline.
Gregory Leps: "I'm breaking into battle, though 55 isn't 30. "
One of the most successful Russian essay artists, Gregory Lepp, will celebrate his 55th anniversary on Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke to the bearer of the story.
I remember seeing your "tantine."
A special tent in the Slaws, Gloria Heinor sings for a birthdayr, a powerful saluter over Moscow River.
You must have wondered how you wanted to spend your next five-year-old.
Did your plans come true?
Speaking of a profession, it was a good time.
I've been working a lot, and I've spent three times with tours all over the country, giving 120-130 concerts a year.
I made two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what we say 20 years ago.
Biological clocks won't lie.
Drinking like I sang at 30 is getting harder.
Still, I'm breaking into a fight, and I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm on a different level.
You're with them and you're recording a new album, first in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it right now.
Actually, we've all recorded it in my studio, and now we're gonna send it to the L.A. facility.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" on a single-name song written with Timothy.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't taught her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we make a video on it.
And we'll introduce the album in November to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
The great American drummer Chris Coleman has put his hand on your new record.
Do you think you wanted to attract him to your garage?
I think Coleman is one of the world's greatest drummers today.
He came to my studio, recorded his lot.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a famous drummer involved in various projects).
But for long-term work in Russia, they set up, to say the least, excessive conditions.
It was about a dollar of 35,000 to 45,000 a month.
Then I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found Max Malishev's great drummer.
Actually, it's better to feed yours.
Sometimes I want to go to any one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fédor Dosumov is highly listed internationally.
Western music magazines are written about him, and he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists has arrived, with another performing technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you can't come to the United States alone?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, to be honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get to America.
I've said I'm studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful you are.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that experience, schools.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not been faced with the challenges that American musicians have always faced.
They were striving for the best quality of communication.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Great Britain has denied me 10 years' entry.
But I'm still going to apply for a visa every year to the British Embassy so I can go back and work there.
The rest of Europe is favorable to me.
And by August, you're planning to have a concert in Monaco, not a registered concert, right?
Yeah, Monte Carlo has a good Sports Hall, and I was there once.
Now they've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the concert tickets are already broken.
At the Randeva Lyma Wykule, which will start on July 20th in Jurmala, will you go?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyme is a great singer and a great woman who has the ability to present herself and a beautiful wax and even whispers.
After the tours and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to Vladimir Wiesotsk's work.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When's the third coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be quite different.
I want to record about 80 or 90 songs of Ussotsky in the same feed as he did himself.
Just the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangements.
I'll have our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I'm going to try to get me involved in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how he's doing.
You and Boris Grebenskev's songs gradually entered their repertoire.
Why don't you write down his album later?
Boris Borisovich is an excellent man and an excellent musician.
I've been crossing with him a few times and I've been asking, "Can I sing some of his song?
He said, "Grigory, I write songs for them to be fulfilled."
Please try, sing.
I think it's interesting to write down an album like this.
As long as I don't have a job like this, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might be doing a project like this.
If you don't focus entirely on your production center.
I suppose until you realized his potential, you didn't sign contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're independent, well-beinged people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Seresha is a brilliant singer, I've invited him.
I can disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he's got his own development strategy.
And now in my center, there's Alexander Panayotov, who I led at the Voice.
We've made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, these singers are rare.
It would be most unfortunate if he did not reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to pick him up with a repertoire, and I'm taking off the music videos.
I hope so.
And I'm also trying to advance other artists at my center: buying songs, crying to poets, sometimes their tracks get turned by television and radio channels.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They're going to get a recording album, a few clips.
And then if they want to, they can go their own way, and I won't insist that they pay back their money.
Although it would be nice for me to have one of them make a commercial success and pay me the interest we agreed to in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, try, prove how I used to prove it.
If you're offered tomorrow a tour of Ukraine and are guaranteed entry into the country, will you?
I'm still invited there.
These are mainly closed-circuit activities.
And as for the big tour...
I'm a man of my country, a Russian, and I'm convinced to fly to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say we have to fly to some other point in the interest of the State, I'll fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that this has been the case with Ukraine.
Because I think we are one people and must be together.
I'm sorry it's not going to work, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We've seen it like anywhere.
Thank you very much.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorac, Light Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, there is a mass of gifted people, and it is a sincere regret that they are now unable to reach out fully to a wide Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I'd love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slava Wacarchuk, and have a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at the moment...
Andrei Ohlopkova was dropped from the cosmodrome
As has been known, the technical director of the East Andrei Oholakkov cosmodrome began work at the Khrunikov State Space Science and Production Centre (HCNPC).
In the past, he had been de facto building the East Cosmodrome, but because of differences with the management of the Land and Space Infrastructure Operations Centre (CECI), he had been transferred to an enterprise in Moscow Philia, where he would coordinate production.
Mr. Ohlopkov's replacement will not be available: the post of Technical Director is likely to be abolished and the function is scattered by CECI units.
That the Technical Director of the Eastern and Deputy Director of CENCI for Technology Development, Andrei Ohlopkov, took up work in the KNPC Khrunikov, the top managers of several space industries, as well as a government staff member, told him.
"He's been in the new post for weeks," the "James" interviewers in the industry have clarified.
It was not possible to obtain the CENCI operational comment on Thursday, and Mr. Olopkov himself was not available for comment.
However, the information “UX” was officially confirmed in the GNPC.
He decided to move to the post of Director of Production Coordination, said at the company.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to work in CENKI in 2013, serving in space troops, in particular Baikonura, and in Pleseck, he served as the first deputy commander in the rank of Colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Ohlopkov became a member of the criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: it was alleged that regional merchants had been received for retracted orders from the State, but that they had failed to meet their obligations to clean up the separate parts of the carrier missiles in the Archangelian region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The technical development responsibilities assigned to it in CECI have been extended to various projects, but the main one has been the construction of the long-term cosmodrome in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview with "Joseph", made clear that the situation in the East had been “critical as early as October 2013”.
The strategic error in the planning was that the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier rocket were planned for the same time and for the end of 2015.
In order to launch before the end of the year, the construction was completed six months earlier and the deadline was moved from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, CECI specialists have begun parallel installation of technological equipment at unstructured sites.
The main supporter of the idea was Andrei Ohlopkov.
Despite the risks and the actual transfer (in place of December 2015, the Union left only on April 28, 2016), this idea was justified, says the source on the launch site: “Unless we'd still run from the East, we'd be building”.
The Vice-Prime-Prime Minister of the Cosmodrome named Andrei Ohlopkova his "space Susan", but he was the one who almost always asked for information on the progress of the construction.
Mr. Ohlopkov was reminded of the fact that, for example, in the interview "Joseph", he had proposed that the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specströr) be removed as the only artist for the East and work directly with subcontractors, "Why do we have to put all the eggs in one Specialist basket?"
That idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CECI has assumed the responsibility of the general contractor to complete construction and installation work on the launch and technical complex by the fourth quarter.
According to the October data, Mr. Oholakkov ' s transition to a new job has led to disagreements with the CECI management on how to complete the construction of the cosmodrome facilities and complexes and how to work with subcontracting organizations.
"It has been decided that this will be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the building of the East.
A government officer, in turn, calls the decision strange: “He was one of the best professionals to find an equivalent replacement for him”.
According to the data, this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the launch will be abolished and its functions will be scattered by CECI units.
A two-profession programme will be available in music schools
In the future, pupils of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialities at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of Science and Education, the Ministry of Science and Education, Stavlov Golubenko, can be re-read to students of recurrent disciplines, and the question of paying for the rest of the second course is decided by special grants, which hands over the RIA News.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken over this issue, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow two occupations to take place, but at the same time will not conflict with existing legislation in the field of education,” said Golubenko.
Last Friday, at the Sunday Chat, Vladimir Putin and her students at the Sirius Children's Centre, a student, Maria Andreev, reported that she was forced to pay for recurrent subjects in the second field at the CMM at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was studying violin and piano classes and was awarded competitions in both directions.
The Head of State had recognized her question as very relevant and had promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian was detained on the wall
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man, Kirill N., is detained and, on the wall of the roof of a tall building, reports El Universal.
The incident took place in Mexico City's capital.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed a three-metre fence into the Nestle office complex and took it on his own to one of his towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or rope.
The young man was already on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security took him to the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
There it is determined whether the young man is legally present in the country.
Meanwhile, the video of a young man rising to a height has become popular in the network.
Users called the young man "spider-man."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help to ease the OVC.
Red meat and chocolate are commonly considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: A diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of intestinal inflammation.
It is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, resulting in cripples and stomach swelling, chronic or blood loss, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although meat and dairy products are usually recommended to alleviate symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of the protein tryptofan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colónna, explained that intestinal immune cells ensure that harmful microbes from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of starting an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance while protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance is too severe for inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The experiments showed that mice with a certain bacteria in their intestines have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs tryptofan, one of the building blocks of protein, to start these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We've established a connection between one type of bacteria, Lactobaccillus reuteri, which is part of the normal intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptofane was contained in mice' diet, the more immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work for people: a combination of L. reuteri and triptofan-rich diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the intestine.
Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, after studying the variety of immune cell tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells and another group that belonged to the same line but was kept separately, had no them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by intestinal microbioms of mice, bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the stomach tract.
The DNA of the mouse intestine cells has been segregated and six types of bacteria present in mice that have immune cells but are missing from mice that do not have them have them have been detected.
Mice grown in a sterile environment without a good microbiomy and without developing this type of immune cell have been given L. reuteri, and they have immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in the liquid environment and then transferred small amounts of fluid, without bacteria, to undeveloped immune cells released from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of triptofane processing known as indol-3-milic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tryptofan into mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptofan was halved, the number of cells also dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have cells that are as tolerant as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their stomach tract.
It is not known whether the byproducts of triptofane from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans as well as in mice, but in humans suffering from intestinal inflammatory intestinal diseases, defects were found in the genes associated with tryptofan.
She says, "Maybe we need to strengthen the development of these cells because these cells are dependent on inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines.
High levels of tryptofan, if available, may potentially increase their population.”
According to José Moureenho, Manchester United hired a “gny” in the person of Nemania Matić
Manchester United hired a “gny” in the person of Nemania Matić, and considers José Moureenio after the defender debuted in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, who had acquired 40 million pounds from Chelsea, began with a victory at 2-1 in Dublin in the last U.N.A. Pre-Seclosure match in front of Superb WheFA v. Real Madrid on Thursday and gave an impression of being a para-protector, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke out when they were satisfied.
However, since Matić had not participated in the pre-seasonal tour of Chelsea in Asia, he was seriously lacking the preparations for the game and had endured only 45 minutes, which Moureen said required further development before the pre-premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks, he thinks with football," said Moureen.
“We will help him prepare sooner than later.”
Like Matić, his new comrades, Victor Lindelof and Romela Lukak, began playing at Aviv's stadium when Moureen started to form his main members by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Moureenio wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for having acquired three of the four,” he added.
“I will rejoice even more if they make me four of the four of them, but they have already tried very hard for me.”
The former leaders of the social democracies of Lithuania are forcing them to remain in the ruling coalition.
The former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, the ex-Primés Algiardas Butkjavicus and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Seimas Social Democratic Party, Chelovas Jurchenas, appealed to the same party to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the Parliament Gazette, because of tensions with partners - the Union of peasants and Greens - discussions have been initiated in the Social Democratic Party as to whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
The three senior experienced companions wrote to the same party with an open letter, which stated, inter alia: “The frustration of the Party's comrades with the results of the elections is understandable, but the coalition with the peasants has created for us, however not very easy, but the conditions for the further realization of the social justice goals that are envisaged by our initiative in the Government's programme and for the preservation of the political domination of the left centre over the right parties.”
In the view of former party leaders, the discussion so far “has been dominated by an emotion-based expression of opinion without specific arguments”.
The authors of the letter fear that the thoughtless actions of their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
The disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
Mosgord reduced the sentence of a wheelchair invalid, Anton Mamav, from four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
In the past, the convicted person was released from SIZO by a decision of the Timirasev court.
Mosgorud confirmed, however, that the accused was a criminal because he had set up a robbery and the kidnapping of a motorist from a former Special Forces soldier.
Mosgarud reduced Anton Mamav's sentence to 200,000 roubles.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and therefore such a person must be prosecuted”, explained “Happily” by the Spokesperson of Mosgors Ulyan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account the health of Mamaev, the factual circumstances of the case and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which punishment could be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Majev Vasili Serostanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would justify a change in the severity of the act and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he was not satisfied with the decision of Mosghursud.
I'm disappointed with the court decision.
The only legitimate solution would be justification, intent on continuing to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not rule out appeals against the sentence to the Court of Cassation of Mosgord and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights,” he said.
Remember, a 28-year-old Moscowman named Anton Mamaev, who suffers from spinal muscle atrophics, became a member of a criminal case in the fall of last year.
A disabled person claims he bought a scooter from a friend for 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, the owners of the motorist, including the former Special Forces fighter, stated that the disabled and his assistant, Vasili Serostan, had taken their property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Chimirazev District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasili Serostan to three years of the colony and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years of imprisonment serving a sentence in a general regime colony (art. 162, para. 2).
After the disabled person was placed in SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Office of the Attorney-General, the Commissioner for Human Rights of President Tatyana Moskalkov, joined the case.
As a result, Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO in mid-July by a decision of the same Timirasev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgord.
The UNF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The final “Forum for Action” of the National People's Front of Russia (OF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, informed the “Evidents” of the source of the FNL and confirmed the leader of the executive committee of the Alexei Anismov movement.
According to him, the Forum's outcome is to prepare a report to the President on national environmental issues and to propose a strategy to address them.
The Izvidi's interlocutors in the FNL note that the report to the Head of State will contain a “deep analysis” on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the History, the final forum of the UNF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date has not yet been determined - it is usually aligned with the President ' s schedule, which is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key activities of the FNL.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts, in Rostov-na-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will also formulate systemic proposals to address environmental problems, as described by the “Study” interviewer in the FON.
The Co-Chair of the Central Headquarters of the Movement of Olga Timofev, who is chairing the Committee of State on Environment and Environmental Protection, reported that “phrothonics” would report to the Head of State on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of the Environment in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the UNF's “Forum for Action” are likely to be combined.
During the year, we grew up to be a powerful team of environmental experts, saw legislative gaps and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of a report that we are preparing for the President as leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the “fronts” are also reporting on the work on the priority projects of the UNF, as described by Olga Timofeev's “Evidents”.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environment, environment and transport, Sergei Ivan, would also be invited to the forum.
Previously, he had participated in the MOF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of the Environment will go into history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they can work for years.
To keep these questions on the agenda, added Olga Timothyev.
Andrey Kolyadin, Head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), noted that in raising environmental issues, the UNF is acting on the presidential agenda.
Many things they have offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the President,” said Andrey Kolyadin, the "Evidents".
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded at this time, which could give the regions additional impetus for development.
In the future, the regions will be able, with the help of the EPF, not only to solve their environmental problems but also to develop ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by a “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about a garbage dump in Balashich (already closed) and coal dust in the port of Navotka (the bill on the prohibition of open-transmission of coal in settlements, one of the authors is Olga Timofev).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been established, the issue is further enforcement practices, as well as the position of civil society.
There is a need for a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State - the head of the philanthropic Foundation, Leonid Bochin.
HRC member HRC, leader of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergei Ziplenkow, in his conversation with the "Izvestites", stressed that responsible social and business approaches are needed to solve environmental problems successfully, while legislative efforts alone are limited.
As soon as society and business realizes that solving environmental problems is a much more strategic step, the situation will change, said Sergey Ziplenkov.
The expert stressed the need to reverse the trend that the violation of environmental law was a cost-effective solution for business.
A British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and a car to blow his hand.
A British inventor was the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office, and even start a car with a simple hand held.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northham used a tiny chip between his thumbs and indexes, and now, through his firm BioTek, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives at the expense of technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from King's Office in Winchester, to ensure that the implementation procedure was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is similar to a microchip used by cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northham also replaces locks in houses and cars with a 300-pound-a-centre-for-one-lock chip.
The married father of a child has already installed technology in his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House report cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to the records of the military forces provided by the magazine TIME, last month ' s White House decision to force the Marine Helicopter into the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers $24,000.
The white and green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Martin One, when the president is on board, became a central element of the 17 July White House event that showed American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pens and top officials of the White House examined technological products from all fifty states.
A helicopter in Connecticut was displayed next to a yacht from the state of Man, a fire truck from Visconsin, and a vehicle truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the control of the helicopter, the White House Military Authority ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO", only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of the "unusual" event.
“I just wanted you to make sure you were aware of it because it was an unusual press event”, wrote the HMX-1 commander in an e-mail to his superior, the first Deputy Chief of Aviation of the Marine Corps, just prior to the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend the 3-hour event and remain there until the lawn is released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return the flight in accordance with the working hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, while the unit ' s guards remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the records received by the “TIME” magazine whether the second crew was required as a result.
The Hetch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the activity was in conflict with that decision.
“We asked, among other things, whether it was a violation of Hetch’s law, and we were told that it was not,” the commander wrote.
“It looks like you have nowhere to go”, the deputy said.
The event “Make in America” was declared official by the White House and was not covered by the Hetch Act.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the reform of the health sector, which was then drafted in the Senate, and commended efforts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly new.
The presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to ask them for one thing in the interest of photography.
Trump had already been discussed in February when the presidential plane had gone backwards during its first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and its Twitter account had been blocked by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor.
“White house in awe of the American screening of products from 50 states made by American American workers from American materials”, said Linda Walters, Deputy Spokesperson for the White House.
The HMX-1 crews often take training flights around Washington Agglomeration and the South Lawn to train the United States President's transportation to the White House with precision to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training missions at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight carried out for the event “Actioned in America” was counted to the crew on the basis of the required training flights per month.
The unit ' s helicopters on that day also flew 11 additional hours as part of “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in a demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not account for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the exercise.
But according to the Ministry of Defence temporary rates for fiscal year 2017, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records 30 minutes of aircraft in the air each way from its airfield based at the Quantico Marines Aeronautics Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“To calculate the value of taxpayers on the basis of an estimated rate of reimbursement is totally wrong,” says Walters.
“These indicative rates include personnel, services and many other irreversible costs, which are included in the annual appropriations.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by RENDC, rates of reimbursement do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, the former White House Press Secretary, Sean Spyser, spoke out to defend the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate this week things done in America,” Spice said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which has been worked so hard on by so many Americans.
It is, of course, appropriate to draw attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while watching the South Lawn during the event, but he was clearly sitting in the driver's seat in a fire car.
Inside the White House Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking the press about his own fleet of company products.
"I know "Sikorsky very well," said the president. "I have three."
Moscow will provide grants for intensive care units in urban hospitals
Every year, life-saving grants will be allocated to intensive care units and intensive care units of the capital medical clinic.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobinin, visited the Juda City Clinical Hospital.
During his examination of the clinic, he presented a letter of appreciation to Victor Procko, an orthopedic doctor, who was led by the most difficult operation for the reconstruction of the adolescent's feet.
Sergei Sobjane also described the decision to provide intensive care for urban clinics and intensive care units each year.
The funds will be directed towards encouraging doctors and nurses.
According to the capital city town hall, the Jewish Clinic Hospital is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment to enable its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the Columbia Rural Hospital.
At present, health units are designed to accommodate over a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and hospitalization, there are day offices.
The staff of the hospital is 2,800.
The total area covered by medical care is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the medical facility became a member of the short-term hospital pilot project (SCP).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
Surgical interventions use advanced medical equipment to significantly reduce the time frame for the rehabilitation of patients.
After surgery, they spend only a few hours in hospital.
In the first half of the year alone, 36,000 patients were provided with inpatient care at the Juda Clinic Hospital.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15800 operations to various degrees of complexity.
NBU reported that there were no buyers of the Ukrainian “daughter” Sberbank
In Nazbank, Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no requests to purchase a Ukrainian “daughter” from Sberbank.
This is reported on Friday, 4 August by the TASS, with reference to the representative of the NSA press service.
The NBU confirms that on 3 August 2017, Viktor Prokokeni, a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, obtained 100 per cent of Sberbank shares to agree on an indirect (through Paritetbank) acquisition.
“No documents have been received from other potential investors to buy Sberbank shares in the NSA”, the communication notes.
On 3 August, a Belarusian businessman, Victor Prokolenya, withdrew the request to purchase a daughter-in-law of Sberbank.
On 28 July, it was reported that Nazbank Ukraine had refused Russian businessmen Said Guceriev and Gregory Guselnikov the acquisition of the Ukrainian “daughter” Sberbank.
The regulator based its decision on the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank reported on the sale of his Ukrainian “daughter” to the Norvik Banka Consortium and to the private Belarusian company in March of this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, son of the Russian businessman Mikhail Güceriev.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
During the year, they were prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favour of mothers ' organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, as stated at the United Nations.
Elections can only be representative when all members of society, including women, are represented on Wednesday by the head of the UN mission to Afghanistan.
According to Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women run for provincial council elections, three women compete for the office of Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Selections can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial and presidential elections will take place in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threatened to disrupt the electoral process, which coincided with the transition of international forces from military operations to the role of advisers.
In this year ' s elections, power is transferred peacefully for the first time from one democratically elected Government to another.
Hayes stated that enhancing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghanistan Independent Electoral Commission, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

In Venice, fines for inappropriate behaviour were tightened for tourists
The Venice authorities have tightened the fines for bathing in canals from Euro50 to Euro500.
For walking around the city in a bath or naked tortoise, the fine will now be 200 euros.
The Euro100 will be required from those who will set up a picnic in a public place or cycle through pedestrian areas, and the TASS will be referred to by the Association of Tourists of Russia.
It is also mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for inscriptions on Euro400 and for garbage Euro25.
Travelers will be informed of the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice by means of a special company known as "EnjoyRespectVenezia" in social media, as well as through advertisements and posters on the city council website, on billboards and at the most large tourist gathering sites.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Venice tourism adviser Paola Mare, fines will be transmitted to home country embassies of violators to warn their compatriots of such errors.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she said.
In April, the Italian city administration reported plans to limit the traffic.
The number of tourists visiting the city centre is already well under way in Venice.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to observe the Festa del Renentore festival, only 60,000 guests were allowed to attend.
In addition, there is a moratorium on the establishment of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.

FF released Lake from the post of Chairman of the Committee
On Wednesday, the Federation Council endorsed the statement by the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Victor Lakeov, and released him from office.
He remains a senator from the province of Khabarow.
An application for release from the post of Lakes wrote last week.
He explained his decision to the need for rotation and his desire to “change the pace of life”.
The senator also noted that the decision to leave had not been immediate.
Victor Lake has since 1996 submitted to the FF a legislative meeting of the Khabarovski Province.

Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatya (East Siberia) for the establishment of fair tariffs for the use of electricity are beginning to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, the cost of electricity at low voltage for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the Decision of the Government of the Russian Federation on the amendment of the wholesale electricity and power market regulations and in the consolidated forecast balance between the production and supply of electricity (power) within the framework of the unified energy system of the Russian Federation for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation (No. 842), has established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryat.
As a result, the cost of electricity for drilling producers is reduced by a quarter, making life easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have beaten the thresholds of the Moscow Cabinets in futile attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkutsk region with that of the Angar hydropower cartridge emanating from Baikal, the main catchment area of which is Buryatia.
And it's not until this year that progress has begun.
In March, the electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from rouble 4.24 per cent to rouK 3.93 per cent, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by decision of the Federal Government in the list of areas of value areas of the wholesale market for which the operation of the wholesale and retail markets has been determined, industrial consumers have moved forward.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/hour 1.01 roubles.
But no one dares mention at least the approximate date of new tariff movements downwards for Buryatia.
The Office of the Attorney-General of Ukraine was not intimidated by Scoother and arrived in Crimea.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Catering Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in the McVité's factory in Glasgow
The Union requires guarantees from the managers of the McVitie's bisque manufacturer because of his long-term obligation to produce at the Glasgow factory.
The GMB Scotland office reports that the company was silent about the future investment at the Tokros facility.
There are more than 500 people working in a factory producing Hobnobs and Rich Tea, among other products.
Pladis, owner of McVité's, reports that over the past few years, it has invested more than 5 million pounds in the facility.
The company adds that in the event of any change in the work of the facility, the employees and representatives of the trade union “will be the first to know about them”.
In a letter to the head of the company, the GMB Scottish office requested McVité's response to the concern that funding would not be launched for the modernization of production lines.
The senior organizer, Drew Duffy, stated: “The members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the head of the facility on business needs and the investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross.”
Families have been working here for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in local society and in the territory of the Great Glasgow; this is a crucial pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brekzit, the growth of the subsistence minimum and the chronic decline in production, the East End Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of the McVité's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “the head of the Tokros facility only yesterday received a letter from the GMB Scotland branch, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with the staff and representatives of the trade union”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tokros with staff and representatives of the GMB, at which a number of issues were openly discussed.
We talked to staff about how, as all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic environment, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this applies to all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tokros facility, especially in production lines and improved performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in the event of any change in work on the site, the employees and representatives of the trade union will be the first to learn about it.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosneffti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petroleum Chemical Company (HNPC) should be connected to the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but no one would give instructions to the Gasprom, like Roznefti.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin ' s request to help resolve the conflicts.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosneftew and Gasprom should be determined solely on the basis of market principles.
Igor Sechin, chapter of Rosnephti, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said earlier that the lack of agreement with Gasprom on gas for WNHC jeopardizes the project's duration.
Sechin noted that dialogue with Gasprom on this issue was ongoing.
Gasprom offers to find gas resources from the Rozneffti perimeter, but we don't have such resources," Sechin added.
Recall that Rosnepht asked for permission to use gas from the Kyrina “Gazprom” field on the Sakhalin shelf for the East petrochemical Company.
In June, Gasprom stated that negotiations on this issue were continuing and there were “no sharp angles”.
Did SGW Barcelona warn of Neimar's transition three years ago?
A member of the La League may regret his interest in Marco Verratty
Parry St. German will not stop pursuing Neimar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record of the three years ago?
The compensation proposal reactivated the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was ready to break the world record at the cost of the transition, more than twice the previous mark of Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is over, Neimar will be the world's most expensive player, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, as SGW offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week clean.
It is known that Barcelona, rather than rage over the proposal, and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the Catalan club insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since he moved from Santos in 2013.
But has the football world been warned of such a possibility three years ago by the President of SPM?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best players in SPLM.
“I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll come against them, we'll make proposals to their players,” Al-Khaleifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences.”
Barcelona appears to have crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in Marco Verratty's semi-defense defender.
SWD made it clear that it would not release the Italian player under any conditions, and it is likely that Barcelona is now experiencing the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neimar.

They described the work done to clean up the lake.
The boys were then shown in an open container next to a container that had been prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin released a few boys from his sledge.
Then I pulled a special lever on the cover of the container and released the others.
Also during the visit, the leader commissioned the environmental situation on Baikal and built a road on the island of Olhoon.
According to the Ministry, one volume is required and the other volume is supposed to be available.
"I want to figure out what actually happens to us with funding," the Russian leader stressed.
We will recall that during the 2017 forest fires, the population of Buryatya, Irkutsk region, and homes and constructions were destroyed.
