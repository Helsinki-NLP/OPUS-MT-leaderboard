Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that they will be “associated with maps”
Some people are frightened by the recommendation to change the title of their office to “member of the Parliament of Wales” (MWP).
This recommendation came out of plans to change the name of the assembly to "Parliament Wales".
A TIME of the entire political spectrum is concerned that it can provoke ridicule.
One watch from the Labourists claimed that his group was troubled by the rum from Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "unthinkable" and "pwp" means defecation.
A TIME from the Wales Party stated that his group was generally "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said that his group was "preconceived" about changing the name, but noted that MWP could quickly become a "mappet."
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to that of the Yorkshire English pronunciation "u".
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently developing legislation to change the name, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the assembly will certainly be made by the members themselves”.
The Wales Self - Administration Act of 2017 gives the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public debate on proposals, and the renaming of the assembly into Parliament in Wales was widely supported.
In terms of what we call "Tah", the commission proposes to call them "members of the Wales Parliament," or WMP, but the MWP version received the public's greatest support.
Of course, the CHA offers alternatives, but an effort to reach agreement can cause problems for Chairman Elin Jones, who is to submit a draft change bill within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the Assembly’s work, including rules for the time being and the structure of the committee system.
THE hour will hold a final vote on its new name when legislation will be discussed.
The Macedonians are going to vote for a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change the country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
Voting was organized to resolve a long - standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that their northern neighbour’s name is a claim to Greece, and it has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, George Ivanov, opposed to holding a referendum to change the name, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent because Harlem's churches are going through difficult times.
"The old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church here before," said Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither."
He believes that the missing bars can be understood as follows:
“People today are socializing differently.
The bars are no longer the kind of local living room they regularly go to."
As for the churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and that “early or later they will end up where they started”.
The churches, he added, could replace houses with condominiums, and there would be people who would not help the nearby shrines.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” Adams explained, “so this will accelerate the day when all these churches close down because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condos will become their followers. ”
Both churches were built by white communities even before Harlem became a black metropolis: The Metropolis Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Maarten was built ten years later.
The native white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
A black community nearby was given the right to own a building.
St. Maarten moved to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main street in Harlem, and these merchants didn't want to hire blacks and raise them in the service.
In 1939 the building was badly damaged by fire, but Father Johnson’s parishioners wanted it restored and installed a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor to Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the carillion "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played carillion in July called it "cultural treasure" and "inreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the world's first carillion to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Linde, who 18 years ago moved to a larger carillion in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merriweser, he was not replaced in St. Maarten.
What's happening in St. Martin over the last few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of which were engaged by church leaders and others by the bishop's diocese.
The Council, a parish governing body made up of the leaders, wrote in July to the diocese, concerned that the diocese would "try to transfer expenses" to the council, but that the council did not participate in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California was injured by the shark.
According to officials, on Saturday the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, and the boy dived for lobsters in California on the day he opened the lobster season.
The attack took place at almost 7: 00 a.m. near Beacon’s beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV canal in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, and he and a group had sailed to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a thrill to hear about the caught lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, “They bit me!
I've been bitten!
As soon as he reached the boy, he found that his cord was completely torn.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, "A shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken to the Child Council Hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
The rescue captain, Larry Giles, told the media that a few weeks ago, there was a shark in the area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the body.
For the purpose of investigation and security, the authorities blocked 48 hours of access to the beach from the Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsury's planning to go to the British market for cosmetics.
Sainsury's going to compete with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams with cosmetics like the ones in the department store.
As we get to the British market for cosmetics at a cost of 2.8 billion pounds (and continues to grow at a time when the sales of clothing and household goods go down) the larger cosmetics islands will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and in the next year, if the idea is successful, the islands will appear in other shops.
The investment in cosmetics is that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the space that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and home goods.
In Sainsury's, they said they'd double the range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space: brand zones will appear, like those in the Boots stores.
The supermarket also updates the Boutique cosmetics: Most of the products presented will now not be tested on animals, which is increasingly required by young buyers.
Also, the retailer of Fragrance Hop's perfumer is protesting his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and buying small amounts of food every day in small shops forces supermarkets to make extra efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coop, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that their stores would become more like supermarkets, because the supermarket network is trying to resist Aldi and Lidl's discotheques with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's opens Argos' offices in hundreds of their stores, and there's also a number of Habitats. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and they say that it increased the sales of food products, and it also made both networks more profitable.
An earlier attempt at the supermarket to upgrade the department of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals failed.
Sainsury's tested collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a debate about how to share the proceeds of pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsury's sold their pharmacie business (281 pharmacies) Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for £125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an expanded body of luxuries for skin care, including La Roche-Pasey and Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a commercial director of Sainsbury, said, "We've changed the appearance of our cosmetic islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for customers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who would be able to give advice.
The brands we have presented are designed to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "bittered" because Holly Willoughby is out of the deal worth 11 million pounds.
The dragon's leg star, Peter Jones, is "frozen" because the TV teller Holly Willoughby has made a deal with his brand of goods for life (the value of the deal is £11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spence and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for a brand of household clothes and Truly accessors.
The couple's business was related to the Goop Gwyneth Peltrow brand.
A 37-year-old program manager, This Morning, announced her entrance to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby took Peter Jones' dragon's "Lay" star to rabies when he came out of their lucrative business of goods for life at the last moment to focus on the new convenient contracts with Marks & Spence and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is "frozen" when a gold girl on TV confessed during a busy meeting on Tuesday at Jones's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements worth 1.5 million pounds mean she no longer has enough time to give them a combined brand of household clothes and Truly accessors.
This business was related to the Goop Gwyneth Peltrow brand and was going to double Willoughby's stock, which is valued at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby reported in Instagram coming from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his rest houses.
The source said: “Truly was no doubt Holly’s top priority.
He would be its long - term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to leave the business was shocking to all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday almost before the launch.
At headquarters in Marlowe, there's a full warehouse of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the lead star This Morning, one of Britain's highest-paid stars, could cost the firm millions because of the large investment in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes) and create further delays in launching.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of the three children, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cappe, for ten years.
Willoughby and Cappe created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined him as head of government in March.
The couple held festivals together, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of Baldwin’s television company.
Willoughby will be the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Anthony McCarlyn as the lead I'm A Celebrity with the ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his case."
A violent conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he would get from the news media for a comment that someone would call "non-president," and for a very positive attitude towards North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump make such big concessions? ”
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news director. —
I did not take any action."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have reached a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading North Korean diplomat, Riy Young Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the US response to its first disarmament efforts.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose pressure sanctions.
Tramp was much more optimistic when he gave a talk at his rally.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions would be killed.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American military personnel to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this beat-up stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of those killed
In particular, after the Lomboca earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboka’s population was affected, the national disaster was not declared — a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not seek international assistance, so it is a bit difficult, ” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children gathers a team to travel to Palau, it is not known whether foreign staff will be able to work locally.
Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, stated that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palau to determine whether international organizations could provide assistance.
Considering that earthquakes are constantly taking place in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for nature’s anger.
In the province of Aceh, tsunami shelters are built, but they are not typical of other coasts.
The obvious absence of a siren for a tsunami warning in Palau, although valid, probably contributed to death.
Traveling between countless Indonesian islands is not easy, even in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship in Lombowz for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palau, but it will be able to reach the site of a new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure by laying the foundations of his election campaign and increasing the cost of roads and railways.
But funding deficits have created problems for Mr. Joco's administration, which is planning to move back next year.
Mr. Joko is also hindered by the prolonged interfaith enmity in parts of Indonesia, where the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands evicted from their homes as a result of opposition from Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes a new monument that will suffer from “rewriting history”
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved payment for the destruction in Taliban style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his diamond followers.
But Cromwell's community called Mr. Creek's proposal "foolishness" and "a attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmit, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said, "In view of the current debate about the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell would become a target at Westminster's Palace."
Iconoclasty during the English civil wars was neither carried out by Cromwell himself nor at his command.
Cromwell is likely to be undeservedly sacrificed because of the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell, sculptor William Hamo Thornecroft, is a testimony to the mood of the 19th century and part of the history of the figure that many people think is still worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmit said to the Sunday Telegraph, "Many probably more at the end of the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchys.
Whether such an idea is accurate is an object of historical debate that endures.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures representing one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and honoring."
A killing pig destroyed a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the name of Yuan was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a leadman in the market in Livepangshui, Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Blue, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005, pigs are going to be vaccinated into pigs in pigs.
It is reported that on Wednesday he left with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and found the lead’s door open.
The brother pointed out that the piggy had a big boar with blood on its mouth.
A forensic expert confirmed that 249 kilograms of boar destroyed the farmer to death.
"My cousin's feet were bloodthirsty and distorted," said the cousin of the victim named Wu, who was quoted by the Guyang Evening News.
The security camera showed that Yuan had entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police collected evidence on the scene, the pig was locked to prevent its attack on people.
It is reported that seven of me are Yuan and the market administration discussing compensation for his death.
Rarely, however, cases of pigs attack have been recorded before.
In 2016 the pig attacked the woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm and injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a seven - pound [295 kg] pig had held a Welsh farmer tightly to the tractor until the farmer’s wife scared the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer stated to CCC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but blood can become a trigger.
"They're just playful.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to treat them with due respect, ” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
It was predicted that Hurricane Rosa would be weakened by moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the days to come, Rose will bring rains with floods to the north of Mexico and to the south-west of the United States.
Rose had winds of 137 km per hour (this is a category 1 hurricane) on Sunday, 5 o'clock in the east, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It's expected that on Sunday, Rose will be heading north.
In the meantime, the Pacific Ocean is starting to form a wetland that moves east toward the western coast of the United States, and as it approaches the Baja Peninsula in the form of tropical storms on Monday, it will begin to push the strong tropical moisture northward to the southwest United States.
On Monday, Rosa will be raining up to eight feet [25.4 cm] in some parts of Mexico.
Next, in the coming days, tropical moisture, which interacts with the approaching valley, will cause heavy rains in the southwest.
In this area between two and a half inches [2,54 and 10.2 cm] of rain will cause dangerous torrents of rain, garbage, and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical moisture will cause rainfall to increase to between 5 and 7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
The rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in large areas of Arizona.
Rainwater floods are possible when conditions deteriorate dramatically because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We urge you not to walk to the desert because tropical rains are possible.
The heavy rain can make the canyons stormy, and the storms will bring in violent winds and dust storms.
Nearning the wetland will cause heavy rains in some parts of California’s northern coast.
Precipitous rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause heavy streams of garbage and slippery roads.
This will be the first downpour in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and morning on Monday, and on Monday evening and Tuesday, the rain will become more extensive.
The heavy rain will flow over Fore-Corners from Tuesday through Wednesday.
In October, intense temperatures can be observed throughout the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics remain warm.
At times, this results in extreme temperature swings at short distances.
A fine example of extreme temperatures in the central part of the United States will be seen on Sunday.
It's almost a 7 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaja, Nebraska State, and St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, summer heat will try again and spread.
It is expected that in the vast central and eastern United States, the temperature will be warm until October, and that from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast, the temperature will be 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C.].
The temperature in New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long-term forecast of weather, there is a high probability that average temperatures will exceed in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched the Brett Cavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, over 20 million people on six television networks watched exciting testimony from a candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice, Bretta Cavanano and Christine Blaze Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s.
The political opposition continued, the channels interrupted planned programs to report the latest news on Friday: the agreement prepared by Senator Arisoni Jeff Flake about the FBI conducting a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavanano was drinking her and that he was trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Cavanaugh said that he was 100 percent sure that this was not the case.
It's very likely that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people were watching it, as Nielsen, a research company, had reported.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
It was not possible to immediately obtain numbers on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching television in offices.
By comparison, such an audience is about the size of an audience that is watching the playoff series or the Oscar Award.
Fox News Channel, whose thinkers strongly supported Cavanaugh's assignment, was the leader among all the channels at the hearing that lasted all day, with an average audience of 5.69 million, reported in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, there were 3.1 million spectators in CBS, 2.94 million in NBC, 2.89 million in MSNC, and 2.52 million in CNN.
Interest remained high after listening.
Flake became the central figure of the Friday drama.
This moderate Republican's office published a statement that he would vote for Cavanaugh, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS were recorded as protestors were shouting at Flake as he was trying to go on the elevator to hear the Judicial Committee.
He was standing with his eyes down for a few minutes during which he was vilified, broadcast live on CNN.
“ I’m standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have power, and a multitude of women are powerless."
Flake reported that his office had issued a statement and that before the elevator was closed, he had added that he would speak more at the committee’s hearing.
All cables and broad channels broadcast live hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote on the promotion of Kavano’s candidate to the Senate in full composition.
Flake said he'd only do that if he knew the FBI would consider the charge against the candidate next week, which was a democratic minority.
Flake partially convinced the discussions with his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns and then to several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had a bearing, because it was obvious that the Republicans would have no votes to nominate Cavanaugh without investigating.
President Trump initiated the FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “political games” around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her critics of leaving the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview near Theresa on the front page of the paper, the former Foreign Minister of her government, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called "Checkers' Plan for Brexite", stating that it was completely absurd to propose to Britain and the EU to bring together each other's customs.

"That's what's bothering you all the time," said Wade.
The volcano throws ashes out into Mexico City
The ashes, which is pumped out of Popocatepetl, reach southern parts of Mexico’s capital city.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday, since the crater had begun to operate and 183 gas and ash had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center tracked numerous noises and impulses.
The picture on social networks shows the thin layers of ash on the front glass of cars in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Chymilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in the activity of a volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, following an earthquake of 7.1 points in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as the Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police faced Catalan separatists on the eve of the independence ballot anniversary
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protestors for independence faced a special police unit, thousands of people joined protest demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the Catalan vote on separation.
The masked proseparatist group, which was controlled by the specialty, threw eggs and powdery paint into them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which were usually full of tourists.
The clashes took place and later that day, the police used sticks to hold back aggression.
A few hours later, groups of independenceists who were scandaling, "We won't forget, we won't forgive", faced the conservationists who shouted, "Let Spain live! "
According to a local press report, 14 people were helped to cope with minor injuries caused by protests.
A year after the referendum of October 1, which was declared illegal by Madrid but marked by the Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in an independent region.
Voters generally voted for independence, but the turnout was low, since most who opposed the separation boycott the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police attempts to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region.
The independence groups spent the night in tents on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it had to follow another route.
Sixty-eight-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had the hope of getting independence.
"We went through one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry for joy in voting, but now we are at a dead end, ” he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory of last December's regional elections, the Catalan parties for independence were unable to sustain this year's momentum, because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisonment for their participation in the referendum and for their further declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old engineer who filmed police support on the phone, said that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oril Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the insulator since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament next year.
“The status of a candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression that we observe from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonerry: Men arrested after the car drove into the house
Three men, at the age of 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after driving a car several times into a building in Londonderri.
The incident was on Ballinard Crecent Thursday at 7:30 a.m. in British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blummings noticed that the gate and the house had been damaged.
It is quite possible that at some point a car was shot at from an arboretum.
The Mengi strike provided the Livingstone victory over the Rangers with account 1-0
The first goal of Dolly Menga in the world was "Livingston", which became the winner.
"Leatingston High" shocked the Rangers and brought Stephen Gerrard a second defeat from 18 games in his capacity as the "Ibrokes" club manager.
Dolly Mengi's impact proved to be decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to one level in a second from Gibernian.
Gerhard's team won no victory at the premiership of this season, and next Sunday they're playing with the Harts leaders, who are missing by eight points.
Prior to that, on Thursday, the Rangers will be hosted by the Rapid Vienna within the framework of the League of Europe.
In the meantime, Livingston continues its unconquerable march to six games in the division, and coach Holt, chief coach, has not yet been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the chances of insanity.
Holt's team had to be in front of them long before they killed them, because their directness creates the Rangers of all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but made a kick along the gate; then Alan Letgo broke through the gate after he had rebelled and taken the kick Craig Hulkett along the gate that made his head.
The owners were satisfied that they allowed Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew that they could cause problems for standard guests.
So a decisive goal was killed.
The Rangers missed their free kick, and the Livingston opened up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson activated Mengu, who took the ball and killed him from the center of the jail.
Up until this stage, Rangers were dominated by the ball, but the protection of the owners of the fields turned out to be unproved and Liam Kelly's gate was largely unsettling.
This trend continued in the second half of the time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike Kelly.
Scott Pittman was kicked by a needleper called the Rangers, Allan McGreager, and letgoo hit the gate in another standard Lewingston combination.
The Nassels were constantly arriving at the Likingston Fine and constantly neutralized, and two applications on the Toolbar were rejected after the Hulkett attack on Glenn Middleton, who had been replaced, and the play with their hands.
Livingston Phenomenon: Analysis
Aladair Lamont of "BBC Scotland" at Tony Macharoni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal game and the result of "Livingston".
They were all playing great games, and they continued to outstrip expectations on this up-and-down path.
Their style of play and warehouse remained virtually unchanged after returning to the highest level, but Holt should be given credit for the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hallett played huge, well organized defenses, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Warral keep on the watch.
Rangers, however, were not inspired.
Previously, they had played very well under the leadership of Gerard, but they are now far from reaching those standards.
They didn't have enough of the last ball -- only once they broke the defenses of the owners of the fields -- and it was kind of like waking up for the Rangers that ended up in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was widely accepted in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29,), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there were smiles and blue skys.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's conflicting visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
There have been some controversy over such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Keln to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 people from gathering before the mosque, but many of the president's supporters did appear nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — have also forced themselves to hear, condemning Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The two - way protests reveal the ambiguities of the guest, whom some German Turks called the hero and others the dictator.
Depford Road Accident — A Cyclist Killed in collision with a car
A bicycleman was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the Beswood Street and Evelyn Street intersection on a busy road in the Despford area in the southeastern part of town at about 10:15 a.m. British standard time.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man was killed.
This accident took place a few months after another cyclist died after the driver escaped from an accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from a Saturday accident.
The London police said that they were working to establish a man’s identity to inform his immediate family.
Travel is forbidden and bus routes changed, and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Laarten Prison: Six prison inmates injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured by a riot in a man's high-security prison, the prison administration reported.
The disturbances in Her Majesty Long Lantin's prison in Woostershire began at about 09:30 British standard time on Sunday, and they're still going on.
To stop the disturbance, eight prisoners initiated and localized in one wing, a special unit called Tornado was called up.
The officers were provided with medical care in connection with the slight injuries to the face on the scene.
The prison officer commented: “In order to resolve the incident in Her Majesty Long-Larten prison, specially trained prison staff were involved.
Six employees received medical treatment for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and their prison sentences may be extended."
In Her Majesty Long Lantin prison, there are more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief had been sent to hospital after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, a special police unit was called into prison to stop serious disturbances in which prisoners were attacked with billiards
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with torrential floods (dry areas can benefit)
Tropical depression rarely hit Arizona, but this can happen at the beginning of the following week, since the remains of Hurricane Rose are heading through the southwest of the desert, risking flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of torrential flooding on Mondays and Tuesdays from western Arizona to south-east Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's expected that Rosa will go straight across Phoenix on Tuesday, and it's expected to rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
a Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to recent forecasts by the National Hurricane Center, in the Mogollon Rom region of Arizona, between 5.08 and 10.16 cm and places up to 15.24 cm of rain.
Other regions of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.54 and 5.08 cm of rainfall, places maybe up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of floodwaters, Rose’s rainfall can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rains are likely to be useful because the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Center for Drought Monitoring, a little over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category of drought, reportsweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rose's path leads to a shift on the Mexican peninsula in Baja California.
Rose, on Sunday morning, in the force of a storm at a maximum speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm meets with more cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and thus weakens.
Thus, it is expected that by means of a tropical storm day or evening, a hurricane will cause a landslide in Mexico.
The rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a significant risk of flooding.
“The total rainfall from Lower California to northwest Sonora is expected to be between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, possibly 25.4 cm,” reportsweather.com.
Then Rose will go north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue through Arizona and later Tuesday evening she will reach southern Utah.
“The main danger expected of Rose or her remains is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonori and the southwest American desert, ” reports the National Hurricane Centre.
These rains are expected to lead to life - threatening floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as to landslides in the mountainous region.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terras area at Midsomer Norton about 4:00 a.m. on the British standard Saturday time.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man arrested at night in the Radstock district, reported to Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asked to respond to anyone who can have any video recording of these events on the phone.
Trump says that Cavanaugh “suffered the meanness and anger ” of the Democratic Party
“The voice for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” declared Trump at a rally in Wilinga, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh had been “suffered by the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the entire process of hanging.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, furiously and emotionally denying the charge that Christine Blazee Ford had committed sexual violence against her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing of the charges against her.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "the American people saw the brightness, character and courage" of Cavanaugh.
"The voice for Judge Cavanaugh is the voice for one of the most advanced lawyers of our time, a lawyer with the perfect experience of public service," he said to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president was quick to mention Cavanaugh’s promotion when he spoke of the importance of Republicans’ appearance in the medium term.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I’m not running, but I’m really running, ” he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the mission of democracies is to “oppose and hinder”.
It's expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate for Cavanaugh's candidature will take place not later than Friday, and CNN was informed by an assistant to one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds of people died from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of casualties is increasing
At least 384 people died, many washed away in the ocean when huge waves struck the beach as a result of the intense earthquake and tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, claiming the country’s authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) in the dusk crashed on the shore, beating many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 points.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and didn't start running immediately, and they were victims," stated Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) in Jakarta.
"It wasn't just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on land," said Nugroho, adding that before hitting the coast, the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/year).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed the trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
Aeronautics published by the Disaster Management Agency reveal that many buildings and stores have been destroyed, bridges have been turned and destroyed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Tensions in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Applications Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the severe earthquake on Friday was 200 times more than the energy of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could contribute to the tsunami’s strength, declared the agency.
Nugroho called the damage “wide-scale” and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the debris of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that victims and injuries could be more than 300 km (190 miles) along the coast line north of Palau in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn't get any information" from Donggal, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, says the Red Cross statement, and it adds that its staff and volunteers have gone to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much bigger," says the report.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Pale, although officials said that the waves had arrived at a time of warning.
The amateur images shared by people on social networks reveal how a man on the top floor of a building sounds a fierce warning that tsunamis are approaching people on the street under the building.
After a few minutes, the wall of the water crashed into the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the reality of the frames immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power cut that cut off connection around Pale, making it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
Military officials began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, reporting to the authorities, but evacuees still desperately needed food and other basic necessities.
The airport was opened for relief, and it would be closed by October.
President Joko Vidodo was to visit evacuation centers in Palau on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggal made their way safely to the city of Palu, where they hide in tarpaulin casts installed in their office yard, but on the way they saw scenes of desolation, Mr. Doseb said.
"They told me they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams began to take decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with great experience were not allowed to travel to Palau.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level, ” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted."
By the second night, she had been down on Pala after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, and friends and families of those who had not yet been found were still hoping that the arrival of their loved ones would be a miracle that would decorate these grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken from the sewers.
On Sunday the rescuers received a woman who had been lying under the rock for two days with her mother’s body nearby.
Hendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian National Team for Paraplanerism, trained two missing paraplaners to participate in the Asian Games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplaners who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandag, were his disciples.
“ As a senior paraplaner, I have my emotional burden, ” he said.
Hendon relates how a few hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to the community of paraplaners, he desperately sent messages to the rivals of Pal who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray tick, not with double blue ticks.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26 750 to fill the ATM in Newport on the Level
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26 750 from a Brink worker who was running an ATM at Newport on the Level, reporting to the Newport Police Department.
The car driver empty an ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man "snuck in the back of a colleague Brink" and stole a bag of money intended to fill it up.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects fleeing the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of participants.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanja West: The raper changes his name to E.
Reper Canier West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, when he announced a change in Twitter, he wrote, "Early officially known as Kanier West."
The 41-year-old West was called Y, and he used it as a name for his album released in June.
The change took place just before he appeared on the Sunday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaces a singer named Ariano Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons," the author of the show said.
This is not just a contraction of the professional name, but West used to say that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe "e" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with the radio show Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanier, which means "one," was shortened to just Y -- it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanyer is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combbs, formerly known as Puff Deaddy, P. Diddy and Grandfather, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brothers Lav.
A former colleague of Westa, JA-Zi, also experimented with dashes and big letters.
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico promises not to use an army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use an army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the massacre of students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, López Obrador promised “never to use an army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, the military fired a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people, while left - wing student movements were beginning to take place throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities have led young people into criminal gangs.
US$ needs to double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
Because China's increasing activity in artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount it spends on research in this field, and it views as an investor and practicer in the Shi Kai-Foo Lee field who worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the U.S. does not have a formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it wants to become #1 for innovation in AI by 2030.
"The double budget for AI would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we are preparing for the next AI breakthrough," said Lee.
The doubling of funding can double the probability that the next great achievement in AI will be made in the U.S., said Lee in CCB this week's interview.
Lee, whose book "Nazi's Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houchton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of the Sinovation Ventures Foundation, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Mello, he was working on a AI system that played the best American player in Otello and later was Executive Director Microsoft Research and president of the Google China branch.
Lee highlighted the previous technology competitions of the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects (DAARPA), and asked when there would be next to help identify the next prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring luminaries from universities in recent years to work on AI.
According to Lee, immigration policy changes can also help the U.S. to increase its efforts in AI.
“I believe Green Card should be automatically offered to PhD candidates,” he said.
The Chinese Council of State published its Plan for the Development of the New Generation’s Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to academic workers, just as the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, and the quality of academic work in China is below, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Advanced Intelligence to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee for the Advanced Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the next initiative.
With regard to the National Science Foundation, it is now investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to set up the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, took no steps for months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change the country's name to “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would resolve a multi-year dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia's possibility of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments entered into a treaty on the basis of the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents of the agreement argue that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he wouldn't vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the turnout of the minimum 50% voters would allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The questions in the referendum bulletin are, "Do you support NATO and EU membership under the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that formed after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, should pay for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the influence of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Oliver Georgievsky in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legal, enough members of Parliament said they would support it to make it decisive.
It's going to take two-thirds of the vote in Parliament to change the name.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported before 1:00 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters threw their ballot papers into the urns.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," stated 62-year-old vote in the capital, Skopje.
On September 30th, 2018, in Stramica, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorika, and his son, Dosko, gave their vote in a referendum to change the name of the country, which will open the way for entry into NATO and the European Union.
Before the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardak was preparing a small scene and putting chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We're behind NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the service door,” said Quardarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will vote in favour, since over 80% of our citizens speak for the EU and NATO,” said Zaire after voting.
He said that the result, yes, would confirm their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia, 30 to 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telema, 57 percent of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the policy of the Western government since its beginning last May.
See, Sergio Aguero from Manchester City goes all the way to Briton's defense and hits the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Störling passed the Brighton defense and brought the Manchester City victory with the account 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal for the 65-minute match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker got a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Briton supporters and found himself in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went around one defender, then he went around a few more on the edge of the Brighton fine.
Then he made his pasta to the left when he saw Sterling.
The English Forard made the first touch of a fine to give Aguero's ball, which, with its right bouts, launched it into the right-hand side of the gate, defeating Matthew Ryan's Brighton needleman.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” said the Citi Manager, Pep Guardioll, to journalists.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he hit a target at this moment."
But the initial advantage of the sky blue in this game of the Prime League was provided by Sterling.
That goal took place at 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep inside Briton.
He sent a beautiful crossing pass along the left flank of Leroy Sanet.
Leroy made several touches, and then he made a Sterling pass in the direction of the far - off trouser.
The sky-colored Forward threw the ball at the gate just before he slipped off the border.
The City will meet with Hoffenheim at the team stage of the League of Champions at 12:55 Tuesday at the Rhine-Nekkar-Arena Stadium in Zensheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take points at Roquis.
Because Washington Nasnoals left the playoff team, there was no good reason to wait for another start.
But Sherzer's competitive expectation is to go out on a Pitcher Auguste on Sunday in a match against Colorado Roquis, provided Roquis still has difficulty getting out of playoff, and now Roquis is playing one game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
The Roquis has at least a World Card for winning the 5-2 bill over the Nachionales on Friday night, but still wants to secure the title of the first Division.
"Despite the fact that we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to leave the ball, knowing how the audience is doing here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing the highest level I've seen this year.
Why don't I want to take part in this competition?
Nachionales will yet declare who's going to be a starter on Sunday, but they're told that they're going to be a Sherzer.
Sherzer, who's going to be the 34th start, on Thursday, he's had a pincing session and he can play Sunday, his usual day off.
The Washington's right-wing result is 18-7 out of 2,533 ERA and 300 strikes at 220,2/3 inning in this season.
Tramp Festivals in West Virginia
The president made a quick reference to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the appearance of Republicans in the medium - term elections.
“All that we have done will be at stake in November.
In five weeks, there will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I don't run, but I'm really running, so I'm fighting everywhere I can for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see it's happening right now.
And they're committed to getting power back, using whatever means, you see meanness, shitty.
They don't care who's suffering from them, who needs to step over to get power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them."
The democracy mission, he said, was to “oppose and hinder”.
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "wicked and mean, disgusting and lying."
He mentioned the Senate's Judicial Committee, naming Democratic Senator Dian Feinsstein by name, which provoked the audience to a loud cry of discontent.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was really the bad language of the bodies -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to sue me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last of those parliamentarians in Parliament to be told that they're not happy, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated almost the same way because she was determined against anti-Semitism.
I was convicted because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbin.
As to the importance of responsible economic policy in terms of national security in Europe, these questions are ironically similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the meeting of the Labourists on Friday says, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the evening Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labourists were just like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of a "more kind, more soft" policy has long been forgotten if it's ever been implemented.
It's becoming increasingly evident that there are no different views in the Labour Party and that every thought is evaluated from the point of view of whether it's acceptable for the leadership of the Party.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues I thought I had this kind of political opinion began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept positions that I would never agree with, whether it be national security or the only market in the EU.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn't matter what I say — there's a barrage of social media attacks calling back, condemning the politics of the center, I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I receive are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who daily face the flow of sexist or racist attacks but who never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so large a church, and with every movement of mistrust or change in the rules for selecting a party, the party is narrowed down.
During the last two years, I have received a lot of advice, and I have been told not to hang out, not to speak loud enough to be “all right with me. ”
But that's not why I came to politics.
I joined the labists 32 years ago as a high school student, because because of the lack of attention on the part of the Tetcher government, my high school class was literally falling apart, since then, I've been trying to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether they're a local adviser or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East was confused by my political views and differences with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to the Friday events, I just want to say one thing: when the country goes to Brexite, which will harm households, businesses and government services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, both members of the Labour Party and not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to call me back and no political gain will prevent me from acting according to what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament from Nottingham East.
Air 38 - 17 Melrows: Unconquered Air climbs up
The last two attempts may have distorted the end result, but no doubt Eir deserved a triumph in today's great entertainment match of the Premiership of Scotland.
Now they lead the table, this is the only unconquerable team of ten.
After all, the excellent defense and the improved ability to take advantage of opportunities gives the owners and coach Peter Merchi the right to be content.
“So far we have been tested in our games, and we are still unconquerable, so I must be content,” he said.
Robin Christy of Melrows commented, "I give Eir credit," they used better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, implemented by Fracier Climeau, led Air, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, released by Verris, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baghot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo strengthened Air's leadership by means of a toolbar and immediately before the break made and implemented a solo trial that gave account 17-5 for Air's benefit.
But Melrough did well on the second time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, who was taken out of the field on his noses, and from the Air restaurant, he came forward with Stafford McDowell's attempt, which was implemented by Climo.
Captain Air Blair McFurson had a yellow card at the time, and once again Melrough forced another player to pay the unrealized attempt of Bruce Colvin under intense pressure.
The gentlemen came back, but when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for interception of Climo without a ball from the line of the jail, McFurson made a touchdown behind Air mole.
Climo realized the attempt he was making almost every time after the restaurant, and then Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's hit in the box and sent a flanger, Gregor Henry, to the fifth attempt by the host team.
It looks like the "All Still Game" star is set up for a new career in the restaurant sphere.
It seems like Ford Kiran's "All Still Game" star is set for a new career in the area of hospitality, and this can be concluded after it's become known that he's the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC TV series, a script he writes and films with Greg Hamfield's old comedy partner.
Duet announced that the next 9th series would be the last in the show, and Kirnan seems to be planning his life after Craigling.
According to the official record, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, even though the source of the Scottish Sun implied that Kyrenan wanted to enter Glasgow's "blossom restaurant business."
May ours: Bolivia's interior hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the equipped fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang the ocean blue flag.
The bases of the sea from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with a slogan, "Maritime is right.
We must bring him back."
In Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, there is still a memory of the loss of a coastal line that has gone into 19th century bloody conflict over natural resources, and there is a desire to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision on October 1 after five years of trial.
“In Bolivia there is a impulse, a spirit of unity and tranquillity, and of course it looks forward to a positive outcome,” commented Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia on large screens throughout the country, and they hope that the courts in the Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, that after decades of partial conversation Chile will be forced to negotiate Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his election next year, also looks forward to a decision announced on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in Bolivia’s favor, and if that happens, little will change.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to judge Chilean territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that a decision taken by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia only six months after the final arguments were made indicates that the case was “not complex, ” said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia’s case has not advanced, and for the past four years it has been possible to contribute back.
“The request for access to the sea has been used by today’s Bolivian administration,” said Zarata.
Morales ’ militant rhetoric blew up the remains of Chilean kindness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their dialogue at some point, but it will be very difficult to discuss afterwards.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Weltse, a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, disagreed that the court’s approval was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia would have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of differences with mutual benefit," he said.
Calvin also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — had used the maritime issue as a political sword.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific, ” he added.
This is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't be possible if it can't trust the United States
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Young Ho, says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons before it can trust Washington.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called upon the United States to fulfil the promises made during Singapore's summit by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments appeared when U.S. secretary Mike Pompeo seems at the threshold of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which had reached a dead end more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong In.
Ri says that the belief that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition to the United States of America to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will one day put North Korea on its knees is a "unreal dream."
Washington, D.C., is afraid to adopt a declaration before Pignian takes significant steps in disarmament.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is a widespread skepticism that Pignian takes seriously the renunciation of his arsenal, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pianias the following month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive head coverings that are already heading into the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you've found the right thing to do.
Valentine's and Tom Brown's designers demonstrated a number of excrete-style excreted head coverings from the spring-lito collection of 2019 on the podium of a brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats have filled Instagram this summer, and name designers have already sent their own glamorous creations beyond the podium.
Valentineo stood out with an exponential beige hat with broad-shaped field feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Among other things, the supercesses are decorated with precious stones of watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple's hat, but they are not meant to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated a number of original masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many of these multicolored masks had stitched lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creature resembled underwater swimming equipment with tubes and glasses, and another looked like an ice cream rod that had melted away.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Styleists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
The 3Ds got into fashion thanks to La Bombi, a straw hat with a width of 60 centimeters, which you saw in everyone from Ryan to Emily Ratagski.
The cultural brand behind a very impractical hat, which you could see everywhere on social networks, gave the world another creation: a straw beach bag the size of almost like a model in a bathtub carrying it.
A bag of yellow-red Rafia with a ruffium and a white leather pen was central to La Riviera's collection of spring-lito 2019 Jacquemus brands in Paris' fashion week.
"The next summer, I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the influence of designers is so great that it's hard to ignore the demand for super-accelerates."
John Edward: Language skills are compulsory for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain high standards of learning, and in 2018 they again obtained excellent exams, complemented by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, attended by over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SSRS), and seek to provide the best level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for the further and higher education they have chosen for their careers and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, he understands it with his mind.
If you speak to her in her own language, she will take it with her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's exams show that in independent schools, languages lead high-quality subjects.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received higher A.
Data collected in 74 SRTS schools showed that 72 percent of students received higher A in Chinese, and 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also received A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now languages are taught as subjects for choice, just like Ntim (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), in independent school programs and in other institutions.
A 2014 survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission showed that 17 percent of the reasons why employers cannot close vacancies related to language skills are insufficient.
So language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for a future career.
As language skills are increasingly needed, they are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you've chosen, if you've learned a second language, you're going to have a real advantage in the future because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives the multiple - language user the advantage over competitors.
According to a 2013 survey of more than 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two - percent (15 percent).
That's why investments in language education are now important for today's children.
Learning a number of languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a full - time job.
In Scotland, each school will teach its own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are most important to Britain in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, several languages can always be chosen to study them with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools try to create a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed regardless of what the future holds for them.
Now you can't deny that in the international business environment, language continues to be vital to the future country, so it has to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as “skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and perfection to Scottish youths.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron debuts with Lakes in San Diego.
The fans who want to see LeBron James's first launch for Los Angeles Lakes almost waited.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday at the first pre-zone match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll play, it's not settled yet.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakeers reporter Mike Trudll reported that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After his training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lekers games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-zone games," he said.
Trump Metches in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of pre-election meetings today from the city of Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Tramp meetings scheduled for next week, including the friendly state meetings, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final election to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump seeks support for future mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after voting in November.
At what time will this evening’s Trump rally be held in West Virginia, and how can you look on the Internet?
A rally of Trump in the city of Willing in West Virginia scheduled for 19 hours Eastern today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online down online on YouTube.
Trump will probably mention this week's tense hearings about a candidate to the Bretta Cavanaugh Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment, and about the Senate's postponement of the vote for a week while the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November election.
President Trump's representatives said that these five rallys next week were aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters, because the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand most of what they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," reports Reuters.
“The Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the tense season of the pre-election campaign is approaching,” said Reuters by a representative of the Trump campaign who refused to call his name.
A meeting scheduled for Wesbanko Arena in Willing can be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as by media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be the second in the last month of Trump's visit to West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of his vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate to the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morris, whose rating is behind the polls.
“ It’s not good for Morris that the president comes to raise his rating in the polls, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder 2018 Cup: U.S. team set up to fight and hope before Sunday singles
After three sessions that ended in a unilateral victory, the afternoon Saturday force could be exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
The shaky pendulum of the pulse is a fully invented sports concept that is truly believed by players, especially in similar competitions.
So when do they say the pulse is active?
"They were six points ahead, and now four points ahead, so I think we take it a little bit as a impulse," said Jordan Spit when he came in.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead and another twelve points in the game.
Americans, as Speth says, feel a little bit of wind in their sails, and they're encouraged by a lot, not least by the shape of Speed and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three points out of four.
Sleeping with his killer blows from the hand-to-hand to the grave illustrates an example.
These guttural cries of celebration became louder when, in the continuation of his round, he made a decisive snare and compared the score at the fourth match after he and Thomas had lagged behind by two points.
His sweat, which allowed them to win a 15 - hole match, met with a similar cry, one that tells you that the American team doesn't give up.
"You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match," said Speth.
That's all that each of these players has left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas have been in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood — the incontrovertible story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe have four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
Molwood was the only couple who didn't do the gods on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to avoid the god on Saturday morning and after Friday afternoon and on the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This run and how their energy seems to flow back and forth to this tumultuous crowd, makes them believe that they'll win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players other than Fleetwood or Molinari to secure the potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Both are welcome on different holes at the same time.
However, it is early to talk about European triumph.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went after Sergio Garcia, the hero of morning forbola while he was with Alex Noren.
One god and two dabs in the first nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of your hole.
It's very interesting to see forbosses and forsoms close up through interaction between couples, through the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and it's interesting to see how strategy can change in a single moment.
Europe is still playing better as a team and has a big advantage on the last day, but this force session has also shown that the U.S. team is going to fight for what some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with account 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a strong advantage, because after Saturday forks and forss, it's ahead of the United States with 10-6.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari won two wins over the falling Tiger Woods, and now they have four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which is trying to recover the trophie that they lost on Hazelstein two years ago, dominated the American team in morning forbola with the account 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in force and won two games, but it was unable to narrow the gap.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophies.
Flitwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, but he and Molinari (including Mollywood) after the sensational weekend are only the second couple to get four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
By destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the forballs, they joined together to defeat the lost Woods and the American newcomer, Bryson Deschambo, with an even more powerful 5th-4.
Woods, who pulled out two games on Saturday, demonstrated a random flash of genius, but he was currently losing 19 of his 29 games in forbolas and forsms and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who didn't take part in morning bobs, went back to Henry Stanson's partner in forsses to get a loss of 2t1 from Dastin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, which is the first and third in the world rating.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its own way in this pleasant, fresh day, southwest of Paris.
Three times, the leading winner, Jordan Spit, and Justin Thomas, set the American standard with their two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory of 2to 1 over the Spaniards John Ram and John Paulter in the forbola and later won the first two holes of Paul and Rory McLroy.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has returned with a four-point deficit in singles, although the Furika team needs nothing to save the trophy.
However, after a second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it could not be done.
North Korea says that "no way" will be disarmed in a unilateral order without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea announced to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was deepening mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would in no way be able to renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that last year North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill”, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of the nuclear testing site and the commitment not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see a response from the United States," he said.
“There will be no confidence in the US for our national security, and under no circumstances will we be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
And while Ree repeated familiar North Korea's complaints about Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, his statement was important because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, which Pignian had done in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong In and Donald Trump's joint statement at the first ever summit between the real president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised North Korean security assurances.
North Korea is looking forward to the formal end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has stated that P’yenne must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to the calls to weaken strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on `denuclearization first' and raises pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes `announcing the end of war',” said Ree.
“To believe that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri didn't mention the plan of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader emphasized at the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Mun Jae Yin, over the past five months, and added, "If South Korea, not the United States, were the party to the issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Despite this, Ree's tone was very different from last year's when he told the General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "human missile man" who wants to commit suicide.
This year at the UN Trump, which last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, commended Kim for his courage in implementing disarmament measures, but said that much more needs to be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday Trump noted that he doesn't set a time limit for this: "It's going to take two years, three years, or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pigniane for the steps he has taken.
However, U.S. secretary-general Mike Pompeo stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and steadily until we see complete, final, confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block the financing of Pianese nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ree in the United Nations General Assembly, and then he said that he would return the following month to visit Pignjan to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has failed.
He left Pian in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for “gangster demands”.
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to clear the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States took “opportunity”.
He said that Kim said that he needed “appropriate measures” as security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are in the course on how to get enough rest.
The new course at Harvard University this year provided all his students with more sleep, and it's an attempt to combat the growing culture of high school all night after caffeine.
The teacher found that students at university number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of caring for themselves.
Charles Chasler, a sleep professor at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Briham Women’s Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the effect of sleep deprivation on education.
At the end of the day, a girl came up to him and said, "Why am I being told this in the final year?"
"She told me that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," said the teacher from The Telegraph.
The course that was first introduced this year explains how good sleep habits help students to achieve academic and sporting results as well as to improve their overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s medical services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was discovered that students were seriously deprived of sleep within a week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one chapter, there's pictures of a room in a dorm where students click cups of coffee, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deficits on sports indicators, and the importance of sleep-related rudders.
In another chapter, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change students' behavior instantly.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health consequences of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Chasler.
The culture of pride for sleep all night still exists, he added, and he also noted that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is increasing.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be a student's secret weapon to deal with stress, burnout and anxiety, even with weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of hunger that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian, who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler develop a course after enrolled in one of his other courses last year at Harvard's first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all students to undergo a similar training program before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chassler recommends that students remind themselves of the need to go to bed, and that they be alert to the harmful effects of blue light, which are emitted by electronic screens and LEDs and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, causing sleep problems.
"Leatingston" 1 - 0 "Raingers": Menga's goal has upset Gerard's boys.
Rangers survived another invasion of exit sadness: Dolly Menga's blow brought a distinguished team, Stephen Gerard, defeating account 1-0 from the "Livingston" account.
The Aybrox team wanted to win its first victory at the 18-game exit match after the February triumph over St. Johnston account 4-1, but Gary Holt's team defeated Jerry second as a manager of 18 games, while Gerard's team remained eight points behind the Scottish Prime Minister Harts.
Menga was killed seven minutes before the break, and Rangers, which lacked inspiration, didn't look like it could equalize the score.
Now Rangers are down in position six, and Livingston is up in position three, and the difference between the balls is greater than the Hibernian.
In addition, Rangers may be faced with another problem, because the lineman Kalum Spence was forced to handle the head wound after being thrown into the guest sector by an object.
Jarard made eight changes to the team that once passed by the Air in the semi-final Scottish League Cup.
And Holt released the same Levi 11 warehouse that took one point at Harts last week, and was thrilled by the way that his forced boys beat up rivals at every turn.
Maybe Rangers were dominated by the ball, but Livingston worked more with the ball.
They were supposed to kill in just two minutes of play, when the first Menga pass into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to strike at Allan McGreath's gate, but the half-defenser wasted this great chance of sending the ball past the gate.
Kegan Jacobs got a deep free kick from Craig Halquett, but his defense partner, Alan Letgow, hit the back of his pants.
Rangers did get control, but the last third had more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos no doubt felt that he should be entitled to a panel on the sign of a quarter of an hour after the impact with Stephen Loulis, but the reporter Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian address.
The Rangers were able to strike only two times at the gate in the first half of the time, but Liam Kelly's ex-Ibrox Gater hit Lassanna Coulibaly's head and Ovier Ejaria's peaceful blow was hardly disturbed.
And while the 34-minute front goal of the Livingstone may have contradicted the game, no one can deny that they only deserve it by their hard work.
The Rangers couldn't do it again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Mengu for a simple ending.
In the intermission, Gerard replaced the Coulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when he broke into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly jumped off his line to block it.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like when Litgou and Halquet are playing one long pasta after another.
Holt's team could've improved in the last stages, but McGreag was very good at resisting Jacobs before he hit Litego out of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, replacement for Rangers, made another late application for a fine when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson took a look again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and time goes by... Germany was born to future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Ghans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Countless Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example, in the 1950 movie Call Coronado with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who are playing into the appearance of the scientific cowboys.
Man: What is it?
Rogers: This is the Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear how the atoms are affected by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Well, it's really breaking now!"
The Guang died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to watch and kill malignant cells
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method involves removing the patient’s immune cells and changing them in the laboratory
And then these cells are able to see proteins that are common to many types of cancers, and then these cells are re-entering the patient.
A test vaccine shows promising results for patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize malignant cells has lost ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab so that these cells can “see” common to many types of protein cancer (HER2) and then re-entering these cells.
Professor Jay Bersofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer of Betesse, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
"HER2" stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and color cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which is to remove immune cells from patients and teach them to target cancer cells, has worked to treat one of the types of leukemia.
After the presentation in the SNL studio at the MAGA baseball station Kanier West came out with a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
What caused the audience’s negative reaction
The audience at the SnL studio was reenacted by Canier after his sad performance, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After a third song, called Ghost Town, in a baseball game called "Let's Get America Back to Its Glory", he exploded in a tyrad that criticized the democracies and reiterated his support for Trump.
And oftentimes, white people ask me, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist."
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I'd be leaving America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show started with Matt Damon's sketch, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Committee in a case involving Christine Blaze Ford about sexual violence.
Although the West's speech was not broadcast live, the video, with its thyradiation, set up Chris Rock's comic book on social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to mock West by placing this post.
Also, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes, he had an unpleasant situation because of the headdress.
As reported in Washington Examer, West stated, "When I was behind the scenes, I was treated rudely.
I was told, "Don't go to the audience in this baseball game."
They were kidding me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
West went on to say, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent, and I'm going to put on my superman's baseball, because that's how nobody can tell me what to do, and you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to Variety weekly, his comments have caused at least twice the negative response of the audience in the hall, and the actors of the SNL show have looked confused, and one of the viewers said, "The studio has a dead silence."
The last - minute Westerner was invited to replace Ariano Grande, whose former boyfriend, rap Mac Miller, died a few days before the air.
The West caused many surprise by performing the I Love it (I love it) song in Perrier's water bottle suit.
West supported the head of TPUSA Candez Turner's conservative organization, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the bravest: thank you for breaking up against NATO."
Instead, Karen Gunther, the head of the talk show, wrote on Twitter that West "is who he is, and that's just wonderful."
"Well, I won't reward anyone (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art) who, I think, professes and throws out an ideology that damages my community.
He's a free man.
So did we," she added.
Before the performance on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: now he's the one who used to be known as Kanier West.
West isn't the first performer to change his name, and he's following the example of Grandfather, also known as Puff Dead, Paffy and Pee Grandfather.
Snoop Dogg's colleague was formerly called Snoop Lyon, and as we know, the musical legend of the last few decades, Prince changed his name into a symbol and then became "Artist, formerly known as Prince."
Accused of attempted murder after a knife attack at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after stabbing another man in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The police reported that the incident occurred at the Belligecamore restaurant.
The accused is expected to stand trial before Belfast's magistrates on Monday.
The prosecutor's office will examine the charge.
The star of the "Grazzle of the Thrones" by Keith Gerington condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Gerington became famous for his role as a soldier with the sword of Jon Snow in the brutal medieval phantesic series "Grae of Thrones" of HBO manufacturing.
But 31-year-old actor, condemning the stereotype of macho hero, claims that because of these heroes on screen, young boys often feel that they have to become cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that he thought "something went wrong" and asked me how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the age of the Hashtag #MeTo, too, #carriage, etc.
Keith, who recently married his Grey of the Thrones, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, said that he was "a pretty determined" to deal with this problem.
"I am now quite determined when we are on a slippery path towards idealizing brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their adulthood because of the problem we see today?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality through images of extremely courageous heroes.
And he said, "What is natural and what is planted?
Why does television and the street teach young boys to feel pressured to be such men?
I think today is a really important question, "How can we change it?"
'Cause it's obvious that the young guys have gone wrong."
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any prequel and sikvels of the "Grey of the Thrones" after the show was completed the following summer, because "he's done with the battles and horses."
From November, Kit will play the play "The True West" by Sam Shephard -- stories about the film producer and his brother-in-law.
As the actor recently confessed, he regards meeting his wife Rose as the best he's got from the "Grand of the Thrones" show.
"In the course of this show, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and defined my future life," said Keith.
In a fantasy show that was awarded the award of Emmy, Rose played Igrett, the love of Herington Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June of 2018, and the ceremony was held on the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a dramatic 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a dramatic 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, indicating a change in past trends.
In some parts of China, HIV has been spread rapidly for a long time through infected blood during transfusions.
However, as officials of the health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission over time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China occurred in 1997, but LGBT is often discriminated against.
According to studies, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men marry women in the future because of the conservative values prevailing in the country.
In most cases, transmission occurs as a result of improper use of protective devices during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free access to HIV drugs, viewing this as part of a solution.
Maxine Watts denies the downfall of the senators' data on her network by her regular employee and exposes the harsh criticism of "dangerous lies" and "conspiratory theories."
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a U.S. House of Representatives, condemned allegations that one of her full-time employees had posted personal data on their Wikipedia pages by three U.S. senators.
A democrat from Los Angeles claims that these statements are spread by political observers and websites.
"A lie, a lie, and then an even more hideous lie," said Waters on Twitter.
According to reports, the published information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Getch of Utah.
The data came online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person from Capitolia during a hearing on charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Cavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court judge.
Data leaked some time after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
The Hill reported that conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState had information that the source's IP addresses were linked to the Waters office and were able to track down the data from her staff member.
"These baseless statements are absolute lies, they're not true," Voters continued.
"The staff member of my office whose personal data and safety are threatened as a result of these fabricated and false statements has nothing to do with the outflow of this information.
These baseless statements are absolute lies, they're not true."
Wetters' application was quickly criticized online, and among other things, former White House Spokesperson Ari Fleicher said.
"This denial is full of anger," wrote Fleicher.
"It suggests that with such a character she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, there is no need to become angry.
The accused should not act presumptuously.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and unaffected."
It seems that Fleicher drew parallels between the response of Waters and the criticism of the democracies at Judge Cavanaugh's address, who was accused of looking too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republican Party, who is running for a place to take Waters for the results of the mid - election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"That's the news, if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had already notified "the responsible state and law and order authorities of these false claims."
"We will do our utmost to find the guilty," she continued, "and they were accountable to the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of the film "Argent Johnny Ingles: A New Mission" - a passing parody for spy fighters with Rowan Atkinson
It's already become a good tradition to look into every new British film of thought by Brexit, and there's a new part of a series of comedy parody to the Johnny Ingles fight, and the first film called Johnny Ingles came out as early as 2003, and later the series was re-established in 2011, taking off Johnny Ingles: Re-run.
Is there going to be a mocking and ironic self-deficit about what we're wrong, the new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny Inglesh, with his moving face and his eyebrows for the second time, was able to get a mess, and his name is more than anything else to suggest that this comic character is made for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As we know, Johnny is a cheerless secret agent who, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, is a little bit from Inspector Cluso, a little from Mr. Bin and a lot of stuff from that guy who played one music note from the film Fire chariots at the 2012 London Olympics ceremony.
The character is also foreshadowed by the traveler and the mystery of the international scale, which has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in the long - forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
In the last movie about Johnny Ingles, there's a couple of great things.
I liked the scene of Johnny Inglesh in the knight’s armor approaching the helicopter, and the blades of the screws were daydreaming about his helmet.
The film is very good with Atkinson's talent to set up a buffonade, but the humor is passing, and in some cases it's too much, especially when you compare it to "serious" movie brands like "Agent 007" and "Mission Not Possible", which are also comedy.
It seems as if the jokes are designed for children rather than adults, and I don't find the ridiculous attacks that happen to Johnny Inglesh as resourceful and as thoughtful as the Atkinson jokes in the silent Bin movies.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
The British supersecret network of spies is entered by a hacker and exposes the names of all field agents, which is a complete surprise to the acting agent (Unfortunately Kevin Eldon played only an incident role in the film).
This turned out to be the last drop for Prime Minister, a haughty person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is in deep depression because of losing popularity. (Emma Thompson tried to best convey the image of Theresa May, but the script did not allow him to be fully exposed.)
Intelligence advisers informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she had to involve someone behind her.
The choice falls on Johnny Inglesch, who now works as a teacher in a super-model institution, and informally teaches children operational work undercover (in this part of the spy’s “year - school” Inglesche was a few successful jokes for teenagers).
Inglech is quickly transported to Whitehol for an emergency briefing, where he meets again with his long - suffering friend, Buff, who is played another time by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of an examed nauseous person does not exactly match the talent of Vicky Pepperdin).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty's is going to be scrutinizing, "Betman and Robin" are back in line and suddenly meet the fatal woman Ofelia Pistoletov, who's played by Olga Kurileenko.
And then the prime minister comes under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his wealth in technology and technology and who claims he can solve the problem with the British network, the evil Jason Volt, who was played by Jake Lacey.
Inglesh and Buff go on their journeys and again resort to their ridiculous feats: dressed waitressed by waiters, they fire in a fancy French restaurant; then they sow chaos by illegally travelling abroad on Volta’s luxurious yacht; Ingles, he is really messed up when he tries to use a helmet of virtual reality to learn about Volt’s design.
All stops lead us to the final episode, but by his kindness and violence, he is like a movie for children.
It's a great movie.
Like I was watching other movies about Johnny Inglesh, I asked myself the same question: Can't the British film industry really offer Rowen Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Leborers deny that the plan is going to be prepared, according to which the British will work four days a week, but they will get paid in five days.
The Leborist Party, Jeremy Corbina, has to discuss a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but they'll get paid in five days.
It's reported that the party wants to oblige company leaders to transfer funds saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence to employees, giving them an extra day off.
So the workers are going to have three days off, and they're going to bring home the same salary.
According to the sources, this idea would correspond to the party's economic program and direct the country's resources to support the labor class.
The transition to the four-day workweek was approved by the British Congress of Trade Unions, and it's seen that this way workers can benefit from a change in the overall economic situation.
A source in the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times, "The review of politics will be announced at the end of the year.
It's not going to change overnight, but the idea of a four-day workweek corresponds to the party's approach to changing the economy's balance of interest to the workers, as well as to the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Leiborists didn't approve of this idea first, because the Green Party promised to set up a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party now approve of this desire.
The Speaker of the Labour Party said, "The political programme of the Party does not provide for a four-day working week, so we are not looking at this idea right now."
"The Shadow" chancellor John MacDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party Pre-election Congress last week.
Mr. MacDonnell said he was willing to take back power from the "no-one directors" of the utilities and the "fixers."
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that shareholders of water companies may not get their whole share of the capital if the Labour government starts "counting" on the basis of perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed the intention of including employees in the company board and creating an inclusive stock fund to transfer 10% of the normal private sector stock to employees waiting for annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell the 60 Minutes show, or they may be able to change their opinion in the case of Cavanaugh, which is led by the FBI
In connection with the prosecution of Judge Bretta Cavanano, who is running the FBI, the final election for his appointment to the Supreme Court is postponed for at least a week, and we ask whether the Republican senators will continue to support Cavanaugh after the results of the Bureau's investigation have been published.
On Sunday's 60-minutes show, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
'Yes, of course,' said Kennedy. –
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you really do that?"
He was firm, firm, un Compromising."
Graham’s point of view seems unchangeable.
"I believe the charges against Cavanaugh are provocation," he said.
"Dr. Forde, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brett firmly denied everything," Graham added, addressing Christine Blaze Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm it by oath.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't know what's going to change."
What is Global Cities Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
On this Saturday, New York will host the Global Civil Festival of Festivals — an annual event in the music world with an amazing number of star performers and an equally dramatic mission — to combat poverty worldwide.
During the seventh Global Civil Festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to the Grand Gallery of the Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to draw attention to the real purpose of the Festival, the organizers seek to overcome extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international community organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors have to do a series of tasks or "works," like taking a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or whatever else to help draw attention to the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So, is there any progress, because there are 12 years left for Global Citeen organizers to achieve their goal?
Is it really the idea of giving a free concert a brilliant way to convince people to take action, or is it just another case of what's called "clicitism" where people feel they're actually changing things by signing an electronic petition or making a Twitter publication?
According to Global Cities, since 2011, they've recorded 19 million "acts" of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have moved world leaders to declare planned financial transfusions and programs worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 will help to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
Early in 2018, the group cited 390 financial obligations and public statements as outcomes, and at least 10 billion had already been collected and spent.
The group estimates that the funds provided have already directly affected the lives of some 649 million people around the world.
Among the major financial commitments are the Power of Nutrition Foundation, which is territorial to Great Britain, and as part of the project, investors and implementrs have committed themselves to helping children grow up and have pledged $35 million to help Rwanda cope with malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Cities.
"With the support of the British government, the MES, other governments and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a small fact of history," said the representative of The Power of Nutration Tracy Ullman, speaking to the public at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "acts" that called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for the "The Power of Switzerland" project to improve nutrition for 5 million mothers and children.
In response to a common question on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?"
Global City wrote, "That's a long and hard way, so sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like members of civil rights movements and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd group, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Gianelle Mona is just part of the star performers who will be performing this year at the New York festival and will be led by Deborah Lee Fernness and Hugh Jackman.
The Minister of Internal Affairs has stated that the US can use naval forces for "blocks" to prevent Russian energy exports
According to the U.S. Minister of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, quoted at Washington Examiner, Washington, "if necessary," can seek assistance from naval forces to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including those in the Middle East.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts on an invitation to a legitimate government, was an excuse to explore new energy sources.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to mediate in the energy trade, as they already do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"Thanks to the U.S. Navy can ensure free passage through the sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that stands for itself as "the voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He then compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy efficiently and replace it with alternative energy," he said, calling Russia "one-sided," because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While these claims were being heard, Trump’s administration’s goal was to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by pushing Russian energy out of the market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To that end, Trump officials and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the under-purpose project to build the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Flow of 2 gas, which is worth $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gasgon to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin is convinced that Washington is very much against the project for economic reasons alone, which is an example of dishonest competition.
"In my view, we share the view that energy can't be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak after meeting with the U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization of the German Federal Union (BDI) called on the U.S. not to interfere in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, President of the Federal United of the German Industry, after the last meeting of German chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator, Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, "reservedly think" about running for president in 2020
The Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, stated on Saturday that he would "reasonably think" about the presidential election after the mid-election.
In a public meeting in Golioc, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of presenting her candidature.
According to The Hill Warren, "It's time for women to go to Washington and get the government done, and for that to happen, there must be a woman in charge."
"After the 6th of November, I will seriously consider putting my name on the presidency."
In a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her assessment of Donald Trump's presidency, saying that he "will lead his country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank, critical of Trump and his offer of a Supreme Court judge, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a Friday tweet, Warren wrote, "...there's no doubt that the FBI has to investigate before voting."
However, according to the Friday poll, most Warren voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey conducted jointly by the Center for Political Studies of the University of Saffelka and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential Massachusetts voters expressed their opposition to the senator's nomination.
Thirty-two percent supported the promotion.
The survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, and 38 percent of the potential presidential nomination was against 48 percent.
In discussions about other famous democracies who can run in 2020, they're also called former Vice-President Joe Byden and senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Byden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Paylin mentions PTSD Trek Paylin at a rally to support Donald Trump
Trek Paylin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through now, and what he's going through on his return, can only understand other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers come home," she said to the rallyers in support of Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Paylin called Trek's arrest "a problem that no one's paying attention to" and said that her son and other veterans of the war "come home less than they used to be, more cruel, and want to know if they respect what the soldiers, the pilots and other military personnel of that country have done to them."
According to the spokesman of the Vasilla Police Department, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as for obstructing reports of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol.
18 states and districts in Colombia support a policy of asylum
Eighteen states and circuits in Colombia have supported a challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying refugee status to victims of banditry and domestic violence.
According to the NBC News, 18 states and districts sent an analytical note by a court consultant to Washington to support a plaintiff who needed asylum and tried the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sachnes' case for the American Civil Rights Union's claim against federal policy, which was filed in August, is not disclosed.
The plaintiff stated that her partner "and his brutal banked sons" had beaten her, but U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace's claim stated that people in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees who often seek asylum in the United States) often face serious problems, such as banditry and domestic violence.
A new policy of refugee status repeals the 2014 Immigration Appeal Council’s decision that undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence could seek asylum.
The Attorney-General of the District of Colombia, General Carl Reissin, declared during his Friday speech that the new policy was "distorting decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that the decisions on the application for refugee status be based on a review of the facts and circumstances set forth in the application, and the prohibition is in violation of that principle”, is stated in an analytical note by a court consultant.
And then in an analysis note, prosecutors argue that policies that prohibit immigrants from entering the U.S. are damaging to the economy, because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill the necessary labour resources."
The general prosecutor, Jeff Sachns, issued an order in June for immigration judges saying that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
"The shelter is provided to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in certain social groups or political views," said Sachns during the presentation of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers desperately seek to locate survivors while the number of those killed in Palu has doubled.
For those who have survived, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with fever at the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances bring bodies.
There's not enough clean water."
Some people return to their destroyed homes and take over their underground possessions in an effort to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 points on the Richter scale are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including two with a fractured back and shoulder, are resting near the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are helped under the open sky by repeated impulses.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled how a strong shock shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was sometimes no escape.
I think I'm stuck in the debris of the wall," said Geris to an Associated Press reporter, adding that he and his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry out for help, and then the silence reigned.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “exercising psychological pressure” through “advertising ads”
A week after the Chinese national newspaper posted an ad on four pages of the American daily magazine on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to promote propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's pay-as-you-go app in Das Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa after China was accused of trying to influence the elections to Congress on November 6, and China rejects these charges.
According to Reuters, U.S. officials, Trump's statements, in which he accuses Beijing of attempting to intervene in American elections, mean a new phase of escalation from Washington, D.C., whose goal is pressure on China.
Although foreign governments can post advertising to boost trade, between Beijing and Washington, D.C., for the time being, there's an escalation of commercial war in which they've already raised customs for imports.
Experts from China and the United States said that early in this war, the introduction of repressive customs in China was meant to strike at exporters from states like Iowa who supported the Republican Trump Party.
Terry Brenstead, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, China’s largest agricultural exporter, claimed that China had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in the column of the Sunday Des Moines Register, "enhancing the pressure by publishing propaganda ads in our independent press."
"To promote propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American people's road to the tradition of freedom of speech and independence of the press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstead.
"In contrast, on street layouts here in Beijing, you will find only the individual voices of dissenting people, and you will not see the true reflection of what the Chinese people actually think about the development of the Chinese economy, which is a matter of concern, where you can conclude that Chinese media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the important Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but he didn't say which one.
Analytics warn that Cavanaugh collapses are putting female voters against themselves before mid-elections.
Since many prominent Republicans support and defend a candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice, Brett Cavanaugh, after several charges of sexual harassment have been brought against him, analysts warn that this may cause an undesirable reaction before future mid-elections, especially in women.
The situation is surrounded by passions, and most Republicans publicly say they would like to move on to the vote.
And then you can't just play back," said during an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Rigger, a professor of political science at Maxwell Searakuz University.
Riger expressed doubt that the investigation of the FBI, at which Senator Jeff Flake (a citizen from Arizona) insisted at the last minute, would be enough to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the chief adviser and spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, Katherine Jean-Perire, on Friday, said, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning the protesters sang "Listaus coming!" during a demonstration in the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move on to confirm the Cavanaugh's candidature despite Dr. Christine Blazee Ford's testimony.
In an interview with Stew Rottenberg's news website, a non-partisan political columnist, he said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They say this is right now, and it's true.
But motivation can increase, especially in women voters aged 18-29 years from suburbs who haven't yet been defined and often don't vote if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford testified in connection with charges of being a Supreme Court judge for sexual offences, analysts predicted that the voters would react negatively if the Republicans insisted on confirmation.
As reported by the NBC News, earlier this week Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, said, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
According to a news channel interview, the director of the U.S. Priorities USA (a group that helps in the electoral campaign for democracies) Guy Cecil, "it's not about voting a committee, voting a final vote, or Cavanaugh being on the dock, but about how they reacted and how they acted."
However, America's views on whose testimony to believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, were divided, and Ford has a little more support.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41 percent of the respondents believe or rather believe in Ford's testimony, but at the same time Cavanaugh's testimony believes or rather believes 35 percent of the respondents.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that they thought Cavanaugh was probably giving false testimony, whereas 30 percent of the respondents said the same about Ford.
The Guardian magazine reports that after being urged by Flake the FBI, it checks the charges made by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramírez.
Last week Ford testified under the oath of the Senate's Legal Committee about Cavanaugh's assault on her while under the influence of alcohol when she was 17.
Ramirez stated that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitalia at a party at Yale University in the 1980s.
The Internet's inventor is planning to launch a new Internet to create a competition between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new startup to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last technology legend project, Inrupt, is in the process of developing an open source platform called Solid's, which is called Berners-Li.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and whom to access information.
In an exclusive interview, Last Company Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt is "world domination."
'We must do it now,' he said about the startup. –
It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create "personal online data store" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of current things, a calendar, an audio library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Space simultaneously in one browser.
A unique feature of this personal online data store is that it fully meets the needs of the user, who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities with data."
According to Director - General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to use resources, processes, and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
So far, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, a few full-time developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can make their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team didn't negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to do a complete replacement when all of their business models were undergoing major changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Lee, the Inrupt mission "ensure commercial energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee is an influential figure in the debate over network neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt Berners-Lee, he remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm looking very optimistic at the next network age," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vanne: Celebration on the presentation of a church representative to the Order of the Cross of Victoria during World War I
The only representative of the Church of England who was given the order of "The Cross of Victoria" for participating in the fighting during World War I is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vanne was awarded an award to participate in the attack at Belglis and Leocour on September 29, 1918.
However, he died four days later from a sniper bullet, and he never learned that he had received Britain’s highest military reward.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vanne, called it "extraordinarily symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the victory for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vane transferred his Battalion across St. Catherine's channel "a very dense fog and under the dense fire of field guns and machine guns."
Later, he hurried to the point of fire and, with "the desperate courage", led the line forward, and before that one broke into the field gun and destroyed the three cannons of the hostile unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vanne said that his grandfather did something he could never have done and deserves to be respected.
He and his brother Dr. James Vanne placed a crown after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial You Band.
Michael Vanne said that "he feels very proud of participating in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero shows the honor that so many people have shown him."
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but they were shown "Pepp's Lead" instead.
Imagine that you're not sleeping all night just to watch Bellator 206's event-rich tournament, and you're not allowed to watch the main event.
There were 13 fights in the posters of the San José tournament, including six matches of the main program, which were broadcast live at night in Britain on five channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, just before Hegard Moussey and Rory McDonald were preparing to get together, the TV viewers in Britain died in surprise when Pep's lead appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting.
Some spectators were not thrilled because they did not sleep until the morning, waiting to fight.
One fan wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him "some sort of a bad joke."
"In accordance with the government's decree, the content broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they had to make child transmission," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and public relations with Bellator, when asked about television,
"Pepp's pig," yes.
Bellator’s president, Scott Coker, promised to work on a broadcast schedule to reach viewers in Britain in the future.
"I think if we talk about recasting, we can arrange it," said Coker.
"Well, it's Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we can't do anything until we have a Sunday and they have a Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we had a lot of messages that we were answering, and the text was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to eliminate it.
However, it was found to be in conflict with governmental regulations.
I can promise you that it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to send a signal to the fans, but we've put these attempts on hold.
It's a really bad situation."
Desert Islanddiscs: Tom Daley felt "bader" than others because of his sexual orientation.
The Olympic jumper in the water, Tom Daley, tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't understand that "not everyone looks like him" until he went to high school.
As he took part in the transfer of Desert Islanddiscs to Radio 4, led by Laurent Laverne, he said that he had made a frank statement about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also stated that because of parental care, there was less concern for winning the Olympic Games.
The chairman, Kirsty Young, has been in the hospital for several months for a long time.
Having come as a couple to Lover's first program, Daley said he felt "bader" than others when he was a kid, because "society didn't look good when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "So far, the feeling of inferiority and distinction has been exactly what has given me the strength and the strength to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove that something was worth while so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone who had finally learned about his orientation.
A two-time bronze Olympic player became a prominent player for the rights of the LBGT community and took advantage of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was frank about his views, because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and he wanted to give that hope to others.
A three - time world champion admitted that his feelings for a man, American film director Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013, were a surprise to him.
Daily married an Oscar laureate, 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that age differences were never a problem.
"When you go through so many things at such a young age," (at the first Olympics, he was performing at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also have experienced such fall and fall.
In June, a son, who was called Robert Rey Black Daily, appeared in marriage, and since then, according to Daley, his "worldly perception" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd only think about what gold should get," he said.
"You know, there are things far more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named Robert's father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said that his father could not accept the idea of the end and asked if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't sit in the front row because you won't be around," said Daley.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not unconquerable," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and obtained bronze.
"I knew it was what I had hoped for my whole life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that," she said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song — Proud (Gord) in the performance of Heather Smol — which resonated with him in preparation for the Olympic Games and still provokes ants.
The Desert Islanddiscs program is released on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 English Summer Time.
On Saturday, Michaelson, who wasn't in uniform, was taken out of the Kubok Ryder match.
American Phil Michaelson's record on Sunday by playing his 47th Kubok Ryder tournament, but he has to restore his uniform so that he doesn't get unhappy.
Michaelson, who for the last 12 times participates in a tournament once every two years, led Captain Jim Furick out of the game during the fort and forks.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he often did in playing for the United States, the five-time winner has been encouraging the team all day and has been training himself side by side, hoping to control his emotions.
Because Michaelson wasn't famous for being hit properly even in his career, a 48-year-old athlete wasn't quite suitable for a complicated golf course for Le Holf National, where Raf is usually punished for wandering blows.
And if the field isn't that bad, the ninth match on Sunday, Michaelson, will have to meet with Francesco Molinari's Open Championship and Master's overall hitman, who won all his matches this week, coupled with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans who fall behind three points after 12 single matches start well, Michaelson's match can be decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his athlete, and he probably had nothing to add to it.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on my back, hugged me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furick.
"He has no doubt in his power.
Michaelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, which has done so much for teams this past week and this week.
I guess I didn't think he'd play two games.
I predicted more matches, but that's what happened, and we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anyone else."
If Michaelson goes to the field on Saturday, he'll break the record of Nick Faldo, who played the largest number of games in the Kubok Ryder tournament.
That's where he might end his career at the Kubok Ryder tournament, which never matched his individual achievements.
In Michaelson's account, 18 wins, 20 failures, and 7 night results, but Furick said that his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
"He's funny, he's mean, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's
"I think the younger players had a good time finding him, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big break does not solve anything.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a marked break in front of the solitary games of the last day's Kubok Ryder tournament does not yet guarantee victory.
Dutch debuted in 1997 in a match at the Valderram Club, where a team led by Cev Ballesteros took five points ahead of the Americans, but won a match with a slight break with a result of 141°2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in the game in the Valderrama field; a big break in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the Valderram field where we won hard," said Bjorn after watching the winning games of Class 2018, with the result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at Le Gold National Stadium, followed by a break of 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing is solved.
We have to play with maximum return tomorrow.
Go to the field and do what is necessary.
The game will not be over until the result is on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I'm focusing on 12 players in our team, but we're well aware of who we're facing, the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a complicated field, Bjorn added, "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow things might be different.
We have individual matches waiting for us tomorrow, which is something else.
It's cool playing the field with your partner when everything's going well, but it's when you're standing there alone, and you can test what you're worth as a golfist.
Here's how to configure players to speak tomorrow: at the limit of their capabilities.
You leave your partner without support and now he has to show you what he can do."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number, Jim Furick expects his partners to play better on an individual level, except for Jordan Spat and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
To Furika's very last day, fate was coming back on different sides: he was among the winners in Brookline, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created "Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 command, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as was done in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative goes to someone else’s side, the players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We put players on the team accordingly, as if we were going to, like, do something incredible tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to try to lead a counterattack against Rory Macilroy, and then on the first half of the European teams, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Paulter.
"These partners themselves, and in this order, I chose because I wanted to share my efforts evenly throughout the game," Bjorn commented on his choice of players in individual matches.
The introduction of a new German warship was again delayed
The most up-to-date frigate of the German Navy was scheduled to be operational as early as 2014 instead of the old Cold War war battleships, but according to local media, this will not happen by the next year because of broken systems and rapid cost increases.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, received from the spokesman of the military office, the opening of the Rhineland-Palatitz ship, the main ship in the series of the most up-to-date Braden-Württemberg frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Würtemberg ships, which the naval office ordered in 2007, are supposed to replace the old Bremen frigates.
Understandably, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of antiaircraft and antiship missiles, as well as some reduced visibility technologies, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance period, and it is expected that the new frigates will not be able to return to the base port for about two years.
However, journalists from Die Zeit warn that because of the constant delay, super modern warships that would increase Germany’s military capacity in the sea will also become obsolete when they are put into service.
A long-suffering frigate F125 came into the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to enter into operation and returned it to the Blohm + Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that a warship has returned to the ship’s construction company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned the significant "hardware and equipment effects" that rendered a warship unusable for military operations.
Software failures are particularly significant, because the Baden-Württemberg crew is made up of about 120 sailors -- only half the number of military personnel who served on the old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the vessel has a significant excess of weight, making its performance worse and limiting the possibilities for further modernization.
The Reynland-Phaltz frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides broken equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which includes the cost of training the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros turned into huge 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion).
The problems of getting new frigates have gained particular importance in the light of recent warnings of the collapse of the German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, the authorized Bundestag on Armed Forces, Hans-Peter Bartels, reported that the Navy of the country “has left very few vessels capable of carrying out combat tasks”.
The official stated that the situation had deteriorated for some time, as the old ships had been decommissioned and the new ones had not arrived.
He expressed deep regret that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates had been able to refill the Navy.
The National Trust will observe the secret life of bats
A new study on land ownership in the Scottish Highlands aims to determine how bats use landscapes in search of food.
Scientists hope that this data will help to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to ensure their preservation in the future.
In Investor Gardens in West Russia, National Trust scientists in Scotland will observe such species as dwarf netopir and Pygmies netopir, as well as the ear of a common and watery night.
Special recordrs will be located in strategic locations in the land area to monitor bats behavior during the season.
National Trust workers and volunteers in Scotland will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and belonging of bats ’ cries.
Then we plan to develop a detailed map of animal habitats and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a nature - protection adviser in Scotland National Trusts, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of conservation measures (such as meadow formation) and to determine how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the last century, bats have declined significantly in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened by extensive construction and reconstitution of areas that deprive them of nesting grounds.
Other negative factors include wind and lighting, glued fly paper, chemical treatment of building materials, and cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, by hunting at night, their ears are more effective in helping them to catch prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles to flight patterns.
In Scotland’s National Trust, which cares for over 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 acres [76 000 ha] of land throughout the country, bats are taken seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly investigate, inspect nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, and it's located in the city of Trive in the Damfries and Galloway region, and eight of the 10 species of bats that live in Scotland have found shelter.
The city manager, David Thompson, claims it's an ideal place for them.
"In the territory of the town, there were excellent conditions for bats," he said.
"Here are old buildings, many huge trees and other favourable living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot more about bats, thanks to the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we're going to be able to learn more about what they need to be able to do."
He insists that it's very important to check the area for bats before doing any technical work, because because of the unintentional destruction of one nesting site, a young woman may die as many as 400 females with babies, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats and their nests are protected by law.
Elizabeth Ferrella, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Center, urged the public to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we haven't yet discovered the characteristics of many species of populations."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape and his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against the German edition
Kristianu Ronalda called the charges of rape "cancer" and claimed that people "try to attract attention" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information about the suspicions.
Katherine Major has been accused by American woman Catherine Major of having raped the Forward of the Portuguese Collective and the Juventus football club, which happened in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
As Der Spiegel reported on Friday, Ronalda allegedly paid her $375,000 for her silence.
A few hours after the charges were filed, 33-year-old Ronalda turned to 142 million fans on video broadcasts in Instagram, calling them "no-show."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's charges are slander," the five-time Lord of the Golden Ball.
"They want to attract attention by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to make a profit of me, but situations like this are part of my job.
I'm a happy person and I'm fine," added a football player smiling.
According to Reuters news agency, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for published charges, which they call "an impermissible report of privacy suspicion."
Lawyer Christian Shertz stated that the football player would demand compensation for "moral damage in size that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious cases of violation of personal rights in recent years."
It is said that the incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at a nightclub in Ronald and Majorg, he returned to the player’s number, where he allegedly committed an anal rape, which was handed over to the District Court of Clarke County, Nevada.
Major claims that after the incident described by Ronaldo fell on his knees and said that he was "99 percent good guy" and "one percent."
As noted in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with a model, but with mutual consent.
Major also claims that she turned to the police and then to the hospital where the injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to a foreign settlement because she was afraid of revenge and was careful of "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel the previous deal because she continues to suffer from the incident she says happened.
At the time of the incident, Ronald was preparing to move to the FC Real Madrid from the Manchester United, and this summer, he became an Italian football grandman, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain will "long-term regret" for the loss of manufacturers
The U.K. will be forever sorry if we lose the status of world automotive leader after Brexit.
He added that he was thrilled by the announcement by Toyota UK that if Britain withdraws from the EU without a deal, the company would have to suspend its production and operation in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Minister Clark assures us.
A Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the effects of delays at the border in the case of Brexit without a contract could cost jobs.
A factory in Bernaston that produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars released about 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain temporarily leaves the EU by the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, Director General of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about the impact of Britain's exit from the EU without agreement on international trade.
For example, BMW stated that a mini-model factory in Oxford would be closed one month after BMW.
The main concerns of manufacturers are that Brexit without a deal can create risks for supply chains.
The Toyota production line operates in the rapid delivery of parts and materials according to needs – details come from suppliers in Britain and the EU every 37 minutes for ordered cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, the border may be broken by the supply of details, resulting in delays and shortages of materials.
As the company points out, Toyota can contain no more than one day's detail, so the production has to stop.
Greg Clark noted that in organizing relations with the EU, prepared by Shequers Plan, “in particular, there are plans to avoid problems at the border”.
"We need an agreement, we need an optimal agreement that I think will enable not only success at this moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have emerged," he said during the program that day on the TV station BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's representatives, as well as other auto manufacturers, we need to preserve the established high-performing supply chains."
Toyota was unable to report how long the production would be stopped, but in the long run, it's expected that increased costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and result in jobs being reduced.
Peter Tsvalaris, chairman of the Unite professional union at the Bernaston factory, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants were extremely concerned, "I can tell you from experience that shorter jobs are not being restored."
The representative of the government said, "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan to form our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, noted in the White House
According to White House officials on Sunday, Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week" while discussions continued on the nomination of Brett Cavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's interference with elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the potential interference with justice by the President.
For several months in Washington, D.C., the possibility of the release of a deputy attorney general who would jeopardize Muller’s independence is under discussion.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had commented on the use of microphones to record discussions with Trump and the possibility of the early termination of President's powers under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House in the background of reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he didn't "want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a time coincidence with the Senate Legal Committee meeting, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation into charges against Cavanaugh, which further suspended the Senate vote.
The Spokesperson for Trump, Sarah Sanders, performed on Fox News Sunday.
And when she asked questions about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "It's not scheduled to be held this week, and maybe it's going to be held this week, and I'm expecting her to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I'm constantly making sure that the press has up-to-date information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not conduct a briefing for the White House media since September 10.
The chairman, Chris Wallace, asked why.
And Sanders said, "I'm not going to deny that they're playing for the public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
"The president gives answers to questions more often than any president before him," she said, adding, without reference to the source, "Statistics speaks for itself."
Saunders noted that the briefings will still be held, but "if the press is able to ask the President of the United States, that's better than talking to me."
We're trying to communicate with the press a lot, and it's going to be particularly visible in the last few weeks, and the ability to talk to the U.S. president is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences with high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York City this week, the president may have shown why this is the case by acting in front of journalists, and sometimes strangely.
Scottish State Secretary of Health addressed a letter to EU employees for concerns over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to citizens of other EU countries who work at the Scottish National Health Service to express their appreciation for their work and to ask them to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already made a commitment to cover the cost of applications for permanent resettlement status for EU citizens working in autonomous government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman stated: “The British and the EU have been engaged in discussions over the summer on the issue of exit, and decisions must be taken in this autumn.
But the British government is strengthening preparations for a possible solution without a deal.
I know this period can be very disturbing to you.
That's why I'd like to emphasize again how much I appreciate the contribution of every worker, regardless of nationality.
Friends from across the European Union and beyond share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving the health service for patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay."
Christian Ebercrombie suffered an emergency operation after head injury
Christion Ebercrombie, a member of the Tennessee State Tigers team, was subjected to an urgent operation after receiving head injuries in Sunday's match against Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team lost on account 31:27.
The main coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told reporters that the player had been injured shortly before the break.
"He came up to the side line where he got angry," said Reed.
At the side line, coaches and medical personnel gave Ebercrombies oxygen before taking it away for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State Tigers told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nasville, Tennessee, that Ebercrombie was operating at the University of Wandabilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "until there's any evidence of the type and severity of the injury," the Tennessee State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a fellow student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after moving from Illinois.
He made five grabs on Sunday before leaving the game, so in the season he's got 18 grabs.
Foreign buyers will pay more government tax if they acquire real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more tribute if they acquire real estate in Britain, and according to Tori's new plans, additional costs will be spent on helping the homeless.
This takes away all Corbin's attempts to involve young voters

In the Ministry of Finance, an additional £120 million a year is expected to be invested to help the homeless
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners buying real estate in Britain will pay more money, and additional funds will be spent to help the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to involve young voters with promises of more affordable housing targeted at high-paid workers.
The increase in the tax will involve individuals and legal entities who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the government will aim to help those who have to sleep under the open heavens.
An additional custom, accompanied by a two - year - old promotion to a second dwelling and real estate, may be three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, an additional £120 million per year is expected.
Experts estimate that 13 percent of the new real estate that is being built in London is owned by foreign citizens, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for people who just dream about their own housing.
Many rich areas of the country, particularly in the capital, are empty, since large numbers of foreign buyers live most of the time outside the country.
The new plan of action was only a few weeks after Boris Johnson had called for a lower state tax to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying land without further use of it, and he urged Theresa May to give up the quota of available real estate to correct the "unlawful position in the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of important real estate reforms, such as rent control and the denial of eviction without good reason.
He also suggests expanding the powers of local councils in the area of building new housing.
Theresa May said, "Last year, I promised that I would dedicate my premier to restoring a British dream -- every new generation of life must be better.
This requires changes in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will remain open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in Britain and foreign companies buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become unattainable, and the problem of living under the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "I want to be the main coach of collective Scotland."
Jack Ross, chief coach of the SC Sanderland, claims that "most of all" will ever lead Scotland's team.
A 42-year-old Scottish man started rebuilding a club from the northeast of the country, which is now third in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stedium of Light this summer, returning the last season of St. Mirren's CC to Scotland's Prime League.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to Scotland's second team, but it's over," Ross told the program on the "Sportsound" on the BBC Scotland radio.
"When I was a kid, my father and I used to watch the game at Hempden Park in Scotland.
The only hope for me is to be successful as the lead trainer of the club."
Ross' predecessors at the Sanderland CC were Dick Lawyer, David Mois, Sam Ellardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy King, Gustavo Piot and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach of the FC, the "Alloy Atletic", claims that he didn't feel excited about moving into a big club after such authoritative names, before he rejected the proposals from the "Barnsley" and "Ipsvith Town."
"At the current stage, I think I'm successful if the club goes back to the Prime League.
Thanks to its structure and material and technical support, this club no doubt corresponds to the level of the Prime League," he said.
"It's going to be a tough task, but the other thing I don't think I'm going to do is think I'm going to be successful."
Ross has only been building a career as a coach for three years, and he's been a second coach at the Dambarton FK, and he's spent 15 months at the FC's Garths Training Staff.
And then he helped Aloy to get on his way after the FK got to the third Division, and in the next season from St. Mirren, he went from the flight stage to gaining the title of the winners of the first Division.
According to Ross, he's more comfortable now than he's ever had during his game career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Volkerk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"I've been at the intersection," he recalls when he was talking about going to the "Alloy."
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more appropriate for me than playful.
It sounds strange because I've been successful, I've made a good living and I've reached a certain height.
But it's not easy to play.
There are many challenges that have to be overcome each week.
I still face them under stress and stress, but as a master trainer, I feel where I am.
I've always been interested in training, and I've never felt as comfortable in my adult life as I did in choosing this profession."

Research: 17:30 Sunday is the perfect time for a cup of beer
Summer heat has helped to increase revenue for British pubs, which are not the best of times, but have increased the pressure on restaurants.
According to calculations, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, while profits in restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The author of the calculations, Peter Martin, of CGA, who is involved in business advice, said, "The rewards of solar weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup, July passed according to the same pattern as the previous month, when the proceeds of pubs grew by 2.8 percent, and then the restaurants got worse.
June drop was 1.8 percent higher in July.
Peas and bars, which are targeted at drinking, have the best performances so far – increasing their profits is equivalent to losing restaurants.
The pubs in which the food is served were also affected by the heat, but not as much as the restaurants.
The only thing that seems to interest visitors is drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales decreased by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM, said, "Such trends have been observed since the end of April.
Weather and large - scale social or sports events continue to be major factors affecting sales in the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, groups of restaurants continue to lose profits, and the annual decline in sales by 4.8% is particularly disturbing in the face of the need to cut costs.
The long, hot summer is not the best time for food-supplied facilities, and we'll see if the moderater temperature we saw in August can give them such needed rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new institutions, in July was 2.7 percent, reflecting the slowing of brands into the market.
A corporate indicator of the sales of Coffer Pach Tracker in Britain's pubs, bars, and restaurants is a reflection of the collected and analysed productivity of 47 working groups, whose aggregate sales exceed 9 billion pounds, a generally accepted industry standard.
1 out of 5 children has a social networking account hidden from their parents
A study showed that 1 out of every 5 children, sometimes under 11 years of age, has hidden social networking accounts from parents and teachers
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram
This news raised concerns about possible sexual content placement
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "core account" they showed their parents
One in five children, sometimes under the age of 11, creates an account on social networks that hides them from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram, a social network for the exchange of photographs.
This news raised concerns about possible sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "core" account that they showed their parents and one or more private ones.
A mother who accidentally came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret page saw a call for "rape me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conferences (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two identities in social networks. Half of these children recognized that the additional account was secret.
The head of the HMC association, Mike Buchanan, said, "We're very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel they want to create an online space in which parents and teachers can't find them."
Alyd Doyle will be a "representative of the Athletics" for the Scottish Athletics Council
Alyd Doyle is elected to the Council of Scotty Athletics as an independent director during the annual general board of board members.
Doyle is a found-in-the-blank Scottish pup, and the chairman of the council, Ian Beatty, called this a great opportunity for those who lead sports, to take advantage of its extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Alyde has great respect among the athletes of Scotland, Great Britain and the world, and we're confident that by bringing her to the council, athletic sports in Scotland will be of great benefit," Beatty said.
Doyle said, "I'm inspired to act as an athlete, and I hope that I can really benefit and promote sports in Scotland."
The American, a four-time Olympic champion who won a 200- and 400-foot race at the 1996 games in Atlanta and now a BBC sports watcher, has lost the opportunity to walk through a transit ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I would be able to recover and how much.
I have learned to walk again, and I am doing dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for your words of support!"
In advertising for milk suckers, women were compared to cows - Internet users' opinions were divided
The milk sucker manufacturer faced a mixed response from Internet users to an ad in which young mothers are compared to valid cows.
To mark the release of a product called "the world's first quiet domestic milk sucker," Elvie's consumer technology company produced a humorous music video ad to demonstrate the freedom that a new sucker provides to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cow to a song that says, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail" and "As you can see, it's not a spoken word, but my breasts."
And then the chorus goes, "Suck it, suck it, suck it up to feed the children, suck it, suck it, suck it so it doesn't waste milk."
However, an ad published on the company’s Facebook page caused a heated discussion online.
The video got 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the Internet user's response was mixed, and many people noted that the ad undervalued "a terrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
"It's not a very reasonable decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their kids are being taken away from them a few days after they're born," someone wrote.
The Elvie milk sucker can easily be hidden in the feeders (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "I've learned it's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you get them to advertise a milk sucker for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone else said, "This ad is very far from reality."
Other users stood up for a commercial, and one of the women in the video found it "very fun."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would certainly have bought such a thing if I were still breast - feeding.
I felt like a cow as I sucked milk.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I didn't look for hidden meaning in it.
A great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "A funny ad directed at moms that suck up milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This ad is not designed to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk suckers hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women who use such foods feel like cows.
But Elvie's sucker works perfectly quietly, doesn't have wires or tubes, and is easily hidden in a food bra, which allows women to move freely, keep children, and even go outside.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive director of Mother advertising agency, commented on this situation: "Elvie's sucker is so revolutionary that he demanded a bright and provocative presentation.
Having drawn a parallel between the milk-cut women and the real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the characteristics of breast-feeding, in an exciting and interesting way, showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new sucker will bring.
Elvie sucker is not the first time in news headlines.
In London's Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product while showing the clothes from model Marta Yakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children have moved quietly to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, partly because harsh rhetoric and politics on the part of the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children in caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, immigrants themselves were undocumented as caregivers, and now they're afraid to threaten their own ability to stay in the country by offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to print fingerprints and that this data would be transmitted to immigration services.
Last week Matthew Albens, a high-ranking immigration and customs supervisor, testified before Congress that the Bureau staff had arrested dozens of people who had applied for care of minors without escort.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80% of those who are caregivers or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them are foreigners who committed the crime.
So we continue to persecute these people," Mr. Albens noted.
According to asylum workers, in order to deal more quickly with children's cases, officials have introduced new rules that require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, not 60 days.
Many of them will be able to use video-conferencing rather than go to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who are not entitled to asylum by a court order will be deported quickly.
According to asylum workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children are kept in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to an outbreak of violence or an attempt to escape.
Law - enforcement officials claim that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving the children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to friends, we risk increasing the trauma many of them have experienced.
Syria ordered the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw the troops immediately
Moreover, speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Walid Al-Mualom called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country had been at war for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, so "the attitude towards them will be appropriate."
"They must go immediately and not set conditions," he declared at the assembly.
Mualm insisted that the "war on terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The US has deployed some 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Al-Assad.
More than 1,000 soldiers were sent to a war - torn country in France.
As for the refugees, Mualem assured us that there were proper conditions for their return, and he accused some Western countries of "promising unfounded fears" that prevented refugees from returning.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to help people come back," he said.
"We see an attempt to politicize a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not assist Syria in rebuilding the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to ending the war.
The UN diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around the Idlib, the last great fence of the rebels, has created the possibility of continuing political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish Agreement, the Syrian forces supported by Russia have been able to prevent a large-scale attack on a province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had clear terms, and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including fighting fighters associated with Al-Qaida to the Al-Nusra Front, who would be destroyed.
UN Emissary Staffan de Mistura expects to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and opposition, in order to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and create conditions for the holding of elections.
Mualem put the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, stating that its work should be limited to “review of articles of a valid constitution”, and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected
This logic suggests that Trump may be re-elected in 2020, if, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, he does not form the mandate soon after the scandal and impeachment.
No doubt it would be "the most dramatic conclusion of the presidency in all time."
At the moment, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of prime time viewers has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and has actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, there are 2.4 million prime-time viewers in Fox News on average, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddown Show on the MSNBC cable channel is at the top of a rating of 3.5 million viewers on the evenings when the main news is being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our comprehension," said Neil Behr, executive producer of the "Last Nomine" drama on ABC channel about the Secretary of State becoming president after the destructive attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced Humorist writer and author of the book "Only Fun Things: A Several Strict Truths About the Enterion of Hollywood Men," offers another theory.
She recalled a trip to Boston’s taxi before the elections in 2016.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's laughing at me," he said, "that's what Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington stories are able to determine the future of Row vs. Wade, the possibility of reuniting immigrant families, and the state of the world economy.
Departure is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it can't be said that you're just trying to remain informed citizens when you've been watching for six hours a group of experts discussing Bob Woodworth's use of "well-informed" sources for his book Fear, Paul Manaforth's leather jacket for $15,000, and the results of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy published by Storm Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
"The sense of reality is partly related to the fact that you are fed every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive director of WeelhouseStep and author of the "Stars of the Brombard" television program, about the rotations in the acting room and the daily narratives of the "Tramp" show.
If you allow yourself to miss at least one episode, you're hopelessly behind.
When this week I was able to meet Mr. Blaise in his house on the north coast of the island of Cauai, there was warm sun weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't break free from the TV – not when Brett Cavanaugh appeared before the Senate Legal Committee, but the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
"I remember when we were making all those crazy shows, and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flage told me.
"I took it as a joke, but they seemed to be right."

Externalization of funds into the toughest mid-elections to Congress
It's not surprising that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, additional cash injections are being sent, because through a survey of the electoral districts, two valid congressmen are competing for one chair.
The struggle for this suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, is a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives, Conor Lemb, who won another district in the extra election last spring.
Lemb stands in opposition to another valid congressman, the Republican Kit Rothfs, who now represents the old 12th county of Pennsylvania, whose borders largely coincide with the new 17th.
The maps were reworked after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts had been defined in favour of the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
Pre-elections in the new 17th district caused fierce opposition between the financial units of the major parties, the United States Democratic Party Committee for Congress Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
The name Lemba became very well known in Pennsylvania after the 18th district won with minimal advantage during the additional elections in Congress in March, which enjoyed public attention.
President Donald Trump won this district with 20 points.
Political experts have given little priority to democracies.
The U.S. considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but they changed their mind.
Diplomats recalled the weakness of Washington’s resistance to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June of 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with Panama's president, Juan Carlos Varela, and Trump also had a hotel in Panama before his partners withdrew staff hired by Trump Organization.
The officials of the Department of State decided to withdraw the heads of United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama through "the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognization," announced by the Spokesperson of the Department of Gezer Neuert earlier this month.
But the sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, particularly in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful to this Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
According to the results of the internal conference, officials from the Americas postponed the conference at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, which took place last year, and was viewed as a step forward in efforts to curb the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and in fact, at this point, the question of sanctions against El Salvador had stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pens is now planning to address a conference that is scheduled to take place in mid-October, as a sign that the administration considers this event very important.
At the same time, three U.S. messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, since there were no more severe reports or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's representative in the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that had been reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, under the conditions of anonymity.
The information provided was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the conditions of anonymity.
Study History
The next problem may be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Muller about possible interference with justice by Trump, which can be found in the public information currently available.
According to reports, as part of his investigation, Muller is checking the possible connection between the Trump campaign and the attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the impact of the Congress goes into other hands, Trump will have to be reported to the conventioners, just as it will to the voters and eventually to the one - party population.
There's a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't mean to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, like his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup d’état against Hitler, if only the West were to oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to escape bloodshed.
History's progress is driven by these turning points, and the uncontrolled movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
There's a couple of these turning points for the Americans right now.
What will we do if Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person on whom Mr. Muller's fate depends?
Rosenstein was in trouble when this paper reported last year that he was offering to secretly record his conversations with the president and share his thoughts on Trump's dysfunction.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
"How will we react if the investigation of the Britta Cavanaugh case recently launched by the FBI is not sufficiently thorough or honest, or if Cavanaugh's candidate for office in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite convincing accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And first of all, will we vote in the medium term for those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, bad times will come to democracy.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jewish who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my Embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With that legacy, can I not look forward with optimism?"

Graham Durrans of Rangers looks forward to meeting with the Vienna Rapod.
The Rangers F.C. takes "Rapid" (Vienna) Thursday, and after an amazing night in Spain playing with Willarreal at the beginning of this month, winning over the Austrians will provide the Scottish Club with a good chance of getting out of Group G of the League of Europe.
Because of the trauma, half-defense defender Graham Durrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a game with Willarreal, which ended with count 2:2, but he believes that the "Raings" FK can use this result as a springboard to achieve more.
"It was a good result for us, because Willarreal is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out on the game hoping to get at least something and got one point.
Maybe at the end of the match, we could go forward, but in general, nothing can possibly be considered a fair result.
In the first half of the day, the opponent was better, but after a break we fixed the situation for our benefit.
On Thursday, another major opposition will take place in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not easy, and our future competitors have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on the support of the fans, and I'm sure we can fight and get a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself, but the situation has now been normalizing.
We have a great warehouse, and all the guys are happy.
I hope we can move on, leave behind the last season and succeed."
Women are losing their sleep for fear of retirement savings
Although the surveyers had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few people talked about it with their family.
About half the people who were involved in a survey of the Nationside company said that they were talking to their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked about it with the kids.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not in a hurry to have a conversation about this," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationalside Life Insurance Unit.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your husband or your wife and your children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care if you do not inform your parents of your wishes in advance.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to get care, because it can be an important factor in determining cost.
Include a financial adviser, who may recommend a way to cover the associated costs.
The funding sources for long - term care include traditional insurance policies, hybrid life insurance policies, or self - security at the expense of your own (if you have money).
Prepare your legal documents carefully, which will help you to avoid legal hardship in advance.
Prepare your confidence for a representative who will monitor your medical care and ensure that experts comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to do so personally.
We also recommend that you develop trust in money management.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills if you are ineligible.

In Ilfracum, a man fired a few shots from a pneumatic rifle
The man fired a pneumatic rifle several times as he returned home from the party.
A 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracum, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach, and hand.
The officers described the shooting that took place at 02:30 a.m. British summer time as "Rate."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds are not life - threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Disasters and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, reports by government authorities, but the number of casualties can increase.
Because of the break-up of the communications system, humanitarian officials can't get any information from the Dougal Regent, a region north of Palau, which is closer to the 7.5-point magnitude epicenter of the earthquake.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palau.
Consider a few basic facts about the city of Palau on the island of Sulawesi and the Dongal Regent.
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800, according to figures for 2017.
When the tsunami earthquake struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regeneracy that extends over 300 km (180 miles) along a coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
According to a 2017 census, about 299,200 people live in an administrative region located in the lower part of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The mining of nickel is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to an Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, the tsunami has hit Palau and Dougal several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, and then nine people died.
Indonesia is located in the seismicly active Pacific flame ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
The following are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
On December 26, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg, located in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in the Aceg province.
2005: At the end of March, in early April, a series of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked the south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, and a tsunami struck the south coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, a 7.6 - magnitude magnitude magnitude earthquake was detected.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - magnitude magnitude earthquake rocked one of the Isles of Mantava, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 30 feet [10 m] high, killing dozens of villages and killing some 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake hit the Edejai Regent in the province of Aceg, causing destruction and panic because people had not forgotten the devastating earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed in the debris of the buildings.
2018: severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless homes, and thousands of tourists were unable to leave the island immediately.
Sarah Paylin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Trek Paylin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and the candidate for Vice-President Sarah Pelin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a Saturday report published by the Alaska State Police, 29-year-old Pelin of Vasili, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing reports of violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Paylin is in custody in Matanuska-Susitna, an insulator with a 500-dollar mortgage.
He was brought before a court on Saturday where he declared himself "innocent," when asked if he confessed his guilt, reported online.
Paylin is charged with three class A misconduct, which involves arrest for up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with class B misconduct, which is punishable by a day's imprisonment and a 2,000-dollar fine.
It is not the first time that Pailin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, and he was obstructing reports of domestic violence and carrying alcohol weapons when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit her on her face.
In 2016, Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups for justifying her son’s violent behavior with post - traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused a tsunami — hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - magnitude earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Networks of communications and electricity are out of operation, and the number of victims can increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of Sulawesi Island, northeastern of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
Videos on social networks show the moment when the elements hit.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palau when the tsunami struck ashore.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City.
In New York City, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saifullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, which resulted in the death of eight people — a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
It's said that in October, 30-year-old Saip, driving a home-dumped pickup truck, went on a bike track along the West Side highway, Lower Manhattan, and started beating up cyclists and pedestrians that happened to him.
In line with the report of the intention to seek execution in the South District of New York State to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intently” killed eight people and “intently” caused serious bodily harm.
According to court records, each of these charges involves the possibility of capital punishment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of the jury charged the Saipov with 22 counts, including eight charges of murder for the purpose of extortion, which federal prosecutors usually charge in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of a motor vehicle.
According to the prosecutors, who described the crime committed by Saipov as "terrorous, cruel and malicious," this attack is the result of "reasonable planning and deliberate planning."
The victims of the injuries, injuries, injuries, and killings of Saiful Habibullawich Saip were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagikko, as described in the intention report.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last death penalty crime was committed in the South District of New York City.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, and was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal death penalty was carried out in New York in 1953, and a couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saip’s court records, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show a guilty conscience in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he was not sorry for what he had done.
According to Saipov’s indictment, he was inspired to carry out a video attack on his phone.
The police report that he also asked for an IDILE flag in his hospital room.
He did not confess guilt for 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" with this decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting confessions of guilt and sentencing life imprisonment without possible release will only increase the psychological trauma caused by these events to all the victims," said Patton.
Saipov’s defense earlier also asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
Member of Parliament of the Conservative Party believes that NAJELA FARAJA should be designated as the negotiator of the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Conservative Party Congress, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the People's Army."
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party stated that politicians should “responsibly feel pressure” from Euroskeptists because one of the deputies of the Parliament, Theresa May, has offered to negotiate with the EU.
Peter Bow, a member of the Conservative Party, claimed on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have done it" if Mr. Faraj were Secretary of Brexit.
The attention to the problems May faced in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks was further attracted by the fact that members of the Conservative Party against the exit joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is working hard to implement the Chequers compromise plan despite attacks by Brexit, against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will not give up trying to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force the Eurosketists and the Laborists to choose between what she suggests and chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihal, Mr. Boone said he wanted to "reject Chequers."
He asked Mr. Faraj to come out of the shadows and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for it, we'd be out," he said.
Wellingborough's secretary added, "I'm supporting Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We didn't fight in the world wars to conform.
We want to pass our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Boone rejected the assumption that after the vote in 2016, public opinion changed, "The idea that the British had changed their mind and didn't want to go out is completely out of the question."
A member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, "Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers' plan is unpopular among the general public, opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists, who are actually walking the streets fighting for voters' votes.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In an address to Theresa May, she added, "Prime Ministers retain their position when they fulfill their promises."
Mr. Faraj said politicians should "receive pressure" if they were going to abandon the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, people and our political elite," he declared.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say that they won't get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, which is planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel under pressure.
We mobilize the national army of this country that will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, opposers passed Birmingham and then held a two - hour rally in the center of the city.
Several activists waved banners of Conservatives v. Brexit when the group was launched this weekend.
Léborist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives because security problems had arisen since the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a full farce.
There's nothing good about Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning "reasonable thinking" about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November election, she was "reservedly thinking of the presidential election."
The Boston Globe reports that during the general assembly in West Massachusetts on Saturday, a representative of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about his future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running in November for a second term against a member of the Republic Party, Jeff Dyll, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is regarded as the main candidate that can fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, her 36th meeting with voters in general assembly format has been held since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to participate in the presidential elections.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and get the government done, and for that to happen, there's going to be a woman on his head."
S.T.S.S.S.S.S.
At the Baton Ruz police in Louisiana, on Saturday, they said that Vaid Sims was arrested on Friday for a gun-killing basketball player.
The police office of Baton-Rose announced the arrest of Dyton Simpson, 20 years old, at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
On Friday, they published a video recording of the shootings asking for help to identify the person on it.
A 20-year-old, Sims, was shot dead at the campus of the University of Sutern on Friday morning.
"Weyd Sims was shot in the head and lost his life," stated the police chief, Murphy J. Paul, on Saturday.
Wade set foot for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found to have been present at the scene of the crime, carrying weapons, and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to police custody in East Baton County.
Sims, who was six feet and six inches tall and who was performing in a U.S. league, grew up in Baton Rose, and he played 32 games with 10 stars in the last season and, on average, spent 17.4 minutes on the field, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Lewis Hemillton reduced the backlog in the world championship struggle after the team had decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the time that Walter Bottas left behind Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes ’ command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well with a pod-possemble and almost went around Hamilton, trying to keep his position on the first two turns and giving Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel set out on a pit-stop first and left Hamilton on a pathway in the tail of a race that should have resolved everything.
Mercedes' pilot drove another circle and went behind Fettel, but Hemilton got into the leadership after a certain wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre, and the result was that the Ferrari driver reluctantly left his internal space because of the risk that he would be squeezed out after being able to escape on a third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstapen started from the back row of the net and stayed seventh until the end of the first circle.
He ran most of the race because he didn't change the tires to quickly come to the finish and move Kimi Ryckonen from fourth place.
He ended up standing on the 44th, but he couldn't increase the pace at the last eight, which made Ryckonen fourth place.
"It's a hard day, because the waltter was put out full on every weekend and showed a grace when he gave me the opportunity to get through.
The team did an exceptional job to take the first and second place," Hemilton said.
The Language of the Body Was Not Impressed
At the meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinsstein for her firm stand that she did not make known the contents of Christine Blaze Ford's letter accusing a candidate to the Brett Cavanaugh Supreme Court of sexual violence.
During a rally in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, but instead expressed his opinion of what was happening in the Senate, which he said was human "disgustingness, disgustingness and lying."
"The only thing that could have happened, and all the wonderful things that have been happening in the last few days in the Senate, is anger, you see the evil people showing meanness, disgustingness and lying," he said.
"You look at publications and public information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feinsstein, did you share information?
Remember her answer... you announced the contents of the documents? – “What?
Oh, no.
I didn't announce."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't,' he added, copying Senator's behavior.
In July, Feynstein received a detailed statement of charges against Cavanaugh, and in early September its contents were announced, but Fainsstein denied that the leak had taken place in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't disclose the information she got," said Fainsstein to the committee, reporting to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promise."
But her objection seems to have displeased the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting, "I'll tell you, the language of her body wasn't at all impressive.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone hold on to worse."
Continuing to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual violence by three women, the president assumed that democracies were using charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power in any necessary way.
You see meanness, disgustingness, they don't care who you insult, who you need to cross to get power and control," Mediaite quotes the president's words.
Elitary League: "Dandy Stars" - "Belafest Jayants" 5:3
Patrick Doyer, a Jayants player, threw two pucks in a match against Dundee.
"Dandy Stars" was rehabilitated for Friday defeat in an elite league from Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 match on Saturday.
"Jayants" was given an early advantage in two pucks thanks to the rolls of Patrick Doyer and Francis Boville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney compared the bill in the home match, and then Doyer took the Jayants forward again.
The Dundee player, François Bushar, compared the score, and Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two heads ensured their victory.
This is the third in the elite league season to defeat the team Adam Kife, who won the voluminous victory over "Dandi" at 2:1 p.m. on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season, and the three previous games were won by the Jayants team.
The first praibu of Doeyer was dropped for the fourth minute (3:35) after he passed Kendall McFall, and after four minutes, Boville, who got the puck from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period of fourteen minutes, Salivian returned the fields to the game, and on the sixteenth minute (15:16), Cooney received a bill from Matt Markwardt.
Doyer gave the Jayants an advantage over the first break by throwing down his second puck at the end of the first period.
The owners of the fields regrouped, and Bouchard again compared the score for twenty - eight minutes (27:37) when his crew outnumbered him.
Thanks to the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he first led the Dundee forward and ensured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday the team "Jayants", which has already lost four of the last five games, is playing an exit match against Milton-Kins.
Air traffic controller killed so that hundreds of people on the plane could escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he had helped to fly with hundreds of people at a cost of his own life.
More than 800 people were killed and many lost their lives after the great tsunami earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Heavy underground shocks continue to rock the area, and many find themselves trapped in the city of Palu.
But unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the air traffic control tower, which was on its way to Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palau.
He stayed in place to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was at the time on the airstrip, had safely risen into the air.
Then he jumped out of the air traffic control tower when he thought it was falling apart.
Later, he died in the hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian air navigation service company, Johannes Siraith, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which is supposed to deliver him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the government is afraid that the number of victims can reach thousands, because the disaster relief agency of the country claims that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims can increase because many bodies are still under debris and many cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached a height of six feet [6 m], devastated the city of Palu, where mass funerals would take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft deliver relief supplies.
Reese Kusum, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News, "Every minute, ambulances bring bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Helfand, chairman of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN, "The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's already a tragedy, but things can get much worse."
President Joko Ododo of Indonesia came to Palau on Sunday and said to the country's military, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?", reports CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on Lombok Island, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: As stated in Air Niugini, after a plane fell into the lagoon, one man disappeared.
An air company that carried out a disaster in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one person has disappeared, although it has previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crews were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated that one passenger could not be found on Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives seek to find a husband and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airlines did not immediately respond to the request for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crews after the plane fell to the water while attempting to land at Chuuk airport.
On Friday, the officials reported that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
At the airline and Navy, the U.S. Navy stated that the plane landed in a lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has crossed the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Janes, said that the plane flew very low above the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told us that he and others managed to get through the emergency exits on a thin plane while lying in the water.
He told me that the stewards panicked and shouted and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the modernization of the dock also helped in a rescue operation by taking people to the shore by means of an inflated boat before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safesty Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents in the past two decades, related to the airlines registered in PNG, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
An analyst restored the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning women from the Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used his cell phone records to replicate the movement of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette, reports The Clarion Ledger, said that he had received data on the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his earlier statement.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when they said that he was in Sanford's pickup that night, Sanford said he was "not really, because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulette explained that shortly after Chambers Tellis died, he removed text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers’s phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Gale said.
The defense must state its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Brad: What is the conscious hip hop?
Trio hip-hop performers want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Brad group from Bristol claims that hip hop has changed its nature - has gone away from political ideas and the struggle to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the source and make a conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugues and the Common have recently witnessed this resurgence in the United Kingdom thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark skin?
In New York City, the nanny filed a couple for release after receiving a "racist" message
In New York City, the nanny sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from the mother complaining that she was "other black."
The couple deny that they're racist, comparing the lawsuit with the demand.
Lancey Placco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw a new nanny, Giselle Morris, who arrived at her first working day in 2016, black.
"No, IT'S A LIGHT FLAXMAN," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flacsman to his husband in a report.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Morris.
As reported in the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Placson-Flaxman felt "inconvenient" and released Miss Morris, and she said that their previous babysitter, who was an African American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a babysitter from the Philippines instead.
Miss Morris was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now she's going to be suing, hoping she's going to get a pay-as-you-go allowance, which she's going to get in six months' work of living with a couple who were initially hired, although without a contract, she'd have to pay 3,500 dollars a day.
"I want to show them that you don't have to do this," she said on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the charges that they were racist, the couple stated that the release of Morris was a wise decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," the Post told her husband Joel Plasco.
'But would you leave your children with a person who was treated harshly, even if it wasn't deliberate?'
Your baby?
HUNGARY."
Comparing a lawsuit to a demand, Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months ago to "not yet settled."
"Would you avenge someone after that?
It's a bad thing," added an investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social networks, critical of their behavior and logic.
According to the new letter, the editors of Padington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a talking bear
The daughter of Bond Karen Jankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was published, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
Now that's funny, because we know about the tremendous success that the Padington story has achieved."
And telling him that her father, who was an operator of BBC before a little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, was optimistic that his work had been rejected, she shared how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release she felt "joy and sadness" at the same time, because his father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was very proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was a rather modest man and didn't like to boast," she said.
"But Padington was so real to him as his own child, because when children achieve something, we are proud of them, though they are not theirs, not ours.
I think he was looking at Padington's success just like that.
Although Padington is the work of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say good-bye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the 2nd Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"Nad regularly called, said everything was really bad, that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Lapers.
"And then over phoned me and said she would die in the next two minutes and I should say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Pashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating gradually stopped and came out of her body.
She died some time before everything was shut down.
I had to sit and wait knowing what was going on at that time.
I couldn't get bored or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
She had to really keep herself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who was grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, ignoring the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I lost my head and couldn't hold back my tears.
This is hard to explain, but it was during my flight that I began to feel deep sympathy for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave a card to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave a phone - number card on the Wally Bridge for people to ask for support, as well as messages to be inspired.
Ms. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I do every day," she said.
A 45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lidne, told me that her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
"Everybody knew him for smiling.
They always said that this smile made any room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother’s body after he had committed suicide.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid it'll have consequences."
Miss Davis created cards "so people know that there are those they can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't lock yourself in, you have to talk."
Ms. Humphries, who had been a friend of Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say he was feeling depressed, depressed or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that it had changed."
And on Christmas Day, he was totally discouraged, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
She told me that his death had become a huge trauma to them, but they must survive it.
I'm supposed to go to the family.
But we have to keep living and fight."

Bretta Cavanaugh's future hangs on his hair: the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could get what we asked - limited time and the nature of the investigation - we might have reached some agreement," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was "disintegrated" against the backdrop of the irrevocable loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has to do with time.
The mid-elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6, and if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will make it very difficult for them to make their own choices to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush's rule, and by which means he met his wife, Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
The Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 democracies, will vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the problem with the same number of votes and to approve him as a Supreme Court judge.
During Kim's reign, the number of North Korean fugitives was reduced.
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean exiles dropped to South Korea, a South Korean legislator stated.
Pak Pion Seug, referring to data from the Republic of South Korea Department of United Republics, stated that in the past year there were 1,127 fugitives compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were the increased border control between North Korea and China and the fact that illegal smugglers now demand more money for this.
In Pygnus they refrained from public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans are eventually offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul stated that more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMM) between the two Koreas.
China views fugitives as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally at war, has improved markedly in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyenne and discussed the issue of denuclearization, which had been stalled.
This happened after June’s historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Ying in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate on nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yoong-Ho, in the background of the accepted sanctions, accused the U.S. of failing to make progress ever since.
"With no confidence in the US, we can't be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can't be any one-sided disarmament," said Ri Jon-ho in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Cavanano "territorial" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the position of Supreme Court Judge Bretta Cavanaugh a "territorial" and stated that he was not in a position to work for the Supreme Court at a time.
Pelosi gave her opinion in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Festivals in Austen, Texas.
"I was always thinking that if a woman had ever acted in this way, she would have been called "hissterical," – Pelosi commented on her reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Covano emotionally denied the charges of sexual abuse over Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Cavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he would almost scream and yell at his family and school years.
He also publicly condemned the democracies on the committee, calling the charges against him "absord and coordinated by the destruction of his reputation," organized by liberals, who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
According to Pelosí, Cavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice against the democracies.
"I think that these applications, as well as his anti-Clinton and the democracies, he will take his own stand," she said.
Pelosí was indignant when she was asked if she would try to declare Cavanao impeachment, if his guilt was confirmed, and if she would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not worth working not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he's working now," said Pelosí.
Cavanaugh is currently serving as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in Columbia County.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions against the law on affordable medical care or the case of Row vs. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing in Cavanaugh’s office, the question was whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"Now is not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, biased person and we will say how wonderful it is," said Pelosi.
Women should possess this weapon.
These were just words that contained months and years of rage, and she could not express them without tears.
"We cry when we get angry," Miss Steine told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She said, "One woman who worked somewhere as executive director and helped me very much said that she was crying when she got angry, but she had her own method, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the householder, "You might think I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
And I am angry."
And after that, she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are considered an acceptable solution to anger, partly because they are perceived differently.
One of my most vivid memories of my first job in an office where men were most likely to work was when I once cried with unspoken anger, and the older woman, an inhospitable manager, who I had always been a little afraid of, grabbed me by the collar and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught on board a boat called Monkey Business, after which he emerged from the race, Ms. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said to me with laughter after 30 years.
"There have already been seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate is the last one they needed."
Someone called the situation "The White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was behind in the congregation, and she promised not to take part in the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret their support of the men of $1,000, gave her only $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave the talk and announced that she wouldn't run a formal campaign, she was emotional -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system, which made it very difficult to raise money and forced the voters to look at the voters as well as the members of the Chamber of Deputies, and anger for sexism, and she was willing to cry.
"You'd think I'd have a nervous breakdown," recalls Miss Schroeder's reaction to the press.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
"She's crying?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S. - China trade war were desperate, and while it is far from over, in the long run, the divide between countries can benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots early this year, taxing basic Chinese exports, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminium.
The biggest problem this week is that new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (U.S.) are taxing half of all goods coming into the United States from China.
Beijing was paying back the same coin every time, with a tax of between five and ten percent on American products worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to doing the same thing, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to miss out on this promise in the near future.
To force Washington to retreat means to accept the demands, but for China's president, S. Jinping, the U.S. public worship is too shameful.
But experts say that if Beijing takes advantage of the situation correctly, the pressure in the U.S. trade war could bring China a long-term advantage, reducing the relationship between two economies.
"A rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic collapse in any country, and this is indeed a greater threat than observers have recognized before," said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asian-related issues at the Center for New America Security analytical center.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was "ready" to return refugees
In Syria, refugees are said to be willing to return voluntarily and to seek help in rebuilding a war - torn country that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Walid Al-Mualem said that conditions were improving in the country.
"The reality today has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore terrorist - destroyed areas so that people can return to normal life.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism have now been created, as have unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and limited their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild a war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that supported the riot.
Europe anchors the victory on Reider's Cub in Paris.
The European team won Kubok Ryder in 2018 when the U.S. team won with a total score of 16.5:10.5 on Le Gold National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated six times in Europe and has not won the Kubok Ryder tournament since 1993.
Europe returned to the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team gained the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Miquelson, who did his best to try most of the tournament, hit his first long-range strike on the 16th Hole of steam-3 in the water and gave up Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds and became one of the four players who've ever been through 5-0-0 since the beginning of the modern-day tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated by a top-down player in the European Turbyern Olesen team in Denmark.
Dastin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world rating, gave up the score of 2:1 Jan Poulter from England, who may have been taking part in the "Kubok Ryder" tournament for the last time.
Sergio Garcia, a Spanish veteran, who had already participated in the tournament eight times, became a European who won the most in the tournaments all the time, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"Of course I don't cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's team merit, and I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia after winning Europe.
He passes the estaphet to his fellow countryman, John Rem, who defeated the American legend of golf Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single game of score 2:1.
"I feel tremendous pride in winning Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said Ram, 23-year-old.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a career record in the Kubok Ryder tournament 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who won the 14 Major tournaments, giving up only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. Congregation tried to reach the Perway area all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finnau, who showed high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furick said about his team after a grudging performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we soon dominated Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the U.S. Golf Association and the Kubok Ryder Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
They are to be commended.
We lost."
Current information on the red tide: decrease in concentrations in the districts of Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota
A recent report by the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife reveals a general decline in the level of red - color microorganisms in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife, the high - blossoming conditions reported in certain districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarastos, Charlotte, and Collier indicate a decrease in concentration.
