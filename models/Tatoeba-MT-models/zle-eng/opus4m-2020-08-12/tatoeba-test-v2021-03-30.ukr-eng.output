Tom's smart.
He's annoying.
If you go, I'll miss you.
Point out the wise one's mistake, and he will thank you, and point the fool to the mistake, and he will hurt you.
That's a great idea.
I don't think there's anything out there.
Make your point clear.
They don't know us.

This story made me think.
Careful with your head!
I'll miss you.
Take this.

You want me to bring you a glass of water?
Tom told me he thought Mary was ugly.
She smiled at me.
You know they're actresses.
I don't think you're heartless.
It's been built for ages.

Why did Tom kill Mary?
Tom said it wasn't.
Let's put a stop to this futile discussion.
Tom cleaned the apple.
Tom didn't read the report you wrote.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
No one would help me do that.
You're Italian.
What is she like?
A pocket thief took a passport from Mark.
I think you like him.
This magazine costs only two pounds, including delivery.
I'll miss you.
I sat on the bench next to Tom.
They love each other.
Come tomorrow.
What kind of insects did you eat?
I saw Tom hit the car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do this.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees it.
I got on the wrong bus.
I turned down the offer.
Mary had already done what she had to do.
I watched Tom.
Have you reserved a table?
Where's the money?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about going to a picnic.
We couldn't buy tickets for a concert until we got the money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary in.
Tom doesn't play tennis very well.
I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
That's why you're here.
We ran out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People living in a place cannot enjoy life in a village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a Christmas book.
I want cheeseburger, cola and fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly accepted.
I think Tom's wrong.
Are you okay?
Perhaps you're the only one who can do that.
Who doesn't have a radio?
Your singing makes professional singers scarlet out of shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom's drooping.
It was big.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary who did it.
Esther is a lesbian Jew.
I was bit by a dog last week.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I don't fear Mary.
Try to swim!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It is unlikely that Tom will forget how this is done.
Drinking?
Tom's gonna do this with you?
Are you awake?
The meeting started at five o'clock.
Mary said she liked doing it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I was only in Tokyo once.
I got a bill for electricity.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be okay.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do this.
All members must be present.
Don't you feel comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who do you plan to do this with?
We're happy with the solution.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is this Mary's husband?
He'll find out.
The Witness who saw things for himself is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.
Tom's back at the hotel.

Tom's done.
When I went into the room, she played the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They did not lose hope.
Tom threw an egg into Mary's.
When do you expect to be here?
Tom was working his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party's going?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Okay, I'll bite.
I don't want any more.
Do you know how much she likes colors?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, I'd love to!
She started playing the old song.
Why Do They Speak French?
That's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
It's spring soon.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning on staying long?
When are you planning on going to Japan?
My kids are in school.
I put up my suitcase.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking about you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant bucket.
Get the salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom's younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom's very open.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane took off at 9:00 a.m.
Tom speaks French quite fluently.
John caught the tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom wiped himself dry with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I've got a lot of time.
Allow yourself to be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
The following month Tom is leaving Boston.
It's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Each year millions of people die of hunger.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
A wrong address was on the letter.
That's the last train.
Who's gonna fight?

They had moved to another religion.
I need to be careful.
I jumped them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever gonna do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I'm just a haircut.
Mary said that she had never studied French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
It's our fault.
You're so cute.
It's going to cost about $15.
I banged the door.
His theory is noteworthy.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The pillow's very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.
So Tom became famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You sang.
I did everything perfectly.
I love writing.
Kyoto is an outstandingly beautiful city.
The following month I turn sixteen.
You think there's a chance that this will happen?

When will your final lesson end?
I came to say goodbye, Tom.
I like that dog.
I tried to contact her.
What's she got?
How's the exam?
Where was the book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary do it.
We should help Tom.
It rained all day long.
I was upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines during the day, and the moon shines at night.
I got on it.
You were right before.
I hope Tom will help us.
You have the right to be happy.

You deserve some rest.
These are fresh ones.

Listen to his frank opinion.
Aren't you on duty to-night?
Tom never had to learn a lot.
How's your wife doing, Tom?

I could never have done that without your help.
For breakfast I always have coffee and greens.
I'm hungry because I haven't had breakfast.
I'm the best.

He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're losing.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Tell me.
The surface of the balloon is not euclide, so the rules of euclide geometry do not apply to it.

We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read that story in a book.
Tom still has a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do this.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in Oslo in 1997.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the Internet.
You're charming.

What happened to her?

Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom's gonna do it right away.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book has become a subject of criticism.
That's going to be brilliant.
I'm scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm under the fly.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom witnessed in Mary's case.
I thought you were gone.

You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play violin?
Will you give me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.

You can go wherever you want.
I'll see Tom later.

Tom's calling you.
So you have to tell him to do it.
He speaks on the esperanto with a little French accent.

Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't do that.
She has good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me that he did not like to speak French.

When Tom was younger, he was a ladies' curator.
I'll take care of it.
Did you find any mistakes?

Tom started to puke.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.

I have some memory problems.
Where's Mom?
He fainted three hours after the accident.
You speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.

I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know the reason?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom is a little behind schedule.

I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to speak so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You're never lying.
Wait a minute, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It'll work, you'll see.
She gave it up.
Tom's safe.
I finally got my driver's license.
I'm not a student.
That was why Mary was sorry.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom's checking the phone all the time.
How's the wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone but me is late.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan on shaking the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with my client.
I'm disappointed with your effectiveness.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you teaching?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Good morning.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom's going to the party tonight.
I told you.
She was on her way to the airport.
She studies Portuguese in Brazil.
What do you say to them?
How did you know this would happen?
What is it?
If natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, esperanto may be compared to a plastic tree that was artificially created.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's gonna be in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said what exactly happened?
I finally realized that I wasn't in love with you.
You told 'cause I was kidding?
That's why I was terribly bored.
Tom said I was pretty.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
Today I have a lot to do.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
What do you understand?
They suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take out the garbage.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston map?
Your sister's always great.
It's going to be very hard to do.
The child was paralyzed with fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him, you should consider his youth.
We're sure this wasn't an accident.

He knows I love him.

I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
They're worthless now.
Did you try to talk to them?
It was much harder to do so than it seemed.
Her friends made fun of her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom could win.

Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
You're going on a train?
Tom said Mary was pretty.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, aren't they?
Is that why Boston still likes it?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad and never returned.
Gather your toys together.
It was much harder to do so than it seemed.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
So it's interesting.
Have you finished your job yet?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not hard to do.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but I'm taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I've never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was too heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said he thought Mary would not.
You missed something.
I immediately called Tom.
You looked interested.
It'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We really don't have a choice.
I'm dead.

We're not a couple.
You want to see a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm starting to get hot.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Tom really thinks somebody's listening?
There's no need for a roll!
Tom, you might say it's beautiful.
Anyway, I disagree with you.
I should have left earlier.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like it?
The problem is, solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's hangover.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
You understand?
Tom wasn't mean to me.
How do I say thank you in Japanese?

I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's free.
I am very interested in studying French.
Be nice to the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your job.
You're working next door?
You admit it, don't you?
I have business tomorrow.
I'm sloppy.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Oklahoma, but I grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding.
I'm sharing everything.
The choices are obvious.
The only person Tom talks about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom is okay.
I'm not sleeping well.
Don't you buy that?
The women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did that?
Did you do it?
I'm having trouble sleeping at night.
Tom sometimes annoys me.
I'm pretty good at dancing.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.

It's raining, so we can't do this.
It was extremely surreal.

Get out of here!
What's your name?
Tom and Mary plan to retire when they're sixty-five years old.
Can I use your phone?
Your sufferings make me happy.
When did you do something for me?
We closed the door.
There he is!
We're different.
Tom and Mary know?
Are you okay?
Don't sleep with the light on.
He's not stupider than you.
The trains in Serbia are extremely slow.
I think Tom is wrong.
