In my view, the literature programme was shaped by women of Balzakov age on the basis of their interests.
From 19th - century Russian literature, we preferred Daniel and Volkonsky.
They were writing Bellesics, of course, from the point of view of the same Balzakom ladies.
And the psychology and suffering of Tolstoy and Turgene's heroin are not so interesting to teenagers.

Matt Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Microcate Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has a different rigidity of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by a latex coconut fibre and natural latex, moderately soft - a plate of natural latex.
A spring block of 1,000 springs per square metre is quickly adapted to the sleeping body to prevent the appearance of a "voluntary" or "gamac" effect.
Inhaling materials should be identified as part of the model ' s merits.
Lutex, perforated for air permeability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, as is the coconut carpet.
As a result, a healthy microclimate remains in the bedroom.
The mattress is also subject to an extended guarantee period.
The official guarantee from the manufacturer is five years old, and actually the mattress is longer.
The protection against dust and pollution is assigned to a de-conquerable sakcard chawl supplied in a set.

Germany: Fourth inoculation from the coronary is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany would not be final, but would continue with renewed force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of coronary vaccine are likely to be sufficient for full protection.
This is the case with Ulrich Weigerdt, head of the Association of Physicians of General Practice.
This is what Die Welt reports on Saturday, 11 December.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn”, the expert believes.
In addition, Weigoldt hopes that the fourth vaccine from the coronary may be “combined with the vaccine from the flu”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help combat the spread of the new strain of the Omicron coronary.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
For example, Omicron is three times more likely to be recontaminated than Delta or Beta strains.
The results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa show this.
Therefore, Biontech / Pfier producers plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
Companies stress that the two doses of vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new version of the Omicron coroner.
A study by Biontech and Pfier found that at two doses of the vaccine, efficiency was significantly lower: “neutralization capacity is reduced by more than 25 times”.
“This indicates that two BNT162b2 doses do not provide sufficient protection against exposure to omicron stam”, stressed Biotech and Pfier.
A third dose is therefore required.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, President of the German Society for Icommunicable Diseases, is in favour of reducing the interval between second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Alzheimer's, accelerated vaccination will affect both the delta virus and the coronary omicronate.
"The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly," the expert said.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pottoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) is different from many other fans in that it was originally designed to be used for ice fishing, not just for dumping.
These species have more than the sized analogies, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another feature to be recognized is the upper fin of solid and compact plastics, which creates additional vibration shades with vertical and horizontal wires.
As a winter vib, it's a fairly aggressive game to catch in the Bet-A-Vib vat.
Often the most catchy is simple monotonous animation, that is, moving up and down with almost no pause.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient for fishing in a limited space, covered by underwater vegetation, carcasses and other obstacles for which the lead is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant for the winter fishing of a ship and a large perch, especially in midwinter, when accurate and aggressive baiting is required.
After reaching the end of the track, Bet-A-Vib is immediately turned and returned to the reference vertical.
At the same time, Bet-A-Vib is used for winter trout fishing.
To suit the caprice, you can choose from two modifications: NS - NanoSund or SL - Silent.
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib has the potential to inflame a passive rat that does not even react to the animal.
Bet-A-Vib shows range and accuracy when fishing.
This vulture is understood and is not capricious and is well combined with the lion and weaving cords of even large diameters.
To be caught, either a rat, a ship, a ersha or a perch, other than a straight one, is also a "foot" sometimes with a "trick" on the bottom.
If you're caught in locked places, you can change the front triangle to a double, which will reduce the probability of hits.
Among the baits of its Bet-A-Vib class is one of the most sustainable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
Both relatively small and relatively deep sites can be used with the same success.
All models are equipped with the OWner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries were reported
Libya has more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMSC) Wagner.
This was stated on Sunday, 12 December, by the President of the Supreme Council of State of the Republic, Khaled Al-Mishiri.
“There are currently more than 7,000 Vagner mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet planes at the airbases of Gardabia (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)” and he is quoted by Andolu.
Khaled Al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries were “in an attempt to seize” the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean, after “inculcating their human beings” in the Central African Republic.
Keep Presence
According to the interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and was “located in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and a port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, as noted in the Agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that Wagner's PMSC has the support of the Kremlin.
Where else could mercenaries be?
According to the agency, Wagner is believed to operate in nine countries in Africa - the Central African, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiary enterprises receive certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of arms, technology and military services to those countries,” the article states.
According to the media, “vagners” allegedly fought in Donbassa, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the KAR.
This group is not part of the force or the police register, and its members are absent from the uniforms of personnel.
This company is under United States sanctions.
We will recall earlier that 27 EU countries had approved reprisals against Wagner.
It is expected that this decision will be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Libyan High Council of State de facto is the second House of Parliament, with advisory functions with its dominant Islamists, and writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single voting day for the election of members of Parliament and Heads of State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
"The elections are less than two weeks away, and the chances that they will pass in time are rapidly declining," the material notes.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates and broadcasts Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy with Russian eyes
Thirty-eight per cent of Russians see more success in foreign policy than failures, 29 per cent feel that failures prevail.
"Traditions of success - "in Syria, protected, restored the world there," "North Flow 2 Decision," "the whole world was intimidated by the cool weapons," "Cream we've recovered."
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “peace isolation”, says the Foundation's Public Opinion study.
The Dubai Government has completely abandoned paper processing - all government services have also become digital.
The Government of Dubai reported a complete phase-out of paper processing and the conversion to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively electronically.
This is reported by the Emirates ' s WAM News Agency.
"This day marked the beginning of a new phase of digitization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," stated Saturday's Crown Prince Emirata, President of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan Ben Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktum.
The internal and external flow of documentation to all institutions in Dubai will now be done only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health, CWC, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc., many commercial entities have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to an electronic government and the digitalization of documentation began in Dubai from 2018 onwards.
During this period, the authorities estimated that 336 million paper sheets had been saved, representing 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in monetary equivalents.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobin, had previously stated that electronic services would save citizens two days a year.

Turkey ' s vehicle production and export fell below 2020
The production and export of Turkish cars declined sharply in November, amid the depreciation of lira.
As a result, 11 months of industry performance was worse than last year ' s output, reports Bloomberg, referring to data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 vehicles were released in Turkey in November, 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
About 75,000 vehicles were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's.
And while Turkey ' s road sector had shown positive momentum by the previous year as a result of the first 10 months of this year, in the 11 months of 2021 it had already produced 0.3 per cent less than last year ' s output.
The fall was caused by a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which cost 29 per cent of the dollar in November.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 IAS entities were deferred on credit payments in 2021
The First Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, describes the situation of small and medium-sized business benefits and transmits the IIA “Casinform” correspondent.
“As reported by the Agency for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, pursuant to the request of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, an Order No. 127 of the Chairman of the Agency of 9 April 2021 on the approval of the procedure for granting deferred payments for loans from small and medium-sized business entities was adopted,” Alihan Smail wrote in his response to the deputy request.
He recalled that the arrangements for the postponement of loan payments included the granting of deferred loans by banks and entities engaged in microfinance activities to IAS entities, including IP, prior to 1 April 2021, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The delay was 30 to 90 days at the choice of the IAS entity.
The borrower ' s statement may have indicated a different time-limit for the deferred payment.
During the delay on the borrower, the claim and claim work, the notice of payment of outstanding arrears, and the charge of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended” - noted the premier.
In 2021, second-level banks were requested to defer payments for loans from 603 ISA borrowers, of which 553 IAS entities valued at 9.7 billion tenge were deferred.
In IFIs, 131 IAS entities submitted applications for postponement, of which 95 entities worth 105.8 million tenge were granted deferment,” concluded A. Smaillov.
Pulmonologist Purasev suggested that people with weak immunity could easily carry the strain of "Ocmirone"
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity could carry it more easily than those with strong body defenses.
Pulmonologist Sergei Purassev explained why the strain of the coroner's Ocmiron might be dangerous.
The reason to look for is when the virus is born.
Scientists believe that Ocmirone was born into the body of HIV-positive or immunodeficiency virus-infected.
I mean, he didn't find any resistance to immunity at the Mutation.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no answer to immunity, it became very rapid.
Apparently, he's got these spicy proteins, the spikes, maybe more than they should be, their antibodies were not cut during the mutations, and he's a pulmonologist, Sergei Purasev.
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity might be more able to carry the Ocmiron than those with a strong body defense reaction.
It turns out that the body's strong response to something, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens in pneumococopic infections, when young people die 30 years old, and the 60-year-olds carry it in the form of a Czech.
The young man's immune response is totally inadequate: where he could only use his finger, he beats like a gun on his sparrows, and concluded Sergey Purasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coroner had dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them was pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to buy only the symptoms -- all the hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of the body's intoxication -- temperature, weakness, failure.
Then comes respiratory symptoms: difficult breathing, throating, coughing.
Pain on the right or on the left, abdominal pain may also indicate a growing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, a growing generation between 12 and 18 years of age may begin to vaccinated before the end of the year.
The virologist Paul Volchkov, director of the FIFI gene engineering laboratory, noted that this category is very heavily affected by the cow.
Adolescents who go to school have as many contacts as possible.
It's the most active wire, like kindergarten teachers, says "Moscow 24", Paul Volczkov, a virologist, head of the FFI gene engineering laboratory.

Immunologists have come up with a hypothesis of why obese people are victims of sheep
The authors examined the fat tissue left behind by bariatric operations and found that fat cells known as adipocyts could be infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells in the fat tissue, the macrophages, were also infected and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists have also studied the fat tissue of patients who died of sheep, and have discovered parts of the coronary in fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid responding to the immune system.
It's probably also possible for SAS-CoV-2.
A biologist described the causes of dementia
The candidate for biological sciences, Simeon Goloshikin, described the causes of the dementia and the ways in which it was prevented from being interviewed by radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from the disease.
The syndrome is shown to be a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, the person is difficult to navigate even in a familiar environment.
Holoshikin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurogenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, the role of such factors as social exclusion and the absence of active cognitive activity was possible,” he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and low - speed lifestyles.
Among the early signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, the inability to concentrate and the reduction of abstract thinking.
“There is discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor”, the biologist added.
In order to prevent the outbreak of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical loading and training in cognitive skills and skills that require the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt returned some 30,000 illegal artefacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return to its homeland some 30,000 artefacts that have been smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has recovered 29,300 artefacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C.,” he said.
Abdel Gauad specified that all artifacts exported by smuggling were recorded in the archives.
Department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, professionals “track auctions around the world and Internet sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that upon return, cultural values were restored and then exhibited in museums.
He said that one of the returned artifacts was the ancient skeleton of a man found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities requested Interpol to help them find Pharaoh Tutanhamon's bustet sold at an auction in London.
The Christie's auction house held a tender on 4 July at which a bus over 3,000 years of age was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million roubles).
Egypt was not satisfied with this.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed from the Karnak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanhamon, depicted as the god of the sun of Amon, has been kept in a private collection and has not been tendered since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has in recent years actively sought to repatriate illicitly exported monuments of antiquity.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research into “black digters”.
“The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account” - and this is correct, since Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an autonomous people (near the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people - so many Tatars (Kasan) live in Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of that people is two words!
Only the Turkic language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile staff
Creedit Suisse requires her staff to provide access to their personal mobile devices to the bank, writes Financial Times.
In Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communications devices, instead offering a discount for the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications partner.
Under the current rules, the bank can look at information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to deal with business matters with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to verify mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if the staff member has used them to meet a client who has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved away, the bank wishes to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to address business issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank had set a deadline within which staff could read the new rule.
There is no official comment on the new requirement in Credit Suisse.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Esenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult life for a poet and his "ego".
He's already outside of any literary association, and he's dissipating his identity, and he's on his own, but he's famous, he's wanted, sometimes he's a hard-knocked critic, even viciously, but the public reading is ready to carry him on his hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them real masterpieces, the "Prime Motivation" cycle, the "Anna Snowina" poem, and eight books, the "The Soviet Hands".
And the main success is that at the end of June of the 25th year, the State Member entered into a contract with Esenin to publish his writings in volume 3.
None of the present-day Sergey Alexandrovich poets have received such honor, he's the first one!
In addition, this resulted in very good money - a contract fee of 1,000 roubles per month for 20 months (the factory manager, for example, received 300 roubles per month and the engineer received 200 roubles).
The money that year was needed more than ever.
Esenin married Lvo Tolstoy's grandson, Tolstoy's sister-in-law, and his mother.
It's like life's getting better, there's something to be enjoyed, but it's mostly painted in a dark tone, like a nightmare from the Black Man poem (written in November 1925 and published after Esen's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where the pain came from.
Whether the wind whistles
Over an empty and desolate field,
I'm the one growing up in September,
It's getting drunk.
Many people have noted that Esenin has given up heavily, that he looks ill, and that he is obviously ill.
There's more and more bouts, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just in alcoholism...
However, if this diagnosis of alcoholism - Sergey Alexandrovich was treated by someone else - there were no valid documents left.
Let's say that in May 1923, when Esenin, at the urging of his fourth wife, was given health care at the Paris clinic by Aysedor Duncan, Professor Petra Hannuskin, who would be back in Moscow two years later.
And here's the evidence of poet's poet's poets, of this kind of scandal, of the police forces getting enough -- scattered by dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the '20s, a terrible affair of a poet with a green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Essen settled briefly with a friend named Ivan Startsov.
Amazingly, Esenin never had his own home in Moscow or in Peter, with very good incomes, to live in flats, hotels, or acquaintances.
The elders remember:
"He only came to sleep at night, and in most cases he was in an inadvertent, intoxicated state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Esenin fell on the stairs...
Falling down, his face scratched, and the wheezes.
When he got a little in his head, he started coughing constantly, spraying all the simple blood...
Yes, Esenin himself, after fighting for Europe and the United States (there was a dry law in the United States at the time, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except the Kabaks and the streets...
I'm at the end, and people stop remembering...
Well, I was drinking, of course...
And I was drinking 'cause I've been pounding."

Matras Promtex-Ott Duet LatexEconom 100x195
Promtex-Ott Duet Latex Economy is a modern budget model in the line of the prize class.
The base of the mattress is a block of independent double springs of Duet.
A more flexible small spring is inserted inside the large spring.
This allows the weight to be evenly distributed to the mattress.
On both sides, the mattress is filled with artificial latex.
It's like a natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and viscosity of this material enhances the smoothness of the mattress.
Artificial hexallergen latex, it doesn't absorb moisture and dust.
The matras will be excellent for a couple with a large weight difference (of 30 kilograms).
Because of smart spring, there's no wave effect here when the light partner rolls on the side of the heavy.
A nice, soft, groovy chawl from a practical sakcard by Sense will make a layer of syntepon.
Natural tissue does not accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to make this model of the mattress in a straight-track (vacuum-roll-packing) model.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland considers that Belarus uses migrants as “a weapon” against the EU
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland considers that Belarus uses migrants as “a weapon”
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Paul Jablonski, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intended to return to such “operation” next year.
A statement was made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Jablonski, sanctions against Belarus were temporarily “stopped by Lukashenko”, but he is “in the process of actively seeking new ways”.
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
According to kp.ru, the European Union had previously launched the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It concerned 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, there was a willingness to further expand restrictive measures against the Republic, “unless the situation in the country improves”.
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not the Blue cap": When a bad jacket makes a man laugh
The 2021 Secular events were dominated by barracks jackets.
Perhaps Daniel Craig was the first to make his new fashionable decision.
As early as September, he appeared in the premier film "It's No Time to Die" in a barchat raspberry jacket and a traditional "Bondo" grandmother.
The example was followed twice by Prince William, who first presented a green brown jacket at the award ceremony of the Earthshot Print, and then chose a more classic version of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend worked out for himself and Lionel Messsia.
The football player came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in Dolce & Gabbana's barracks jacket.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same clothes.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for the sandy men's jackets in Russia.
According to service analysts at Haseta.Ru, they were purchased 1.4 times more frequently.
The most popular are the warm sand jackets with a lined and covered silhouettes, the main colors being dark and run-in, whooping, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between roubles of between 3,000 and 6,000, and men prefer to buy exclusively jackets, and they choose the suits less frequently.
You can buy them from more than just online reylers.
The budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Sara.
In this season, there are almost all brands of the lux pajakis -- and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Guci model, which produced one of the premier films "Hom Guci", the ambassador of the brand Jared Leto.
By choosing expensive stamps, you can be sure the barracks are made of silk.
The special interlacing technology is used to produce dense tissue with waxy outer texture and smooth inside.
More budgetary options are made from cotton or polyamide, but are therefore less useful.
The fashion expert, Lamoda Ilya Wahoskin, warns that in the case of a sand jacket, the main thing is not his model or fascism, but his relevance.
"Barhat requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you're gathered for a party or a solemn event," explains Vahoškin. "He'll also be appropriate if the invitation includes "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion to be met is the buyer ' s status, which allows the choice to be made in favour of a barracks jacket.
"A man in a sandshoe jacket, first of all, has to make the right forward-looking party of wealth," they say, "Telegram canals say about the male fashion of "Beauty Brammel." - The owners of the barracks tend to belong to the castes of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to side-events of the world, where there is always a Dress Code.
Ilya Wahoskin proposes to combine a jacket from a barhata with similar dresses: classic trousers with arrows, single-tone shirts, silk tiers, lollusks with a bone, and wrists.
Too simple and day-to-day things will look inappropriate.
The fashion experts at Brammel are confident that it will not be appropriate to have a private employee in the corporation's barracks jacket, but if it is "the guide of those who run this event, "yes," he's the subject of that."
If the employee is downgraded and the aim is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to get out of the financial bonus, it is better not to put on a barracks jacket.
Management will definitely appreciate the phrase "not on Senka hat" -- the editors of Telegram canal say about male fashion.
Very mixed feelings of voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, it's so painful.
And it's not associated at all with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But I want good luck with all my heart.
It's all about money -- alternative energy is well lobbyed, that is, paid.
Billion-dollar investment.
Do they grieve?
No, the price of electricity went up.
Traditional energy is also not in the overlay -- gas, oil, and coal were cheaper than they are now selling.
The demand for fuel is wild.
A penny drops.
Who's on the way?
As usual, a private buyer.
Do Indian problems touch the sheriff?
Hence, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who “suck” the energy crisis.
They did their job.
That's a good leg.
I didn't see any beautiful person on the pictures in the article.
Just straight through the average passenger.
Perhaps if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it to the entire wagon, they will not be able to do so.
But it's only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "pretty" people, but certainly not because of their appearance.

The immunologist stated that re-accupation in four to five months would help protect against the strain of the coroner ' s " mecron " .
Reaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronaviral infection "mecron".
This was a statement made by the immunologist Nicholas Kruchkov, who called immunization six months later, given the emergence of a new strain, "a very large period."
"It was normal for the former strains, but now it is best to do the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four months," said the expert, calling in parallel with the vaccination campaign to re-reoccupate.
Kruchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good number of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person was given two inoculations and Busters, or was ill and vaccinated, or was vaccinated and cured, he was given a `hydrid immunity', i.e. an antitel of many and neutralizing enough,” the expert clarified.
The Group of Seven warned Russia of “scale consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom) issued a statement following the meeting of heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia's “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have enormous consequences and will be costly” in Moscow, but the specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union are united in our condemnation of the expansion of Russia's military power and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine,” states the statement.
The Ministers further call on Russia “to reduce escalation, to use diplomatic channels and to abide by its international obligations with regard to transparency of military activities”, which President Baiden of the United States spoke of during the video call to President Putin on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Norman format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of Seven also state.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in return”, they caution.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine ' s reserved position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” also stated the statement.
Earlier in the day, Elizabeth Trass, head of British diplomacy, stated that Russia would be “seriously affected” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
She said that the meeting showed “a single voice from the Group of Seven countries, accounting for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have enormous consequences for Russia”.
Pfier vaccine considered 32 times less effective than omicron stamma
The effectiveness of the Pfiere-Biontech vaccine against the omicron stamma of the coronary is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong, which transmits the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
Vaccines were considered less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity among citizens who had received two doses of COVID-19.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the Sarah-CoV-2 baseline, but this ability was significantly reduced against omicronism,” said Professor Malik Peyris.
In doing so, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the heavy current of the disease when it is infected with the coronavirus.
Previously, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the development of the coronary pandemic, given its impact on Omicron Stamma.
The authors of the study concluded that omicron Stamm could generate a new wave of virus circulation and increase mortality unless additional measures were taken.
The head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine accused the FAR of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of former FAR Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition by Kiev of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of anti-Osniper systems and rifles to hit the drones.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened his position on rifles by recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with the allies.
These include the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
In the meantime, FT notes that the position of the new German Government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholtz, on the authorization of arms to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany, Andrei Melnick, expressed the view that Kiev was not worth waiting for Berlin to supply arms to Chancellor Scholze.
He said that the previous FAR leadership had explained its refusal to provide arms at the risk of a military escalation of the conflict in Donbassa, despite Russia's “occupation of Russia” of parts of Ukrainian territory.
The same “illogical” position, I'm sure the diplomat, Germany will retain with the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski stated that Kiev was expecting assistance from Berlin to equip the Navy.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany will “be Ukraine's technical partner”, the President added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the Co-Chair of the FARG Green Party, Robert Habek, visited the Republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

The German team "Mersedes" whose pilot Lewis Hamilton on the Grand Primacy of Aboud Dhabi finished the second follow-up to the Red Bull racer Max Ferstampen, protested the outcome of the race, reports the "Formula 1" press service.
Mercedes considers that the “Formula-1” rules were violated during the visit 48.12 and 48.8.
In the first case, the German team contests the decision of the judges to return roundabouts to the leaders.
According to the second one, Ferstapin was in advance of Hamilton to the authorized “artament” zone.
Add that the result of the Grand Prih Abu Dhabi, according to which Verstapin outran Hamilton for 2,256 seconds and won the "Formula 1" World Cup, is preliminary when Mercedes' protests are considered.
G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the G7 countries have warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continues military aggression against Ukraine, as indicated in the final statement of the parties.
The meeting also noted that it condemned the strengthening of Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
“Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs”, states a statement published on the British Government's website.
The Ministers of the G7 countries and the EU High Representative noted that “the Russian armed violence and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine are united in their condemnation”.
The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Elizabeth Trass, at a press conference in Liverpool, warned of “great consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to renounce aggression against Ukraine,” she said.
Earlier at the Liverpool summit, Foreign Ministers G7 agreed that, in order to resolve the crisis, Russian troops on the border with Ukraine needed to return to the negotiating table.
It was about negotiations in "the Norman format".
The North Atlantic Alliance has also advocated dialogue on Ukraine in “the Norman format”.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Maria Zaharova, stated that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries had “sentenced in their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes”.

Ways of returning stolen money via the Internet cash store were opened up
There are several ways to recover the money stolen through the Internet and not to become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were discovered by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
For example, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when bank card data are placed in the hands of abusers, it is recommended that major funds be stored on a map or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Some savings can be set aside in a savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend a separate map for online purchases.
If the money was stolen from stores that did not use 3D Secure, the return process could be initiated.
“In accordance with the rules established by payment systems, unauthorized transactions without the use of 3D Security are the responsibility of the participant in the settlement chain who does not use the service”, specified the representative of the Trades and Services Bank.
The expert from the international payment provider, Ecompay, Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer had the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraud transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used a map on online resources that did not require two-factor authorizations, the transaction could be challenged and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases Internet producers themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent to the delivery.
On 19 November, Ekaterin Mizulina, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Security Internet League, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud were received, ranging from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
She said that an effective solution in the current circumstances could be to create a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss “North Flow 2” and EU legislation
The newly elected German chancellor, Olaf Scholtz, arrived in Warsaw to negotiate the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops outside Ukraine's borders and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline North.
Although Scholtz has expressed his desire to maintain a good relationship between Germany and Poland for years, the leaders of the two countries have expressed unequivocal expectations of each other.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz Moravecki, stated that he would encourage Scholtz to oppose “North Flow II”, which was intended to transport Russian gas to Germany, bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravecki, Russia can use gas pipelines against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, for its part, supported Poland ' s efforts to stop the flow of migrants attempting to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that he would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party “Right and Justice” violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay a fine and its highest court held that national legislation took precedence over EU regulations.
The new Government of Germany, which is sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not undertaken a public commitment to halt the work of the “North Flow 2” in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told Congress members that they had reached an understanding with Germany to stop the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, reporting on Tuesday to a high-level official of the United States Congress.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholtz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by the representatives of the Greater Seven.

The Ministry wants to give writers residences.
The State will hand over federal property inherited from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Soviet Literary Fund to the future Russian Literary Support Fund.
It will be used to establish a written residence and to inform the Parliament's Gazette in the Ministry, which will become the founder of the fund.
The Ministry is preparing a draft presidential decree establishing the Russian Letteraries Support Fund.
The Explanatory Note states that the Fund will be entrusted with the task of, inter alia, targeting and maintaining buildings and buildings once owned by the Soviet Union of writers and Littfund.
“The Russian Federation has transferred a significant number of real estate properties previously owned by the Soviet Union Literary Fund, including those located in the town of Pereblino, the village of Komarvo of Leningrad and others”, reported the “Parliament Gazette” in the Ministry's Press Service.
The draft decree requires that it be reflected in the statute of the Fund that it is “constituted to facilitate literary activities by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of Letteraries”.
“To create conditions for creative activity” means to create, on the basis of the transferred property in different regions of Russia, writing residences with comfortable conditions for creativity”, explained in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to our publication.

The plumbing in the church wall will pay $20,000
A plumber who found money in a church wall in Texas State in the United States will be awarded a reward.
This is reported in a press release by the non-profit Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in the large evangelical church of Lakewood, where pastor Joel Ossetia preachs, promising that devout Christians would be blessed with wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, Justin Coley, a plumber, repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of cash and cheques under thermal insulation.
He handed over the find of the church and said that he did not receive even gratitude from Austen.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do," quotes KPRC-TV.
Apparently, the find relates to a theft that took place in Lakewood Church seven years ago.
At that time, about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques were kept in a church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any loss.
However, for information on the perpetrators, a $25,000 reward was awarded.
Justin Caughley could not claim this amount because the award had expired.
Despite this, a non-profit organization called Crimee Stoopers of Houston, which in due course awarded $5,000 and later received $20,000 as a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the integrity of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
Previously, it had been reported that the police had interrogated Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the Lakewood Church wall.

“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, Pre-Carinau, and Carnival parties, as well as other activities, which involve an increase in the turpo Current,” said Barroso.
In the past, the Brazilian authorities had imposed a five-day quarantine on tourists who were not free from coronaviral infections.
COVID-19 full protection scheme opened
A virologist, doctor of medical sciences, well-deserved Russian scientist Anatoly Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of full protection against coronaviral infection.
He said that this could be achieved through injection and the use of a nasal vaccine.
Immunoglobulin A is a large number of Immunoglobulins that are used internationally. This does not happen when a vaccine is introduced.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucus, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside of the vaccine, we're the ones that make most of the immunoglobulins of G (antityl).
And if you introduce both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's not yet a decision on double vaccination," the doctor said.
The chief pathologist, UrFO, doctor of medical science, Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of applying nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection was the ability to stop being a COVID-19 carrier.
He added that this would help to maximize the protection of the organism.
David Melik Guseynov, Minister of Health of the Suburban Region, stated earlier that the new coronaviral infection among children would result in a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
He said that this was the picture in other countries where the regular wave of the pandemic had arrived earlier.

I've talked to the cobbler (a long time ago), if you're ready to trade a warm house, a carcass, a favor, a love, and a game of running bitches, then go ahead.

I stopped many of my masters from running after the dog, even though they were due to run away, 200,000 were running away, and I was taking hold of my hand and taking it to the other side.
Eventually, 200,000 chose the owner, not the dog who ran away somewhere.
In Europe, mass protests by vaccine opponents continue
In the Austrian capital city of Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators came to the streets.
They complained about the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make covert vaccination compulsory.
Since February of next year, the poor will have to pay a fine of Euro3,600.
Spaniards, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peace march in Madrid.
Some held posters with the title "This Is a False Pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the certificate is compulsory for access to bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, homes of the elderly and night entertainment facilities.
The introduction of sanitary passports by the authorities in a number of regions of the country has led to an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against tightening restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then it turned into a confrontation with the security guards.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials used watertights.

WHO has found “mycrone” in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strain of the coroner’s “mecron” has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of strain distribution was reported in a WHO report.
According to the organization, as of 9 December, strains have been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
It is, however, that it has not been actively distributed since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of dissemination of the new version of the coronary.
WHO experts fear that a new strain from preliminary data may pass over the rate of the “delta” strain; it is an Indian version of the coronary, which now leads in all countries without exception.
Before that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Gebryesus, stated that Omicron Stamm was able to have a significant impact on the progress of the coronarian pandemic.
Similar findings have also been reached in Britain.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the “mecron” will replace the “delta” in the coming months.
And the number of people sick in Britain alone will be about 1 million, although currently several hundred people are officially ill in the Kingdom and up to 10,000 are estimated.
British experts are predicting tens of thousands of deaths from the strain of “mykron”, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals at peaks every day.
What the British health system will be unable to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfiere-Biontech against the “mecrone” strain is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
The response to the "meicron" of Russian "Sputnik V" is not yet known - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei Center has just begun testing a Russian vaccine on a “mecron” strain.

Russia has warned of a new scheme of fraudsters
The perpetrators began looking for new fraud maneuvers in video messages.
This is referred to by the “Vision” with reference to experts.
According to the Director of Products, Ivideon Zaura Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communications is dipfecture.
In this case, fair video is produced by fraudsters on the basis of real records involving the victim.
This makes it possible for neurosthetics to reproduce accurately the characteristics of a person’s conduct.
Abutalimov added that using a Dipfike, abusers could call a victim’s acquaintance by video link or create a video program involving a copy of a person for blackmailing.
“Such counterfeitings can easily provoke bulling, since a man who has committed a crime can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarians,” said the expert.
The chief system engineer, Varonys Alexander Wetcol, in turn, noted that psychological people have more confidence in others when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video technologies.

Five actions listed to help prevent diabetes
Problems with blood sugar are among the most common in the world.
Some, however, give little or no importance to this.
In time, diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a central role in the prevention of disease.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and turning to conventional water have a positive effect on metabolicism.
Sweet foods increase blood sugar to a dangerous level when it is used in surplus.
So the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying candy and keeping it at home.
The emergence of the disease is affected not only by bad nutrition but also by habits.
A lot of movement is needed to reduce the risk of diabetes.
Experts recommend low - carbon dieting.
Such a diet will not only reduce weight but also protect against rapid fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, many cages must be eaten.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to a sense of wellness, the release of digestive juices, and the enhancement of food intake.

Dr. Paula told me about "the migration of the day off" from the workaholics.
Several factors may contribute to the deterioration of the feeling during the weekend
The cause of the deterioration of self-awareness after work-days is often the “migration day” described by a well-known doctor-endocrinologist, a medical science candidate, a senior academic member of the basic medicine department of IYM, and the scientific director of the clinic of System Medicine, Zuhr Paula, in her telegram channel.
She said that it is particularly common for workaholics who experience headaches, breakups and weaknesses during the weekend.
Dr. Paula noted that apart from the weekly fatigue, there are quite a number of objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changing conditions.
On the weekend, our lives are changing dramatically.
"For a long time, all day, lying on the couch, probably eating more, and drinking less, the doctor reasoned.
And because of overeating and lack of water, it is heavy and broken."
Late recovery plays an additional role.
So if you get up three hours later than normal, you're going to have a reaction called the jetlag.
It comes from travelers who cross a number of time zones.
To determine which factor plays a decisive role in the deterioration of his feelings, Paul recommended that he make sure that the most important changes occur during the weekend.

South African scientists have stated that Pfier vs. “mykron” vaccine has not been effective.
In South Africa, Pfier vs. "mykron" vaccine was reported to be ineffective.
Researchers from the Republic of South Africa have conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfier vaccine against the omicron stamma of coronaviral infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of “omicron”) corresponds to the effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5 per cent of cases of infection with symptoms, which ... leaves the vaccine ' s ability to protect against infection in doubt, as stated in a study published on the MedRxiv portal.
However, experts have clarified that a drug can save you from a severe flow of disease.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that an omicron Stamp coronary might cause a new wave of pandemics in Britain with more hospitalization than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars do you have in your regular products?
The sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
The excess in the diet can lead to Type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and canceral diseases.
Consumers should take into account that hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar by caloric, composition and glycic index - may be included under unknown words in the product.
The label may contain several dozen names, essentially representing sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fruit.
There may also be other curled sugars, such as dextroza (saura derived from corn), levulosa (fruct sugar), melassa (black stream), agawa syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which refer to mono- and dysacarids, and they can be not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, doctoral bulbs, bread, etc.
According to Russia, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to labels and many different names of sugar.
The different types of sugar are different in taste, but whatever name is given to the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or untreated, brown or white - it remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the package, but also that the vegetables, fruit, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than the total amount indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholtz: Gas will lose importance for the FAR in 25 years
The new FAR Chancellor, Olaf Scholtz, stated that gas imports were no longer important for Germany, as the country was continuing to decarbonize the economy.
He said that Germany planned to abandon gas, oil and coal completely by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"That's 25 years from now, the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to the FAR and Europe will play another role," said the chancellor.
Scholtz noted that Germany continues to be committed to Ukraine ' s future transport of Russian natural gas, as this resource is now important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement recording support from Berlin for Ukraine ' s energy transformation.
Formerly, the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annan Berbock, stated that the certification process for the gas pipeline “North Flow - 2” was ongoing.
According to the Minister, in the context of coalition negotiations and the negotiation of a coalition treaty, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should apply to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline had “not yet complied with” the EU's requirements.

The Hackers hacked into Twitter by the Prime Minister of India
The hackers hacked into the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.
The attackers were able to publish a fair report.
It was reported that India had recognized bitcoin as a legitimate payment and that India had already purchased a cryptography.
Modi's office was asked to ignore new messages.
The Prime Minister said that Twitter was a quick response - access to the account was restored.
The country of the Prime Minister of India had already been broken in 2020 and had been called upon to contribute to the fund with a cryptography.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, concluded with the same result as the two previous referendums.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, most New Caledonians voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
The level of participation in this third ballot was significantly lower than in the previous two ballots.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51 per cent (2,755) of New Caledonia's independence from France voted, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians taking part in the elections.
As the French-Presse comments on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt” because the supporters of independence called on the voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the Archipelago prevented the conduct of a full and fair electoral campaign.
Thus, this lack of participation opened the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence and 2020 to 53.3 per cent voted against independence.
The separatists said that they did not recognize the results of the last ballot and would challenge them at the UN.
According to reports on Sunday, 12 December, at the Elysian Palace, the French President, Emmanuel Makron, is required to address the referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia ' s independence has greatly rekindled the recent weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have expressed their preference for the Territory to remain in France, as it is “the most recent European Union presence region in the Pacific”.
"New Caledonia must necessarily remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated on several occasions.
The same statement was made by a Republican candidate, Valery Pecress, who, at the end of October, published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Celtics to remain French.
For its part, Emmanuel Makron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it was not his responsibility”.
Nevertheless, the President added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia”.
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire that the choice of the Kaledonians should be France's choice”.

In Turkey, the first laser-weapon drone in the world was tested
Turkey has successfully tested the first laser-weapon drone in the world.
The "Eren" BPLA was tested at a distance of between 100 and 500 metres, reports Mir-24.
The equipment is capable of neutralizing explosive objects from a distance by means of a laser.
The maximum flight height is 3,000 m.
Once the relevant tests have been carried out, the BPLA should be equipped with Turkish military personnel who will use it to destroy explosive devices without the use of deminers.
The Agency stresses that Turkey is among the six countries in the world that are capable of developing and producing their own drones.

Readers of WSJ criticized an article about Russia’s relationship with the United States.
The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell in which he described his view of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
The author expressed concern about the alleged sacrifice of Ukraine to Russia by the West.
In his article, he convinced the readers of the danger posed by Moscow and allowed a number of offensive remarks to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of the day, Hartwell called on the Western countries “to stand united against Russia”.
WSJ readers disagreed with the position of the American professor.
"This article contains quite a lot of false information," RIA News comments by one of the readers.
“Europe is not ours to lose it, and Ukraine is not our land.
“The United States and NATO allies will never enter into a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine,” noted another.

An earthquake of 5.2 occurred in the Kuryl Islands region
An earthquake with a magnet 5.2 occurred near the tobacco island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 kilometres north-east of the city of North-Kurilsk.
The bed was 92.5 km deep.
In the past, seismologists recorded an earthquake of 7.5 in Peru, which affected 10 people.

Ukraine will begin to produce a new generation of jet drones
In the new Ukrainian-Turkish factory, an ANKA-type unmanned unmanned aircraft (BPLA) will be launched.
This was reported on 11 December by Alexei Arestovic, head of the office of the Ukrainian President.
So they can act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against the manned aircraft.
They're going to have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and all of that," quotes him as a Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA machines, Aristovich said that they were jets, not pistons.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all its characteristics".
The first batch of BPLA is to be produced by the factory at the end of the following year, and is to be concluded by Arestovic.
The ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the day before, Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the military operations of the Joint Forces in Donbassa.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, reported that the construction of a modern military drone plant had begun.
He said that Ukraine intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Minovores entered into an agreement to build a centre in Kiev district to train personnel and to test and maintain the Turkish Bayraktar BPLA.
The Ukrainian leader's office's press office described the memorandum as “a major real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport
Lions fled at the Singapore airport of Changi.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions on one of the aircraft.
The publication notes that it remains unknown which country they were brought from and to Singapore.
One of the running lions has settled on the roof of the container.
The animals couldn't get away from him because of the security net set up by a close-up.
The opposition ended after the arrival at the airport of Mandai Wildlie Group, which is responsible for all Singapore zoos.
They have displaced lions by wires with a tranquilizer and are planning to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
It has previously been reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion fled from its master and was walking through the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and the people were not hurt.
Experts warned of the cancer threat due to vitamin B9
Research has shown that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned of this.
Experts believe that there is strong evidence that people who do not suffer from a phylic acid deficiency are less likely to suffer from certain types of cancer, such as corrugal cancer.
However, the excess of the necessary dose on the other hand contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor Beth Kitchin of the University of Alabama in Birmingham recommends that we monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms a day.
The risk of cancer is increased only if the figure is substantially deviated from that figure in a larger or lower direction.
Kitchin recommends that vitamin B9 not be taken in pills without a doctor's recommendation, that dosage be monitored and that we avoid cotton with milk and other foods that contain phylic acid be avoided.
In the past, a nutrition consultant, Rachel Fein, called phylic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is contained, inter alia, in the avocado, Fein recommended that men eat the fruit more often after 50 years.
In Britain, by April, about 75,000 people may die because of omicron stamma
Projections by British scientists show that because of the spread of the coronary omicron stamma in the next five months, up to 75,000 people may die in England without tightening restrictive measures in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, referring to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which broadcasts TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the British Cabinet Emergency Advisory Group, by April 2022 at least 25,000 deaths due to Omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the height of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 people per day.
“Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be necessary to avoid overloading the National Health Service if the omicron Stamp is more contagious than the delta version and existing vaccines cannot exclude infection”, said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Previously, the British Health Security Agency informed that if the rate at which omicron stamma spreads were maintained at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection would be detected by the end of the year.
By mid-December, however, Omicron strains could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1,898 cases of omicron-stamp coronary infections have been detected in Britain, of which 633 have been detected in recent days.
On 9 December, however, the head of British Minsdrava, Sajid Javid, indicated that, in reality, this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for super-hazards has increased by a quarter in the world
The construction of super-hauts this year and the next year's orders are beating all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and to combat climate change.
In the World Register of Ships, the number of registered yachts was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In the climate change era, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and the money to swim 50 million pounds and above will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, they are increasing.
This year, 25 per cent more courts were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say it wasn't 20 years old on the market.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear contamination on the ground and prefer to escape the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If all of these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them are working far away and the talks are going crazy.
Broker Will Christy told the newspaper that shipyards accept orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that the customers are willing to pay more if their boat is ready for a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super rich could afford it," he said.
In Western society, many criticize the behavior of the rich and call it Decadental.
The wealthy, say sociologists, do not want to understand that when they are deprived of their space travel, their lives on yachts, or their own airplanes, cause resentment in society because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with all mankind.
Economists call on Governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they realize that such mobility will make it extremely difficult for them to do so.
In the meantime, the number of super-Akhts ordered is impressive, but their characteristics are also impressive.
Of 1,200 vessels, 27 are over 100 metres long.
The Norwegian billionaire Recke builds a rev Ocean yacht, which is 183 feet [183 m] long.
Once you're down on the water, it'll be the biggest boat in the world.
The yacht provides for a “sun basin” as well as a submarine designed to study deep sea.
In the existing super-Akhtas, helicopters, cinemas, and some of them, such as McGregor's yacht, were common ground for unity. Professor of economic anthropology at the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk, said that, compared to the total number of greenhouse gas selectives, the carbon footprint produced by super-riches was insignificant.
But it's symbolic, given that the world's multibillionaires are just over 2,000 people.
This is just another example of the overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emission trail of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average world’s population.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, the world ' s largest pollutant, Roman Abrahamovic, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that fell into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two thirds of the emissary was laid on his Eclipse yacht 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner is not on board the boat, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and command the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Super-hazard owners do not cause other people to feel sympathy when, like the richest Australian woman Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, they complain over YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marines for ships that are less than 100 feet [50 m] away.
A dangerous one-week dose of alcohol has been determined leading to intestinal cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of cancer.
This is what the Daily Express says.
Experts have concluded that the use of four or more drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
However, the risk of developing the disease is increasing with an increase in alcohol consumption.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of intestinal cancer than women.
The exact reason for the development of this type of oncology cannot be determined by scientists simply noting that certain factors lead to a harmful process.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, more precisely, loved dogs, convinced that these creatures were very intelligent.
But even they have no idea how developed these quadruped pets are.
Over the years, biologists have experimented with various experiments to see for sure how animal intelligence can develop.
Although the dog’s vocabulary may not be as extensive as the human one, a new study proves that the dog may react consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in the Scientificalert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poems, they can't understand politics, they can't understand economics, they can't understand art, they can often fool their masters.
Some species, experts say, show better results in understanding human language, but statistics for precise conclusions are not sufficient.
For example, some breeds are traditionally regarded as dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and that their ability to learn is not inferior to that of a two - year - old.

In Ukraine, we have prepared for the U.S. and Russia trade
The US and Russia will “trade” on Ukraine's entry into NATO, said analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the publication “Glauded”.
In his view, Washington and Moscow were planning to continue negotiations shortly on United States assurances that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Baiden concerning the right of “to enter anywhere”.
If you're offered something that you know is unacceptable, you know, selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not going to trade, you're just going to send a offerer.
And there's a trade for Ukraine," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine, but rather to engage in dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparations are carried out in secret, quickly and immediately into the offensive, rather than waiting for the group to discover and deploy the force of resistance,” he said.
China stimulates the railway industry
China's advanced technology has attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Railway Transport and Equipment Exhibition, 2021, held in Zhuzhou Province/Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and detect technical failures, noted the representative of How Zhaoven.
High-speed trains passing through the Chinese-Laos railway line, which was introduced earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure greater reliability and efficiency of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased rail exports and many countries in Asia and Europe have witnessed “Chinese speed”.
In May this year, CRRC Zhuzou Locomotive Co., Ltd came off China's first two-tier high-speed electricity trains designed for export to Europe.
At a maximum working speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will travel on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the pilot operation of the subway train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the metro line linking the centre of Istanbul to the airport of the city.
This line of the subway will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest subway line in Turkey at 120 kilometres per hour.
“The Chinese Railway Equipment Industry is one of the most innovative and highly innovative international innovation industries,” said Fan Yasian, head of the China Committee for International Trade Facilitation (CCISM/AC.M).
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-class equipment in the world market,” said Fan Yasyan.
After more than 60 years of intensive work, with a number of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of rail equipment, with a full range of supporting tools and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosyan, the country ranks first on the level of electrification of railways and on high-speed and urban railways.
A biologist listed early signs of dementia
The candidate for biological sciences, Simeon Goloshikin, spoke with Radio Sputnik, listing early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive disorders, such as failure to concentrate, plan, and lower abstract thinking.
A discussion is under way that hearing loss can be both an early occurrence of Alzheimer ' s disease and a risk factor.
Holoshikin stressed that the causes of dementia may be neurogenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and the atherosclerosis of the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
A biologist noted that medical professionals today do not know effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, prevention must begin in time.
He said that learning foreign languages and active communication would help to reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical workload, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbys that require intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic
“There are recommendations for the application of different BADs, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still being discussed in the scientific community,” said Goloshikin.
“The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of a moderate level of physical workload, regular training in cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbys that require intensive involvement in memory and thinking logic,” said Goloshikin.
Previously, a British philanthropic organization stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 and over.
The medical authorities called the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first warning sign is vision problems, which make it difficult for a patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of a growing dementia was that experts called aphasia, a state where a person can't find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
A neurologist demanded Saakasville to be treated abroad
The former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakasville, needs psycho-nerving treatment and rehabilitation abroad, and told journalists about the neuroscientist Otar Toidze, who is part of a clinic of doctors established under the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saaczville] neurologic status is the leading cause of his illness.
The problems of movement, coordination and variability are stable,” said the expert, noting that this is not beyond the normative framework and that the ex-president must now be sent to special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neurorehab and psycho-nerving rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia,” noted Toidze, demanding that Saakasville be treated in a special institution that is not available in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began sabotage after he was disciplined by prison officials.
Georgian policy quickly succeeded in abolishing punishment and restoring its former rights.

In Spain, there were protests against COVID passports
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, there were protests against the mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate, transmitting the Europa Press Agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID was compulsory for access to bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, elderly homes and night entertainment facilities.
Many of the manifestos came into action without masks.
With slogans on their poster, they accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, a passport for vaccination will also be required for more than 50 people to enter entertainment facilities and restaurants.
Protesters in that city announced a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus have been detected since the start of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
The Russian Federation is also planning to impose restrictions on non-vaccination.
The Government introduced the Single QR Codes Bill to the State on 12 November.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit mass events, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail trades with either a certificate of immunization or carried-out disease or a vaccine-free medical treatment.
The same rules will be established for train and aircraft travel.

The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will bring together President Ci Jinping 1 trillion Yuan, but will also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
Taiwu’s mountain resort in Zhangjiakow, near the winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with Chinese people.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, greening work is also under way: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many parts of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakow, there are snow problems.
The main challenge for the long term is to provide comfortable and interesting recreation on Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become ever-present.
However, it is far from happening.
The Game Adviser, Justin Downs, said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry had changed to a lack of awareness.
Every winter, more and more Chinese are heading for the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to create a skiing culture here, said Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and create the necessary recreational infrastructure.
The 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunley, near the winter Olympic Games.
He noted that in recent years there had been a boom of winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chongley, no local people were suffering without work.
More and more shops are being opened in the country selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open the public kitchen with the dishes of the national kitchen.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station on Taiwan.
China seeks to create a prosperous winter sport industry, its athletes must be the leaders of the largest international competition, and its resorts and equipment must reach the global level.
More than 500 million people worldwide may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, stated WHO
More than 500 million people around the world can be forced into extreme poverty because of the coronarian pandemic, which has slowed human progress in the area of universal access to health care, declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the International Day for Universal Health Coverage, on 12 December, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic had led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, causing excessive stress in health systems.
In this regard, immunization coverage has declined for the first time in 10 years, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
In WHO and the WB, it was emphasized that the pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their pocket”.
In October, UN Secretary-General Antônio Guterres stated that the coronarian pandemic had forced more than 100 million people into poverty and that more than four billion people had little social support.

Reuters: The Taiwan Minister was suspended from broadcast at the "Sammit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
The statement by Taiwan Audrey Tan, Minister of Digital Technology, at the panel discussion during the U.S.-organized “Sammit for Democracy” was translated into a video-free mode, and the recording of the summit on YouTube shows.
The Reuters Agency, with reference to the sources, claims that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason for this was a map on which Taiwan was identified in a color separate from the PRC, which considers the island to be its territory.
The map presented by Ms. Tan was drawn up by CIVICUS, a South African non-governmental organization, and ranked the countries of the world as civil rights.
Taiwan has been identified as “free” in green and the DPRK, DPRK, Laos and Viet Nam as “closed”.
After the Minister showed the map, the image was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the views of the discussants “do not necessarily express the position of the US Government”.
The PRC was not invited to the “Sammit for Democracy”.
Sources of Reuters note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwan Minister may have been contrary to the “one China” policy pursued by Washington.
One agency source stated that, following a map demonstration, the U.S. National Security Council had angryly contacted the State Department, accusing him of showing Taiwan to be a separate country.
The Washington “Sammit for Democracy” took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
At the summit's “zero day” Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the editor-in-chief of the “New Gazette” Dimitri Muratov called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be spent on charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary Sovbes of the Russian Federation, Yuri Averyanov, stated that the summit was carrying “Antirossian and anti-Chinese charges”.

A New Shepard spaceship with six tourists on board made a sub-orbital flight
The New Shepard spacecraft, Blue Origin, with six tourists on board, made a suborbital flight on Saturday, 11 December.
The tour of the company’s website took a total of more than ten minutes, after which the passenger capsule came down to Earth, reports TASS.
The launch of the carrier rocket was carried out from a launch site near Van Horn, Texas, U.S.A.
The ship had risen just over 100 kilometres, and space tourists were in a state of weightlessness.
The carrier rocket itself landed on the site of the launch site.
Blue Origin successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard with passengers on board on July 20.

But what's the number of children, the age, the pension fund, etc?
Write that they're "shits, they didn't pay back the money."
That's how many children they have, and when they have kids, it's none of your business until they're gonna hang you on your neck.
And since it's out of the question, what right do you have to judge them?
I guess it's just in education.
The parents (of themselves) who have been elected dictate their own rules, frankly spit on the existing ones.
What about other areas of life, justice, etc.?
There is no law written for them.

China is strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in land-locked cities
A joint mechanism for the prevention and control of the State Council of the PRC has issued a circular ordering the strengthening of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in the cities where the land crossing points are located, with a view to preventing further smuggling from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the said cities must provide a negative result of the COVID-19 nuclear acid test received within 48 hours of departure.
Those who come to towns where land passes are located must, upon arrival, pass at least one test for nucleine acids of COVID-19.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day when the respective provincial administrative units define and publish the zones of the said cities, until 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land crossing points that meet certain conditions may consider establishing buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The long orthopaedic mattress of OK Bazis is one of the most affordable models in the ruler.
A practical Balancing Balance Foam gives the mattress all the necessary orthopaedic properties, but keeps the price at the budgetary level.
This product is the optimal combination of price and quality.
Pena Balance is a modern material that comes from PIP.
The filler is hypollerogenic and secure.
That's why foam is widely used in industry.
Her integrity and reliability are confirmed by a special certificate obtained in Europe, where such requirements are much more stringent than those of the Russian Federation.
Another important quality of Balance Foam is its orthopedicity: the material maintains the right state of the person throughout sleep.
Because of the matrasa foam, the rigidity is below average, so the product is considered to be quite soft.
SuperSprings are the main vehicle in the mattress.
It's marked by the contents of independent springs, where 256 elements were placed by square metre.
The practical block carries up to 100 kg to the sleeping place, distributes the load and adapts the surface under sleep to enhance the orthopaedic qualities of the foam.
The manufacturer shall provide a choice between a spring block of 12 cm and 18 cm without changing the final value.

At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we described the “heat withdrawal” between Russia and the United States.
Sergey Ryabkov, president of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, in an interview with the Israelis, assessed the prospects for the relationship between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not started yesterday.
One-sided negative predictability is present, but with regard to some prospect of improving relations, everything is totally unpredictable.
That is the sad conclusion of the long journey we have taken with both the current administration and Trump and Obama.
The problem didn't start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US ' s desire to impose on Russia a variety of approaches.
The heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that they would not risk giving optimistic forecasts of prospects for better relations and not expecting a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress had been made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and that Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Formerly, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with American State Secretary Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
The virus warned of the risk of vaccination with a nasal drug for COVID outside hospitals
The nasal vaccine from COVID-19 may create allergies and require medical assistance, so the first points to infuse the drug need not be organized at airports or shopping centres.
This was reported by the TASS, a virologist, correspondent member of the Ran, a laboratory for bioananologies, microbiology and virology at the University of Novosibir State University, Sergei Netes.
It's easier to organize the vaccine stations at airports and shopping centres, but I'd only do that at first place in health facilities.
The fact is, there is a chance of an allergy response to such a vaccine, but it's very small, but it's desirable that a person sit next to a doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that operate literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary,” he said.
According to the virologist, it would be possible to consider vaccinations in shopping centres when there was experience in the use of the drug.
He also stressed that when a nasal vaccine was used, it was important that it be placed on the mucus in the nose.
However, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the inflammable nose is wrinkled after injection.

Serbia produced 2 million doses of “Sputnik V” vaccine
Satellite V vaccin is the most popular in Serbia.
Serbia produced about 2 million doses of Russian “Sputnik V” vaccine, as described by the Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of Nadez Popović.
“The State Institute of Torlak has so far produced about 2 million doses of the “Sputnik V” vaccine, expecting a minimum of 4 million in the coming period,” said Popović.
According to him, the Russian vaccine was the most popular among Serbs.
The Republic is therefore planning to purchase an additional million doses of vaccine from Russia.
The Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of Serbia also expressed interest in producing the State-owned satellite V vaccine and satellite Light.
The Russian Prime Minister, Mikhail Mishustin, reported that the Russian Federation had placed nearly two million doses of domestic vaccine for coronaviral infection, “Sputnik V”, in Serbia.

Benarti Prime Orto S1000 145x190.
Prime Orto S-10000 with different sides of rigidity, total mattress heights of 22 cm.
Maximum permissible load per bedroom up to 150 kg.
The base of the mattress is the independent spring block "S-1,000" (1,000 spring per sleeping place).
Each spring is located in a separate cloth pocket, allowing the spring to distribute its body load correctly.
In order to provide additional protection to the spring unit, an insulating layer from the forelock has been added, dividing the mattress and spring fillers.
On the one side of the mattress is a layer of coconut carpet 3 cm high, which adds to the rigidity and permanence of the mattress.
On the other side of the mattress, a layer of coconut cochineal 3 cm and a natural latex 1 cm was added.
Natural latex has anatomical effects and endurance properties.
The mattress is made from a cotton scaffold that was made on the environmental material of Hollcon.
The tissue was treated with a special antibacterial poll known as Sanitized (Sweden).
Propagation destroys mold mushrooms completely and prevents micro-organisms, dust mites and micro-bes from developing.
The mattress is equipped with four suitable flippers as well as aerators for additional ventilation of layers of the mattress.
Perimeter matrases are further strengthened by an artificial latex frame, which greatly increases his life.

In Britain, 1,239 cases of omicron-Stamma coronavirus-RT in Russian were recorded per day
In Britain, 1,239 cases of new omicron stum coronary infections were detected 24 hours a day.
Sky News reports on this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases were reported in England, 38 in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in Britain reached 3,137.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted that 75,000 people might die in England by April because of the outbreak of coroner caused by the strain of “mecron”.
Sand has warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
President Dimitri Peskov, Spokesperson for the Russian Federation, commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including the alleged “invasion” into the country.
“It is impossible to impose restrictions on Russia and not to suffer on itself”, said the official representative of the Kremlin on the television channel Russia.
Sand says it's "understanding everything in the world."
It has previously been reported that the United States considers the introduction of anti-Russian energy sanctions as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to impose restrictions aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
Herman Greef, head of Sberbank, is convinced that this is impossible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to withdraw from France.
This was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV on 12 December.
The independence was opposed by 96.5 per cent of the voters.
3.51% of the population of the South Pacific Archipelago supported independence from France.
The results were cancelled by 2.99% of the ballots.
The voting rate on that day was very low: about 55 per cent of the population of the Archipelago had come to the sites.
In the view of the experts, the low appearance was due to the separatists ' calls to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronaviour.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians expressed their opposition to independence from France in a referendum.
A referendum on independence had already been held in the region in 2018.
Most of the inhabitants supported the discovery of the Archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Some 270,000 people live on the Archipelago and have special administrative and territorial status.
The 1998 Agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian Administration provides that the region may vote on its independence twice as many as two years.

WHO tentatively considers “meicron” to be less dangerous than “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that the “mecron” is less dangerous than the delta-stampme coronary.
However, there is evidence of a reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines in the new version of COVID-19.
According to information on 9 December, “mecron” is registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and a significantly modified anti-human profile of the protein strain “mecron” suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transmission of the option.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it (“the severity of the disease” - Rev.) may be less severe than in the case of the “delte”, as reported in the WHO technical communication.
The organization notes that so far, all reported cases of “omicrone” infection in the EU are easily or unsymptically occurring.
However, preliminary data indicate that the new strain is spread faster than the deltas.
In Russia, there are two cases of Omicron-Stamma infection.
They've previously been immunized, they've reported to the Gamalei Center.
The head of Roswanadzor Anna Popovah stated that there was no reliable evidence yet that the new version of the coronary was less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine four scenarios for the Greens were named
The Executive Secretary of the Supreme Council, Wadim Denisenko, listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State could be left without the support of the West and could also compromise on Donbass.
That's what Denisenko told us about on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the "Glauded" portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called the “ideal storm”, implies that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development will contribute to the profound crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“The prices of key goods that we traditionally export... ... internal protests and the confrontation of power with key FIGs (financial and industrial groups. — ED.),” added the ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the situation: “war against all”.
This forecast will come true in the event of a high level of concern in the world policy, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
Because of this state of affairs, Ukraine ' s leadership may compromise on Donbassa, which may result in domestic confrontation.
At the end of the summer, the position of the Green Sea will be weakened, with a probability of 50 to 55 per cent, according to the former Nardepa.
The third option for the development of Ukrainian policy is to confront the non-consensual groups of the Green population and the President, which may lead to the capture of control over the force bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
During this version of the crisis, Greenski will start “reforming power”, Denisenko added.
Another scenario is to turn the Greens into "the father of the nation."
This may be the result of an event that will be a great shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to trigger reactions from external partners and increase Ukraine's support,” Denisenko said.
This option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made catastrophe or an aggressive act by Russia, and is considered an ex-deputate.
However, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, a survey of the sociological group “Reating” revealed that the Ukrainian President's rating had dropped to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since his Head of State was elected.
The analysts predicted a situation in which, in the immediate election of the President of Ukraine for the Greens, only 21.8 per cent would vote, while 14.5 per cent would vote in the case of the ex-President of Petra Porosenko.
Of all those interviewed, only 19.3 per cent of the President ' s support was expressed.

The matrase Beautyson Sense Hard S600 mini Sint has a compact invoice, a comfortable viscosity and rigidity, a characteristic of endurance and longevity.
Butison's "Sens" brand is designed for the healthy sleep of people suffering from joint and vascular disease.
The design ensures a uniform burden-sharing over the surface and an expressed comfort effect.
The base of the Butison Matras Sance Hard S600 Min Sint is an independent spring unit S600 mini with reduced spring height.

Coconut is a hypollerogenic material that gives the mattress a high profile of moisture exchange and air permeability.
The outside mattress case is made of a thick accard with synthetic fibers.

A poet arrested for an act in Red Square: "In Eutushenko's quote, they give 10 days, here she is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Walchenko was arrested for ten days.
A WWE student was detained in the Red Square with a poster on which a hashtag #poetrossienige was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Evgenia Eutushenko.
A protocol was drawn up for Alexander under an administrative article on the repeated violation of the public action.
For the first time, he was arrested on 23 January at the Pashkin Square, a rally in support of Alexei Nvali.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now, unfortunately lost interest in it, to the decline of a common culture in Russia, and also to the small hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems online under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted a young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to elaborate on the messedge of his message.
How did the police treat you this time and earlier?
What was asked in the department, how was your action commented on?
This time, staff members were more correct, detention being as polite as possible, as ridiculous as it may sound in some context of the word.
The Pushkins were taken by the OMONOVs and taken hard.
Asked standard, motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if they didn't, they understood.
Except for all four sides of the monkey, everything was perfect, but I knew what I was going to.
And if after this hashtag, I start writing my poems, at least for a few people, I'm going to go for 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak the Tumba-jumba language alone.
At public and official events, people speak the language of the people so that everyone can understand what happened in Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in their mother tongue through an interpreter.
It's a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angel Merkel speaks Russian beautifully, but he's still looking for the help of an interpreter.
Also at official events, there is a transcript on the old age of the author, and the stenographer is not required to speak several languages.

Researchers described how potatoes help combat age violations
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients, which contribute to better blood flow and lower cholesterol levels.
The roots contain vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, pholyasic acid and pantotenic acid.
All these elements help to operate the body's systems.
Potatoes also help to combat age violations.

For the most good, however, it is better to put the roots or cook them than to burn them on oil.
Previously, The Daily Express had warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, like other high-glymic products.
These are carbon-containing products that are rapidly fissile to sugar, such as sugar, sweet nonalcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Commersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in production in private secondary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products could currently replace imports only.
The Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Endex.
Nominations for departure
In 2015, the right holders of the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate RuNet sites and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazarian, director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some -- Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix -- survived with a regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, the Lostfilm, which is available in the search edition of both Yandex and Google, can be viewed with pirate copies of the Netflix Game of the Kalmar and the Tenderness of the director Anna Melickian, the original series of Russia's largest video service iv (which is part of AIV).
Kinogo, which is also available for the production of search engines, can see Encantto's animation, but it appears from the quality of the video that it's a so-called screen (a pirate copy of the movie in the cinema).
Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, is a series of "Univers. 10 Years Later" by the TV channel TNT (in the "Gazprom Media").

Matras Dimax Micro Ultimaith, 160x190
Orthopaedic spring matrase, Micro Ulmite.
The model is convenient because it has two slightly soft surfaces - high stiffness and slightly higher than the average.
The product consists of only qualitative and final fillers, which have proved to be exclusively on the best side.
Springs: A cluster of independent "mippocet" springs is installed at the centre of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the bedroom, which operate entirely autonomously.
It is their function that provides a unique point structure.
Microbet is the most frequent of the variety of Dimax spring blocks, and therefore has a strong orthopaedic effect and is considered to be the premier.
Fillers: From top and bottom of the spring, combinations of carpets and natural latex are installed.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has a latex, the other has a coconut carpet.
This dance of fillers has long been a classic because it conveys not only the orthopaedic properties but also the anatomical properties of the mattress.
If the coira provides the right back support, the latex gives the surface adaptation to the human body.
Chehol: The model is supplied in Aloe Vera's simple tack.
If the customer wants it, you can make it both static and static.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, and the recommended load on the bedroom is 170 kg.
Guarantee and security: guarantee period - 3.
Matras received all the necessary certificates and documents, which confirm his full safety and security of operation.
Orthopedic foam used in the mattress has CertiPUR.
Estonian scientists will seek life in Vienna
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday “Acquatal Chamber”.
The purpose of launching missions in five years is to assess whether the clouds of Venus are suitable for life and then search for life there.
For the project, Tarto scientists have proposed tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the Venus clouds.
To date, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the nearest planet, are too acidic to allow life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an earth - type planet.
During the third mission, a trial from Venus must arrive.
Let's assume that if we find life there, the main question is whether it's Earth-like or different.
If so, it will be evident that earth’s life did not begin on earth.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said Michael Paulso, director of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project.

The metabolic ones will change Russian business.
The theme of the metabolic population became popular this autumn when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, the event was an important signal: the biggest player had confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction among people.
So the business in Russia, like around the world, will invest in creating its own metabolic and then remixing it.
The metabolic population should be seen as a continuation of the objective trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to create remote interactions in a pandemic environment is tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt to them operational models.
From the third point of view, they are a logical continuation of the digitalization of assets when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are digitized.

British economist failed to predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict for the year 2022 because he thought such attempts would fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictableness and that any trend may change the movement.
The most important factor remains the coronary pandemic, and second, inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether or not the price increases for goods were temporary.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of the endless generosity of central banks had already expired” and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates on inflation would be aligned with the expected growth rate of GDP.
O'Neill noted that, against the background of the pandemic, the continuation of super-flexible economic policies could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, O'Neill summarized the issue of productivity growth as well as poverty and climate change.
Michael Schulgin, Head of Global Studies, Investment Discovery, stated earlier that positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remained, with the potential for growth less.
Among the risks to the dollar, Schulgin referred to FRF monetary policy, oil price dynamics and fears against the coronary pandemic.

The Russians gave around 4.5 per cent of the country ' s GDP to road dealers
As a result of the 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion roubles on new vehicles, 28 per cent more than during the same period last year, the Agency's statistics show that Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) was used.
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the State on supporting citizens and the economy during the coronarian pandemic.
In the past September, at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount was comparable to more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s domestic gross product (GDP) for 2020.
The Russian market is dominated by the Korean brand Kia by income.
In 10 months this year, he managed to produce 325.7 billion roubles, an increase of almost 24 per cent over the previous year.
The Myundai brand of Kai has an even larger growth rate of more than 35 per cent, while car sales are estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In leading positions, this brand, and in raising the weighted average car price, grew by almost 21 per cent per year in Hyundai, to 1.94 million roubles - only in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, sales from Korean brands have not increased significantly: according to statistics from the automakers ' committee of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia has done 9.4 per cent more in the same period than in the previous year.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
The three monetary leaders of Japan, Toyota, spent 275.5 billion roubles on their cars in 10 months, an increase of 14 per cent over the previous year.
Following the Japanese is Mercedes-Benz, with 266.1 billion roubles (+75 per cent) - both sales (37 per cent) and the average weighted car price (almost 28 per cent, to 8.2 million roubles).
"The Mercedes-Benz also has a good increase in sales and weighted average prices - more than BMW - from here to here and a greater increase in financial capacity," explained the NPRI director Tatyana Arabaji.
China’s brands, which have also significantly increased the financial capacity this year, demonstrate the rate of growth of sales.”
Russian Lada shows averages (plus 28 per cent) on income growth and spent 229.4 billion roubles on Russian cars in 10 months.
At last year's financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales fell in things in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
The Russians spent 12 billion roubles on extra-roads and pick-ups in 10 months, compared to 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems in the supply of auto-components and industrial disruptions covering the whole world, the car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same AVTWA increased the cost of the Lada models seven times a year, the last trip (88 to 10,000 roubles) occurred in late November.
Censorships for their products and other car manufacturers are regularly rewrote.
The volume of the Russian road market will continue to increase in monetary terms, in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation makes its contribution and the desire of the car-camps to pay back past losses, experts believe.
In the face of a shortage of cars, I think many car clinics have even been able to partially shift to the consumer the costs of past periods that they could not have invested in the price of cars before,
Says "VTB Capital" analyst on Vladimir Bespalov's car runway.
I believe that, financially, car manufacturers are feeling very good right now, maintaining a high-marginal value of sales."
The indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which has been observed during 2021, the price of new cars is increasing faster than inflation, as the expert explains.
In the long term, the market will grow in both quantitative and monetary terms, but mainly through inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As supply increases, the opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian author will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the cost of the cars slows down, the manufacturers will be able to earn their income from the amounts, notes the independent consultant on the Sergey Burgazilia vehicle industry.
Given the increased demand and the lack of supply, manufacturers are now trying to make the most of each car sold, notes Bourgaslies.
The increase in the production of machines is not expected in the next six months, and in the Russian Federation there is also a lack of confidence among citizens in the future.
Against the background of the market situation, cars have proved to be a good investment site - a car purchased a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold more expensive than its original cost, notes the expert.
Byden spoke about the movement of the United States military to Ukraine in the event of Russia ' s invasion.
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending United States troops to Ukraine in the event of Russia's “invasion”.
That statement was made by Joe Byden, President of the United States.
"Never has there been such a plan," said the head of the White House, answering the journalist's question as to whether the US had abandoned this idea.
Byden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalated, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using United States troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not worth the agenda.
Byden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States would transfer forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovakia).
“We will have to send more U.S. and Nate troops to the eastern flank, and B9 to all the NATO countries in respect of which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia,” said Byden.
In the past, President Dimitri Peskov, the spokesman of the Russian Federation, stressed that Moscow had no intention of invading Ukraine.
He pointed out, however, that Moscow saw the problem of the military use by Kiev of the drones set up by Turkey and that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.

If such a number calls a fraudster, such as a "MAD official" or another force structure, it is not effective to drop it immediately and it is likely that you will not be able to put it on the blacklist.

A Russian film named Oscar, "Breaking Fingers", received a European Film Academy award (also known as "The European Oscar") in the "Better Mounting" nomination, reports "Moscow Kombola".
The competition jury, which voted online because of the complex epidemiological situation, assessed the remarkable skill of filmmakers.
The maximum number of awards received this time is a film by Yasmila Zhbanic (Bosnia) "Where are you going, Aida?"
The main heroine of the tape is a translator to the United Nations mission, which is trying to save its family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As to the drama of "Breaking Fingers" by Kira Kovalenko (the graduate of the workshop of Alexander Sokurov), this film tells of the complex relationship of a powerful father who wants to be freed from the fatherly care of grown children in North Ossetia.
