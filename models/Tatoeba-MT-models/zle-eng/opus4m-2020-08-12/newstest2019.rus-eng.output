Number of new recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbas
Andrei Marochko, the spokesman of the People ' s Militia for the self-proclaimed Lugano People ' s Republic (LPR), stated that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbas.
He said that Kiev was planning “somehow to complete the units”.
“The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to perform military service in Ukraine, the mass dismissals have resulted in a low number of units”, said Morocco, quoted as “RIA News”.
He also did not rule out that the real figures of Ukrainian military personnel could be increased if necessary.
The so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO) was launched in 2014-2017 and was later replaced by a joint force (JS) operation.
This measure was expected to enhance the role of Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbasa was aggravated by the murder of Alexander Zakharchenko, head of NAM.
The NAM authorities described what happened as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several persons involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversification had been organized by Ukrainian intelligence services.

The head of the British MIDA compared the EU with the Soviet Union and the prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of enslaving the community.
The diplomat made this statement at the meeting of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham on Sunday, 30 September.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from the community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity,” said the Minister.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to withdraw from the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes The Gazette.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the Brexit negotiations had stalled.
It thus commented on the outcome of the European Union informal summit in Strasbourg.
The Brexit decision was adopted in 2016 following a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London has left the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.
Two dogs were given to the PDR President of South Korea
The President of South Korea, Mun Jae In, received two puppies from the North Korean leader Kim Jong after his visit to Phenyang.
Reuters refers to the representative of the South Korean President ' s administration.
" During the summit, a pair of phunsan dogs were offered as a gift.
They were received on Thursday," the agency reported.
For about a year, “as an aid for their adaptation”, the North Korean side handed over several kilograms of feed.
A gift was given in honour of the inter-Korean summit, which took place from 18 to 20 September in Pongyang.
Phunsan hunting species of North Korean wolves were named from a district of the DPRK.
As noted by the agency, Moon loves animals, he already has two such dogs, given to him by former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
Dogs are not the only gift.
Kim Jong Eun also handed over two tons of matsutake mushrooms to his colleague.
He ordered the distribution of these mushrooms to the Korean-headed families who had not yet reunited with their loved ones from the DPRK.
The head of the Albanian village stopped the hunger strike for the benefit of the inhabitants
The official reported on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the village stated that the situation had stalled, that the district administration was not responding to its demands and that it needed to carry out its work.
In addition, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has begun an audit of the situation, and the heating organization of the SPC has promised to start work on preparing the system for the winter heating period of the village of Siberia next week.
The villagers also formed and took away a mass collective appeal to the Governor of the Altay Province, “regarding the current catastrophic situation”.
Boronin himself reported that he was normal and that he was fully in charge of the hunger strike.
As Boronin explained, the villages of Siberia and Rogulin have centralized heating systems, and therefore the authorities of the Pervomay district must exercise their powers to prepare for winter.
To date, however, no one has begun these work.
The head of the village also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the Government of the Altay Province and against the financial policy of Gaspromregionalgas Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the villages for the winter, Boronin required “immediately to establish a fully-fledged community site in the municipality with the relevant staff units”.

Telegram users complained about a malfunction in the new version
The iPhone users complained about the problems of the Telegram Messinger after the update of 28 September.
The user's phone number can be found by his address
The complaints relate to guesses with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after updating, the application shows a white screen or closes immediately.
Messinger's representatives responded to the malfunction.
According to them, the problem could be the migration of information to a new Swift application.
The Telegram has temporarily suspended the automatic updating of the application before correcting the problems.
On 13 April, the Tagan court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor ' s claim to block the messing up of Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the liaison operators began implementing the decision.
The reason was the failure of the Messinger Administration to provide the FSB with the keys to de-encrypt the correspondence necessary to obtain terrorist data.
In August, Telegram changed its policy of confidentiality and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of the terrorist suspect when a court decision was reached.
Telegram's audience decreased by 1.2 million after blocking in the Russian Federation

It was important to throw it most of the time, I'm happy for the guys who went out to realize the numerical advantage.
We've played pretty well for most of the time, but we couldn't do anything about it.
At last, the red light lit up behind the gates.
We knew Minsk would come out loaded at the game, try, and it did.
The game has become the determining goal, the winning goal we've scored in unequal compositions.
We were able to spend a good third period today, despite the fact that we missed an early goal in this section and understood that it would be difficult to do so.
But we played very well in defense, we didn't give a lot of chances to the rival, we weren't allowed to catch us on the shift, and Denamo didn't have multiple advantage attacks, so it ended well for us, and Hartley's Om club press service says.

Ilon Musk is forced to leave the post of Chief of the Tesla Board of Directors
The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission and founder Tesla Ilon Musk settled their dispute in the fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, as part of the agreements reached, Muska would have to resign as head of the Tesla Board of Directors.
In doing so, the Commission allowed Masku to retain the post of head of Tesla.
It is noted that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount is recovered from Tesla.
In doing so, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company should appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American businessman on the list of 50 richest people on the planet, according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX Space Corporation, Neurallink Neurallink neurotechnician and Tesla Electrician Development and Co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission had previously filed a complaint with the Director General of Tesla Ilona Mask because of his Twitter report about a possible ransom to the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares on a fixed price exchange at $420.
The value of the $420 share was allegedly “due to the importance of this number in the marijuana culture”, reported earlier to the Bloomberg agency, with reference to the director of the security department of the Stephen Peykin Commission.
At the same time, Ilon Musk subsequently refused his plans to buy the shares.
Commenting on a lawsuit filed against him by the United States Security and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered the allegations of fraud to be unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and upset by these claims.
" Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove I didn't break it in any way," said the businessman in the CEBC interview.
In August, however, a group of shareholders from Tesla filed a collective action against Maska, complaining about the financial losses suffered.
The plaintiffs claimed that the business man’s posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the business man's Twitters had been misleading, which had forced the Tesla shareholders to buy paper at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that Ilonma Muska’s reckless remarks led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Muska accused the head of Cetron Research of trading fraud.
However, if Musk were unable to resolve his dispute with the U.S. securities and exchanges commission, he would be in danger of being suspended from managing the company and even the prison.
In particular, the former Chairman of the Commission, Harvey Pitt, stated this to CNBC.
Musk is a "good guy who can't drive a car company."

According to the Vice Prime Minister, there are already investors willing to invest in the creation of a national team in the World's "Formula 1" race.
I know that Russia has car sports lovers, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, who are willing to invest in the establishment of a Russian team called "Formula One," he said.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like this.
I suspect that the idea of establishing a team has also arisen because of the infrastructure in Sochi.”

We are also preparing a plan of action to improve the effectiveness of Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The opening of the penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought world fame to Fleming, and made it a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the release of penicillin from mold mushrooms was not the first discovery of Fleming.
A few years earlier, when he was cold, he had sown a slip from his own nose on Petri's cup (this is such a glass lid where experiments are made with bacteria) and a few days later found that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
Almost by accident, they also found penicillin.
The name Fleming has been added to the list of 100 of the most outstanding personalities in human history.
Its discovery, according to many scholars, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine has begun to deal with most of the oldest diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene....
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote, "For the destruction of Fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions."

Trump told me about "in love" in Kim Jong Eun
The leaders of the United States and the DPRK were almost in love with each other, joking Donald Trump.
President Donald Trump of the United States was a good joke about his success in resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now corrected relations so much that they are almost in love with each other, the President of the United States noted.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had accepted from the previous Administration the North Korean problem as a major challenge in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had established such a relationship with the DPRK that it could not even reach the country's authorities -- it was not easy to take the phone off.
At the time, the United States and the DPRK were at war, and today the North Korean leader writes "pretty letters" to the White House, Trump noted.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, there was also a "frust" against Kim Chen Eun, which was mutual.
However, their relationship has now been corrected to the point that the leaders are “in love with one another”.
But Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that American media interpret them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the recent cessation of nuclear and missile testing and the closure of military zones.
All these are the merits of his administration, I'm sure the American president.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flattered Kim Jong Eun from the UN General Assembly rostrum.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and the steps taken to deescalate tensions.
Trump noted, however, that sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are being towed.
The media reported that, following the Singapore summit, the United States had already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Phenyang rejected them, calling them “Gangster”.

Nice called for the replacement of “Moscow language by Ukrainian product”
The Ukrainian child writer and advocate for the purity of Larissa Nitsoy's mother tongue called for the expulsion of “Russian-speaking Moscow and Moscow-language” from Ukraine.
To do so, she proposes a Ukrainian product - “cultural wave, cultural pressure”.
Nietsoy shared her views on “the feasibility of eradicating Russian in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian edition of the “Surveyer”.
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is even already being eaten and continues to develop.
In time, Ukrainians will “health” from this “Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said that Russian speech had previously been widely used on television and radio, but that it was virtually nonexistent in public space.
In the view of Nice, however, Ukrainians do not resort to aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian are, in her view, only “the extension of borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Nitza had previously shared her experience of maintaining a “Ukrainian-speaking regime” in a children's camp in Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened a network of Watsons bookshops, one of which had been contacted by a cashier in Russian.
When she didn't reach her goal, Nitsa threw her down.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians, she calls it "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of family names.
Nice said recently that the name "Rus" had been stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service was unable to avoid an angry writer: when she came there and heard the conversations of the staff members in Russian, she had a scandal and had left by slamming the door.

"This complicated game has been done, and there has been an interruption in a serious male conversation, and it has borne fruit: two balls have been hit and not missed.
"You missed a few matches because of the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?"
"If I've been through 90 minutes, it's okay!
Actually, I was feeling good.
Maybe at the end of the day, there's a little bit of strength to keep things from happening.
Doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatollevich Gashnev have led me to this game, for which they are so grateful!
"What do you say about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that, after winning and reviving, it's easier, and there's a good mood in the collective.
Now we have a white stripe, although it was black at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and please the fans."
"You miss the game for the time you didn't go out?"
"There's this, I miss you a little bit, because it's really a bad situation.
But again, thank you for the physical therapist and the doctors who put them on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and comforted the fans.
The rest of it is secondary."

Violations recorded in the referendum in Macedonia
Four incidents involving violations of electoral law were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, Tony Angelowski.
Since the opening of the polling stations, there had been four incidents that had been resolved, he said.

“The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can enjoy peacefully the constitutional right freely to express their will.
We call upon citizens to comply with the law and to refrain from any disturbance of public order and tranquillity and any violation of the secrecy of voting,” said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Citizens are asked during the referendum on Sunday to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?”
The referendum is intended to resolve the 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic on 17 June during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which is bordering between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the title “Republic of Northern Macedonia”.

The Pachian hopes to hold early elections to the Armenian Parliament in 2018
Elections to the Armenian Parliament could be held as early as 2018, as stated by the Prime Minister of the country, Nicole Pasinian.

But I am committed to negotiating with the parliamentary forces.
I hope they too are committed to constructive dialogue," quotes the Prime Minister of “News-Armenia”.
Nicole Paschinian added that early elections were “the demands of the people”, as well as part of the Government's agenda, which was voted upon by Parliament.

The prosecution for the Dagestan deputy became news
The Soviet District Court of Mahakkala detained, for two months, a member of the Dagestan Rajab Abdoulatipov People ' s Assembly, a suspect of participation in a criminal community who had established disability for bribes.
“Welcome” came to know the details of the investigation material, which shed light on, inter alia, the version of the Russian Investigative Committee, the younger brother of the former Head of the Republic of Ramazán, Abdulatipov Rajab Abdoulatipov, has now contributed to criminal action by the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Sciences, Magomed Mahachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, a search by the Ministry of Internal Affairs found that Rajab Abdoulatip had lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as head of the office, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles for that purpose.
We recall earlier that criminal proceedings were initiated against Magomed Mahachev, other leaders and staff of the territorial medical and social expertise offices under his supervision under article 210 (institution and participation in criminal society), article 290 (receipt of a bribe by an organized group), article 292 (individual fraud) and article 159 (in particular large-scale fraud) of the Criminal Code.
According to the results of the investigation, in late 2013, Rajab Abdoulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Mahachev and his associates involved in the theft of the Pension Fund, joined them in their activities by joining the criminal community.
As head of the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation for Dagestan and associated with State authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as taking advantage of his close relationship with the Head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdoulatipov, the investigators “considered the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with State officials to support the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his position as head of the federal executional institution, the Chief of the Medical and Social Assessment Office for the Republic of Dagestan”, organized the illegal establishment of disabilities by citizens”.
Following the announcement of the information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdoulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything I'm charged with today, it's all new to me, I'm not familiar with it," he said.
The Court arrested a deputy from the “One Russia” not for 10 days before the charge was brought, as had been the case with previous Israeli high-ranking officials, but for a period of two months, as he appeared in article 210 of the Criminal Code.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time for the investigation to be charged, up to 45 days from the time of detention.

This is what happened last Friday when several dozen special forces from Kosovo entered the area adjacent to the water-supply lake Gazivoda.
It is specified that the nuclear power plant is located in Kosovo, but it applies to the Serbian power system.
We will recall that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, but in Belgrade this fact was refused recognition.
Last spring, the parties ceased negotiations on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, the subject of Russia was practically missing in negative terms.
The Head of the Federation ' s Council for International Affairs, Constantine Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly a success for Russia and does not exclude it from becoming a turning point of view of the Russian Federation as an integral part of the solution to global world problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric we've almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been more quelled in order”, said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation had sometimes “marked as one of the three major threats to humanity, along with Ebola's fever, and, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, in any case, of a group of Western countries, which had spoken in a rather unanimous manner”.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed that “the Russian theme was practically absent in a negative way”.
"If you look closely at the statement made by the President of the United States, President of France, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I'm not taking Ukraine, Georgia or the British, at any rate, the chorus wasn't exactly accurate," he said, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall that is being trained by a tennis ball."
The Head of the Soutfed Professional Committee does not rule out this indicating a trend that he believes “will mark the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully apparent in a year, two, three”.
“I do not exclude that this session can in some sense be a turning session”, Kosachev admitted, explaining that “if there are many examples of Russia's progress in international affairs with Russia's involvement”.
He cited as an example the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“Not until this is, unfortunately, Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be used over time,” the parliamentarian added.
This is linked to what he believes is the “appropriate, healthy perception of Russia as more than just an indispensable participant in solving the global problems of our time”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we're somewhere passing a point where movement is no longer going back, it's going to be moving forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Kosachev referred to “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I have attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and I have had my own meetings, and I have seen with great pleasure that, if one year or two or five years ago, the Russian view of what is happening in the world was largely uninterested, the situation is now different,” said the Chairman of the Sofed Committee.
In his view, this was due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order, which represents the West, lacks answers to questions on how to deal with the world's problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation, migration”.
“And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming increasingly clear”, expressed Kosachev's confidence, stressing that it considers “this session to be a good one for the Russian delegation, which is good for Russia”.

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province of Idlib it will not be necessary to use military force, as stated by the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
He said that Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had an opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the withdrawal of militants of the Russian-banned Jebhat al-Nusra organization from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reporting “RIA Novosti”.
The Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of the Euphrates in the event of Kurds seeking separatism.
However, according to Muallem, negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted by the United States.
On 17 September, Putin and President Reggie Erdogan of Turkey agreed to establish, by 15 October, a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led a youth team called Chelsea.
Previously, it was reported that a 37-year-old defence lawyer was negotiating the transition to the Moscow Spartacus.
According to RT, referring to Mirror, former commander of prefabricated England John Terry led the youth team Chelsea.
According to the source, a well-known player who has served for a long time as a member of the London Club will lead the team for no more than 23 years.
It's been noted that Terry's coaching staff will replace Jody Morris who left for "Derbie County".
Recall, in September, Terry was close to the transition to the Moscow Spartacus, but he finally gave up the idea after talking to his family.
The first Vice-President of the Supreme Council, Irina Guerashenko, apologized to the accused in the Russian Federation for “spioneage” by Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushenko for his failure to release him from prison.
She said that in a video address to a political prisoner on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushenko FSB.
According to her, there was an action under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris during those days, which had been subjected to a hunger protest demanding the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them, and well-known people, are starving, supporting Oleg Senzov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and, of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interviews, wherever the President of Ukraine, Ukrainian authorities, all of us have demanded pressure on the Kremlin, pressure Putin with one demand: the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and of those children illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbasa and Crimea,” he said.
It also expressed its confidence that the trials would stab every Ukrainian, making us “wicked, stronger in the defence of the national interests of Ukraine, in the defence of each Ukrainian, in the understanding of what is good and what is evil”.
We will recall that Roman Sushenko, a correspondent of Uchrinform in France, was arrested by Russian soldiers on 30 September 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage by the General Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defence.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushenko to 12 years in a high-security colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia declared this verdict to be lawful.
The Russian prison guards granted the Ukrainian last request before being placed in a colony.
NASA reported that an asteroid the size of Big Ben was approaching Earth
NASA, an American space agency, reported that a large SP1 asteroid could reach 160 metres in length.
According to Daily Express information, a space object can exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or London field of vision.
However, no precise data are yet available on its size.
The speed at which SP1 moves is about 60,000 km/h. The lowest distance between asteroid and Earth will be on 3 October.
Then it will fly past our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first observed on 19 September.
NASA listed it as near-Earth objects.
Earlier, on 27 September, the Japanese Aerospace Research Agency published the first video ever from the surface of the Rugu asteroid.
Two Japanese Rovers (planetists) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe have been able to produce unique images.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon."
Wakhtang Kikabidze on cancer control
Many artists are now talking about how they have managed oncology.
Sadly, the disease spares no one, and the history of popular people who won cancer gives hope to many who are ill.
The famous actor Wakhtang Kikabidze admitted to living only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a sentence.
"It's like I was hit with a hammer from the bottom of my skull.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
We put it in the hospital.
The spoon couldn't hold, it couldn't stand, it fell all the time.
It's starting to do tests, and it turns out it's not working well, and the artery doesn't go through blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they said I had a big dungy cyst in my head, they had an emergency operation.
And during the surgery, the doctors saw the tumor behind the cyst," told Kikabidze on "One Day."
The tumor was malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol on the doorstep of his house.
But the actor's wife didn't allow the live actor to be buried, she believed she could handle the disease, and she didn't leave the bed for more than a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Always, when I had critical situations, she was next to me like a rock," admitted the actor.
The actor managed the disease, and now he lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumours of his sickness and the untimely death which come to pass on the Net.
The creators of the Miroca site introduced the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Sierrato, into the section “Citry”.
The reason was “a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the neighbouring country referred to “direct threats of invasion into Ukraine” and “support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine” as well as to “in the organization of provocation aimed at the massive violation by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian law”.
Note that Paul and the representative of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriots) of Onufry agreed to Cyarto in "Cristilia".
The reason was their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatya, the President of Ukraine, Peter Porosenko, demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
The authorities named the sum of the "golden parachut" of the Voronez Zamguernator
A one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of Voronez province, Yuri Aguillova, was made under the Regional Public Officers Act.
The real amount of the “gold parachut” released from office was, however, somewhat lower than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations were provided to the press service of the regional Government.
According to the law, the salary for the position of Agilova is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, in the press service, the lump sum payment was 223,892 roubles less 1 million roubles written by the media.
The official has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
His seniority in public office is over nine years.
The appointment of this pension and the lump sum payment are made immediately after his resignation and explained to RIA News in the Government of the Region.
At the same time, the payment of Agilovov ' s pension supplement has been suspended on appointment and his salary has not changed from the previous period.
The elected Governor of the region, Alexander Gussev, won the election on 15 September.
Agilova was dismissed from office because of the expiration of the term of office of the Head of the Region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, Telegram, the Netigar Canal, published documents showing that Agilovova, who had resigned from his post as Vice Governor, had paid 23 salary termination benefits and that two days after that, he had again received a similar position without the addition of a Vrio.
Statelords called on students to tell them about the harm of masturbation.
Onshenko is the first Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
On the basis of his experience, he noted in an interview that youths were being masturbated by harmful information they find on the Internet.
This is being fought at the level of educational institutions and at the family level, and the deputy added.
Gennady Onishenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station “Govatit Moscow”):
As part of the overall sexual education of children, this must be done to explain the loss, for there is a risk of a child’s sexual health, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the growth of children is early enough, and there are still large scissors between their sexual maturity and the opportunity for official contact between the sexes.
In the view of Onishenko, the problem is being addressed by “hangues”, the silence of “sexual age” and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers face the effects of self - abuse.
Deputate believes that the first thing to do is to practice lessons on the harm of self-punism in the schools of the “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we will not be understood, to say the least," said the professor.

The families of the dead in Ismailoska will be helped by the “Heatpot”
The Teploset will provide assistance to the families of the victims in breaking through the pipe on the Ismail Road.
Family members were told this by the company immediately after the tragedy.
We will recall that a blow in the yard of the house on the Ismailloe Avenue occurred on September 28.
As a result of the tragedy, several vehicles fell under the asphalt, and two young people died locally from burns.
AG became the second most popular in Germany
The Anti-Migrant "Alternativa for Germany" has another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It appears that Germans have begun to become seriously tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which has made the country a target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most recent social issues are that the German Allernativa Anti-Migrant Party is becoming more popular and the position of the ruling block Merkel and Zeehfer is getting weaker.
This week, AG broke another record by stepping up the second line of the People ' s Sympathies rating.
Right-wing conservatives with 17% popularity were able to bypass social democracies with about 16%.
The gap in one percentage point can be written off as a statistical error, but one cannot help but note the fact that the AG, created in 2013 from a small group of Euroskeptic economists, has become a major political force.
The leadership in general set-off has, for the time being, continued to retain the ruling CS/CDF block, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards losing points - as early as April, support for Angela Merkel's block was four percentage points higher.
The German chancellor's personal rating, which is headed by the Government of Germany for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
In addition, the social democracies were followed by greens (15%), leftovers (11%) and liberals (10%).
Evolution of “Alternatives”
The “Alternativa for Germany” was established in September 2012 on the basis of an “Alternative Choice 2013” group that included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The Group initially opposed the Government ' s course, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including Euro and EU cooperation.
In doing so, the group opposed Germany's “subsistance” of weak EU economies, not excluding the possibility of returning to the mark of Germany and its full withdrawal from the European Union.
With the deepening immigration crisis, the ANG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the team formed part of a full-fledged party that took up the niche of Euroseptics and began to criticize the Government severely for failing immigration policy.
At the last parliamentary election, in 2017, ANG was able to enter the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternatives for Germany" received a seat in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens “a blasphemies”
The leader of the political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of the two books of Ostap Drozdov on live air, admitted that he considered his compatriots to be “the existence of the turbans”.
They believe TV and they don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood," the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of not being patriotic and greedy.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio had begun to combat literature, which contained the slightest hints of criticism by the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the import of as many as 201 publications.
Manchester City played Brighton and joined the APL leaders.

Canadians set up a car in the event of the Apocalypse magazine driving
The car can be bought by anyone who wants to.
Rochael Definition Solutions stated that it was already accepting applications for its new armor.
Abronivoir of the Apocalypse of Roschel Senator APC
It's not just video-players, film studios and book publishing that make money on the subject of the Apocalypse.
Now the new niche is being developed by automobile companies.
For example, the Canadian Roger Defence Solutions presented its armored Apocalypse Senator APC.
The engineers of this company are creating armoured vehicles for the police in a dream free of charge.
Rosel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who, without special comfort but in full safety, are placed in a fully-carried armoured personnelupule.
This bunker, or you can't name it, because it's booked according to standard B7, is installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Douty pick-up truck.
Its head, also armoured, is capable of protecting the capsule from grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Rockel Senator APC APC armorage
To prevent passengers from even being affected by an explosive wave from breaking up near a car projectile, the car is equipped with special shock chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
For safe vision, a motor vehicle, Rosel Senator APC, is equipped with a round-clock vision system with night vision as well as an armoured view tower on the roof.
There's no gun in the car.
Front of the Apricot Apocalypse Losel Senator APC
To ensure that the weight of the armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility, Rosel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbodies engine of 6.7 litres, the whole of which is transmitted to four wheels of the armor by means of a 6-step automatic gearbox.
There's no chance of getting caught up in Rochel Senator APC's armory.
You can see Rosel Senator APC's armory at a special exhibition in Washington, D.C., in October.
The term of death of the universe
The universe lasts about 140 billion years, 10 times the age of the observed world, which is about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists is published in the library of electronic preprinters arXiv.org and is published in the magazine Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts have come to this conclusion by observing, with the help of HSC’s camera Superme-Cam, the Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
After tracking the distribution of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, which accounted for more than 95 per cent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model of the CCDM ("Cold Dark Matter"), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
The press release of the Subaru Observatory noted that observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, while recording the data of the Planck European Space Telescope clarified the limitations imposed on the .CDM parameters.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments for the observed world to cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Divide.
There has been a failure of the regular attempt to unify the initiators of the pension referendum
The ability to learn people's views on pension reform is delayed indefinitely
Moscow held a meeting on Saturday of the federal initiative group of the referendum against the promotion of retirement age.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different language of the questions (five were registered by the Centre for Collection).
They decided to apply to the CEC for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians, "Do you wish to ensure that the age of old-age pension for Russian citizens as of 1 July 2018 does not increase?"
The wording was registered by a Voloda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the congregation, but it was considered to be the simplest and legal weight.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of Ilya Sviridov, a member of the Fair Russia (six subgroups) and CPRF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronage and Orenburg, joined them.
Sviridov used to say “Kids” that invitations had been sent to all initiators and that representatives of some 40 subgroups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenov, the leader of the Voloda subgroup (which was supported by another 15 subgroups), said that the invitations were not received and did not plan to come: "We didn't understand who the friend is and who the enemy is."
Otis Rush, a blue singer, died
At the age of 84, Otis Rush, a well-known blue guitarist and singer, died with reference to his manager, Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following the 2003 stroke.
Mr. Rash's creation had an impact on musicians like Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.
He was well-known in 1956 after the release of the song "I Can't Quit You Baby", which took the sixth line of the Billboard R&B rating.
"Admiral" has created big problems for us
Zinetula Belleletdinov: "Admiral" has created big problems for us.
Chief coach, Aq Barsa, Zeinethula Bilaletdin, summarized the regular CK championship match against Admiral (4:2).
"A hard game was complicated.
The rival fought with dignity, created big problems for us.
I'm glad we played pretty well today, most of them.
I've already told you that one day the bares will come, and it's all about us working on it.
And that we won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zarip a break in this series?"
"We have our own program for which he works.
That's why this was the decision," he says.
Ilon Musk will leave the post of Chief of the Tesla Board of Directors
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk would have to resign from the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the position of executive director of the company, reports AFP with reference to the regulator ' s data.
Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Previously, the regulator filed a claim against Ilon Mack - officials believed that he had misled the Tesla investors, since the businessman had allowed the purchase of all the shares of the company at a high price of $420 per paper.
In Loko's "Ahmat" match, Turbin's mistakes were like a horn full of plenty.
Former All Union Judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of arbitrator Eugenius Turbin in the 9th Tour of the Russian Locomotive Championship, Ahmat, and dealt with the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate Evgenia Turbin's trial at Locomotive-Ahmat?
- I believe this arbitrator has confirmed that he is not fit to be tried by a Russian premier League match.
I'm surprised that the compromise at Spartacus 5th Tour, the Dinamo, neither Turbin himself nor the DSI leaders have come to serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result was no delay in the ninth round: errors in his actions, and private blanks of harsh receptions were piled up like horns of plenty.
For example, for the 50th minute of Eder's railways, he's putting his hands in his punishment area for the "Ahmat" of Rodolfo.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put any toolbar on it.
- How do you rate the episode involving Ida, who was in the 82nd minute when it appeared that the ball was in his hand?
- I think there was a deliberate game here by the hand of a defender in his penal square.
Turbin was right next to the moment, well-seeing the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment was to be seen by Judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three were asleep, and the toolbar was not assigned.
The score in the match has therefore been distorted, and sports justice has been damaged.
This was the very case where the judicial process was supposed to have pushed out and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
At 52 minutes, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's lawyer, who broke the rules in the fight against Krykhovak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he gave him a demonstrative applause.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have shown you the second mustard?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card didn't exactly show up.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of justice, that some teams have been pitched for violations such as the Ida episode and none.
What do you appreciate about the football player's words?
- That's what double standards mean.
There was a toolbar.
They didn't.
So, the arbitrator won't let the second toolbar in the opposite gate.
That's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge looks who's playing.
There's a Saturday Locomotive and Ahmad has a serious claim to the work of Turbin because the team was disabled.
Matt Damon played the rape accused Judge Cavanaugh at the SNL launch.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first edition of the new season of the Sunday Night Live on the NBC TV channel.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavanano at the Senate hearing on charges of rape.
The candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotions and details during his interview with Senator Amy Clobuchar.
For example, Cavanaugh repeatedly admitted to his love for beer, but said that he had never been drunk before.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavano claimed that he was a virgin during those years.
Damon also played these points.
All I did was make a lot of drink and I didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin I've ever seen.
Everyone knows it," the judge said in the execution of Matt Damon.
Cavanaugh was previously elected U.S. supreme judge.
Barbra Streizand discovered strange behavior from his cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streizand claimed that the clones of her dead dog were quite different from the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
"It is true that [the clones] look like it, but it is impossible to clone a soul," stressed a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Straysand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old dog, the koton detulear named Samantha, who had to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, who was called the world's smallest dog, was cloned 49 times.
Experts are working on the cloning of a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so small.
U.S.A. thought about the Russian sea blockade due to oil and gas supplies
In the U.S. a sea blockade may be imposed on Russia in order to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The American authorities are so busy fighting for success in the world hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the Russian maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
Ryan Zinke, head of the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs, described the possibility of a naval blockade the previous day.
Contrary to global practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior does civilian functions rather than police, including natural resources policies.
So Zinke's statement came within the competence of his department, although it was not devoid of political prominence.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that, thanks to the U.S. naval force, maritime routes in the Middle East region were controlled and could be blocked if necessary.
Zinke's words suggested that the need might be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a large share of its revenues from the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motivation for the revitalization of Moscow in the region, Zinke is confident.
The Minister made it clear that the US continues to look forward to global energy market leadership, becoming the largest oil and gas supplier.
For this to happen, Washington will have to make Russia and Iran sick, and the maritime blockade on trade routes is an acceptable measure on this road, Zinke believes.
The Kalmitz director received good feedback from the festival
Our countryman, actor Eugenius Sangageev's "Gogoll Center" and his film "Harmony" are specifically mentioned by members of the jury of the sixth debut festival "The Movement" held in Omsk.
The festival diploma specifically states that “this is a signal for the immediate response of the major industrial players of the spectators”.
As is well known, a picture of a young Colombian director was presented in a short film program called "The Movement: The Beginning", where eight films participated.

There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former captain of Chelsea and congrudent England, John Terry, about why he went to the ninth round of the Spartacus, Spartacus.
"I've got a club in Russia that I'm watching.
I've been watching lately and I was curious to see him from the outside.
I can't say I'm a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus, and I want to apologize again for the decision,” says Terry's Chelsea website.
Remember, the 18-point "Roost" rose to third place in the tournament table, and the Spartacus was placed on the fifth line, with 15 points in the asset.
The next round of red and white, on 7 October, will play with Enisey, and the Trusted Valery Carpina will be adopted by Orenburg a day earlier.
The expensive violin was placed in the Lombard for a priceless price.
When a man in Somerville, Massachusetts, brought a violin for a seemingly old and unreasonable instrument to the Lobbard Loan.
But the experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and he sought advice from an expert.
It turns out that the violin was made by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinand Galiano in 1759 and is estimated at $250,000.
The violin fiddles alone are estimated to be between $16,000 and $18,000.
The investigation found that the violin had recently been stolen from a resident of the city, and the instrument was returned to the legitimate owner.
It is not yet known how the violin came to the person who put it in the Lombard, but there are no previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now all who bring the violin to the logo will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the customer.
In the ninth round of the RPF, we are faced with an exciting confrontation: Spartacus will take us to its "Rosto" stadium in Tusin under the leadership of Valery Karpin, a human being, as we know, not a foreign "people's team".
A special highlight of this meeting is that the clubs now have an equal number of 15 points, and they divide 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, leaving behind the far-reaching Zenita and standing in the same spot as the "Grannodar" that plays with "Dinamo" tomorrow.
Red and white now have a hard lane: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly flew into the Rapidou, and recently left the Akhmatu houses.
Following a derby with a fair nobody, Spartacus played the Black Sea Cup with a minimum score, and it is not easy to talk about whether Russia's most popular club is nearing its exit from the crisis.
"Rost" three games in a row couldn't win, but he doesn't know five games anymore.
Let's see if Carpina can continue this win-win series with such a game of principle.
The previous meeting with Spartacus in Karpinov concluded in favour of the capital team.
Start at 7 p.m.

London has been accused of Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, said British Defence Minister Gavin Williamson.
But England would defend its values, and he stressed it when he spoke at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threat is increasing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, and enemies are operating in gray zones with cyberattacks and false news, the Minister added.
But the largest is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians in Moscow have repeatedly been rebutted and transmitted by the TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunte, reported that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not comply with international regulations and use chemical weapons.
Hunt referred to a story of poisoning in the English city of Solsbury last March by ex-crete Colonel Sergei Scrippal, convicted of espionage in favor of the British, and his daughter, Julia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum is being held for accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change of country name.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighbouring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a hot supporter of the name of the Republic to Northern Macedonia.
International organizations are monitoring preparations for the referendum and today ' s vote.
Jan Petersen, head of the monitoring mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, told Euronews about the organization of the work of the observers:
Approximately 100 teams traveled around the country to observe the entire process today, from the opening of the polling stations to their closure, then the counting of votes and the drafting of records.
For a month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, monitoring preparations for voting, media work, compliance with the Law on the Financing of Electoral Campaigns and the organization of a referendum.
Fei Dulgeri: “About 500 foreign observers are closely following the voting.
The observer teams shall record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the electoral commissions in order to present them in the final report.”

The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a major role in understanding.
This was the case on International Translator Day, 30 September, with a professional interpreter, Berbel Sackse.
It has been working in Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events calmly, and the Russians, as the saying goes, "they're gonna be slow and they're going fast."
But I don't think it's important for understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter," said the expert in the commentary "RIA News."
According to the interpreter, to understand that the two countries should not be without each other, “there is enough history to know”.
And in the future, Sacksa noted, Germany has no point in ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, and there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there's a lot of things that determine our common destiny," she said.
The day before, German chancellor Angel Merkel stated that the country was trying to “link up” with and maintain Russia.
According to her, Berlin Mania was particularly important for the Northern Flow 2 gas pipeline project, which was built from the Russian coast to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

At the time of publication, the Russians had donated 1,633 rubles to Vera Ganza.

"Golden sink" The San Sebastijan Festival received the film "Beat of the Two Seas"
The painting of the "Entre dos aguas" by Spanish director Isaac LaQueesta was recognized as the best film of the 66th International Film Festival in San Sebastián.
Lenta was awarded the main award for the Festival of Gold Creams.
The Norwegian actress Pia Tielta received the award of "Silver sink" as the best actress for "Blind Spot" tape.
The best actor was named the Argentine Dario Grandinetti for the film "The Red" (Rojo).
The director of the same film, Benjamin Night State, won the title of the best director.
"The Night School" was headed by American boxing officers.
A comedy called "The Night School," debuted in American cinemas last Friday, earned $28 million for her first weekend in rental.
This result allowed the mindless picture of Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the U.S. Boxing Office from 28 to 30 September.
On the international market, so far only 20 countries have collected $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line, Malcolm Lee's work, which was remarkable enough to outpace another Western protégé, the "Smolfut" cartoon, is an interesting story of the familiarity of an enthronement with a human being whose existence the main hero never believed in.
The project of directors, Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reeseg, collected $23 million for their start-up weekend, generally meeting the expectations of experts predicting 20-25 million for the weekend.
With regard to Smolfuta's total charges, they currently amount to $38.6 million (with a debut already in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active in this area, adding 3.6 million to the film's treasury.
The three strongest children's story "The Secret of the House With Clocks" is locked up by the master of the horrors of Ela Roth, who has proved definitively that the director is capable of making quality films and 12+ for the audience.
During her second week, John Bellers, with charming Jack Black and Kate Blancett, was screened with $12.5 million, bringing the total world fees to $53.8 million.
Despite the top-3 flight, it continues to be a surprise with the sign "+" of Blake Liveley and Anna Kendrick "Please": 17 days in the U.S. rolling painting of Paul Fig, from which some unrealistic financial achievements were not originally expected by the word "all", raised $43 million (including 6.6 million for 28-30 October) and now has as much as 62.9 million total revenue.
The last representative of the first five this week was the Horror of the "Claim of Monarchs", who collected $5.4 million during the reporting period.
The back-off of Zakatia, after 24 days in the United States (and not only of course) cinemas, has $330 million in total earnings and has recently been proud of the most successful franchise film, which also includes two parts of the Zaklaka itself and two tapes about Annabel's Beast doll.
Following the horrors of Corin Hardy, the last weekend was followed by another member of the genie, the Hellefest debutant, who was one of the main youth choreographers of the year.
In her first weekend, Gregory Plottkin, a well-known children's builder (and recently director) who had been working on a number of major projects, including "Happy Day of Death", where Hallefest was very similar, had earned $5.1 million in U.S. revenue in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh was "The Unrich Asians" ($4.15 million), which does not seem to be expected to fall out of top 10 of the American boxing office: a romantic comedy that has been on screen for the seventh week, as a result of September, is the sixth in the list of the genie's most cashier tapes in history, with a record of 165.7 million.
This is the sum of the picture that has so far been earned on the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.
With regard to the last three lucky men who fell into the 10th U.S. harvests of 28-30 September, they became Predator, White Rick and... "Bagra minta", who earned $3.7 million, 2.38 million and 1.1 million for the past weekend, respectively.
In addition, on the next weekend in the United States, we'll gather the long-awaited "Ven" with Tom Hardy, who -- we can be sure -- will, without any difficulty, take over the leadership of the American Boxing Office as a result of the first weekend of October.
Of the other pre-eminent week to come, it is worth highlighting a musical melodrama called "Starda Was Born," a Venice film festival laureate from Bradley Cooper, and a criminal drama called "Your Hate."

Valery Belov: The Lord helped Siberia today.
Chief Co-Teamer Valery Belov, on the impact of Siberia (3:4) in the regular CKK championship match.
"The collega spoke of Siberian fans," and I want to mention our fans," says the words of the White Official Web site "Vision."
"I hope they'll be supportive, too, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
According to the game, perhaps the Lord helped Siberia today because he was very grossly wrong, especially our leaders.
We lost the micro game, match 0:3 for our leading leaders, so it was hard for us to get this match out, even though there were moments.
But I'll do it anyway.
Because I must have missed something in preparation.
It was a different team than the previous match."
"It's a kind of roach."
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice at the Voice show.
The viewers of Voice 60+ accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "unlike grotesqueness and imperceptibility."
When he heard his father’s voice from his first note, Nicholas Agutina, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the perpetrator.
But his son’s feelings took over, and he chose a relative as his team.
At that time, many viewed it as a joke, but they excused the instructor’s bias in the first stage.
But the "shock" has been prolonged, and the father of the star has taken the place of the more worthy performers in absolute disrepute.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutina for this injustice.
Yesterday, we viewers of the show were outraged by the barrage of unseemly and frankly pulling our close relatives into the final staircase.
I've even doubted Agutina's strength and conscience to stop bringing his dad to the very first place," said Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin in "The TV Man."
In the meantime, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "saw" the great performers who were really singing, while Nicholas Petrović whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wanted to see his father on the show.
But it turns out that it's not true that viewers want an objective assessment and see really talented performers in the finals, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I'm sorry for the Voices from Agutin's team, they were doomed."
"The last time Agutin showed how much he loved his dad, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and to leave in the project his dad, who's not singing but whispering, what can you then call a mentor?"
"I like the way Dad sings, organize a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people come to this concert."
It's a Voice show, not a Cool Relatives show.
"It wasn't professional on the Agutin side."
"Then we have to offer Dad on our own show, not on the show that's made for 1 Channel."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took a place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real ocular data.
Why did a working man from Surguth with a great voice and a timbre pour out, and Pope Agutin was brought to the finale?
And then we all complain that on stage and from screens the same faces for decades!
Indeed, you will not be able to break through it.’
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
Blah and cuisine all around.
The family budget will not be too much!
The theatre is still absurd!"
The users also remembered that Gradsky's son had come out on blind listening in one of the seasons of the traditional Voices.
At that time, three feet, and I didn't think of taking my son to my own team.
He said, "Come on, get out of here, understand everything."
Agutin couldn't act as a professional.
The Canadian military was allowed to wear beards to raise the spirits
The Canadian Ministry of Defence issued an order allowing soldiers to wear beards.
According to the CBC television channel, the bill contains instructions on beard care.

The beard of the military cannot be longer than 2 cm, it must also be carefully trimmed, and the neck and cheek must be shaved out.
At the same time, the fleet officers were allowed to wear a beard only on land.
It is expected that the introduction will “enforce morale in the army and attract more Canadians”.
The ban on wearing beards has been in force in the Canadian army since World War II.
Previously, it had been reported that police officers in France had also been allowed to wear beards and even to have tattoos.
At the same time, the Egyptian court supported the removal of bearded policemen.

The innovation will help those who decide to buy an apartment in the building but are afraid of the builder’s bankruptcy.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
As a result of the amendments to the law on equity construction, developers will have to lend themselves entirely to the bank.
And many experts have already talked about the possible heavy travel of apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.
In downtown Kiev, the robber threatened the man with a knife, forcing him to take the money off the ATM.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 September at Ivan Kudri Street, where the capital law enforcement officers reported.
According to the victim, an unknown man approached him and started a conversation, but then he suddenly grabbed a knife and demanded that the money and his cell phone be given him.
Since the victim did not have cash, the stranger ordered that the money be taken from the bank card.
After the attacker received 4,000 hryvnias and telephones, he hit the victim and fled,” the report says.
Law enforcement officers were able to arrest the robber and found themselves 25 years old.
He now faces up to seven years of imprisonment.
The police are also working on a version of the perpetrator ' s involvement in other such crimes.
Recall that the previous day in Odessa, there were several resonant raids by the incinerators.
In one case, armed robbers were caught using a drone.
The scientist described a possible scientific programme for the RF to the Moon
The head of the Institute for Space Research of the Ranne, correspondent member of the Ran Anatoly Petruković, told RIA Novoty about a possible programme of scientific research for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was now working on the direction of such work.
"A consolidated view is not yet," stressed the scientist.
He noted that one option was to place a low frequency radio telescope on the other side of the Moon, which would avoid interference with the Earth.
"It's the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," added Petruković.
He also believes that the Moon could be used for testing robotics, using local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be called upon to search for primitive organics on Earth’s satellite, a scientist says.
This could help determine how life is coming about on the planets.
Formerly, the head of Roscosmos said that, in the optimistic version of the Russian Federation, a manned flight to the Moon could take place by 2030.
An offended client dropped out a basket of fecals in a 7-Eleven store.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), called having a tooth on a 7-Eleven network store manager, put him out of the store in May for misconduct.
And he decided to avenge his enemy in the original way.
On the afternoon of the second night, he went into the store and dropped it on the floor and some of the goods on the shelf containing the contents of the basket.
The basket was filled with feces and urine, which Simms “borrowed” from a nearby mobile biotoulet.
Police officers who arrived at the scene arrested a “vengeful”.
He was put in prison and released on bail at $300.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of property and criminal offences and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms' crime seems more ridiculous than serious, the court's sentence may be quite harsh, as he has repeatedly violated the law: large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, driving in a state of ill-treatment and abuse of animals.
In the United States, they named Russia’s most formidable submarine.
The most formidable enemy submarine for the U.S. Navy will be the Russian subterranean Kazan Project "January-M," writes The National Interest.
The submarine was launched in March 2017, but the Navy will have it in 2019.
According to the publication, even the predecessor of Kazani, Severodwinsk, was commended by the U.S. military.
We will face a severe potential enemy.
Just look at Severodwinsk, cited The National Interest Counter-Admiral Dave Johnson.
However, the publication states that the United States retains its advantage over Russia in this industry.
The multi-purpose nuclear submarines “Kazan”, “Novosibirsk”, “Krasnoyarsk” and “Archangelsk” are built on an improved project “Jan-M” (885M).
They have 13,800 tons of water displacement, 520 metres of water, 64 crews, 100 days of self-sustainment, and 31 knots of underwater speed.
Submarine is armed with mines, torpedo 533 mm, Oneix and Caliber cruise missiles.
In August, the U.S. Navy 6 press service stated that the U.S. submarine force remained “the most powerful and frightening on the planet”.

Two teams met before the meeting had two hits.
Let's go "on our teeth."
I played the special band by throwing down two pucks.
It's obvious that the kids have a very heavy psychological load.
They're very hurrying to end the attacks, so they're not working.

At the time of crossing the Ukrainian-Russian border, he removed the fair license plates, but he re-established them at the time of entry into Kiev.
He said that he had done so “in order to ensure that registration vehicle numbers of the package conformed to the vehicle in question issued by the Russian representatives of INTERPOL in case the vehicle was stopped for inspection by Ukrainian police”.
“A set of measures is currently under way to verify the explanations provided and to establish its possible involvement in terrorist activities”, stated the ISS.
In Ukraine, it is prohibited to use numbers issued by terrorists in the areas they have seized.
In fact, an official of the State Border Service had been seen on a car with similar numbers in Mariupola earlier.

In the United States, a possible maritime blockade was declared by the Russian Federation
The United States can, if necessary, impose a maritime blockade on Russia in order to prevent its supply of energy to the countries of the Middle East.
This was stated by Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of the Interior.
Speaking at an industrial event in the United States city of Pittsburgh, the head of department stated that for the Russian economy, the only source of income was the sale of energy and Moscow was actively pursuing oil and gas sales in the Middle East, as it did in Europe, writes Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that this was the case with Iran.
In the view of the Minister, there are two options for its solution: the military and the economic.
He would prefer not to use the first, so it was necessary to exert pressure and to replace Iranian energy resources.

I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
Sergey Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
The Russian pilot Williams, Sergey Sirotkin, commented on the outcome of the Grand Primitive race.
I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I ended up between two cars that hit me right away.
I've lost all the positions I've played at the start, for a moment, right away.
Turned into a very bad position.
I'm stuck in traffic.
It was hoped that after the rest of us got to the pit stop, we would get into the clean air, and the pace would come back, but the rubber was gone.
Plus had a fight with his partner, too.
I understand he was a little wrong.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most unremitting track of the season, I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Sirotkin RIA's words "News."
Recall that Sirotkin, in a race on the Grand Primor of Russia, was finished on the 18th, and the British pilot "Mersedes" Lewis Hamilton became the winner.
Tarpisev described as absurd the removal of Gushukov and Pszcenko from Spartacus' foundation.
The President of the Federation of Tennis of the Russian Federation (FTR), Shamel Tarpšchev, commented on the removal of Moscow Spartacus football players, Denises Gluchakova and Andrei Pscenko, from training with major members after a speech to criticize the main coach of Massimo Carrera, reports Sport Weekend.
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
Such things to pay attention to are stupid.
I completely disagree with what Carrera does.
It only deepens the division of the team.
First, it's poems, and you can read them and take them for granted.
I wouldn't have reacted to this if I were Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to go for fun.
If Szczelukov and Pzczczczemko are slamming, it doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks flexibility in his perception of the situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal climate on the team.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so the situation didn't have to be crushed at all.
Maybe I should have laughed about it together.
Spartacus has a lot of problems on different lines, and there's an incompetence when it's introduced into young people.
The relationship within the team does not seem to add optimism to this match," Tarpishchev is certain.
The two teams will be held on 30 September and will start at 1900 Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously refused Spartacus, led a youth team called Chelsea.
Syriusa educators discussed natural technology with scientists
Teachers of the Syrius Educational Centre in Sochi, participants in the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the National Research Centre of the Curchatow Institute.
The presentation of the researchers took place as part of the programme of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Environmentally Similar Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, on 29 September, on the website of the educational centre.
The lecture opened a documentary film entitled “Kody Kurchatovov”, during which the President of the Kurchatow Institute, a correspondent member of the Ran Mikhail Kowalchuk, described the global challenges as the driving force of civilization.
The scientist's lecture is published on Sirius.
School students have learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such quantities.
The environmental technologies that young scientists are working on today will help to solve this problem, according to the forum organizers.
In addition, Kowalczuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of environmental technologies and also described the risks inherent in the development of such technologies.
"The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a tremendous good.
It's an explosive growth in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of natural technologies is, in fact, the technological reproduction of living systems.
There's a turning side -- targeted intervention in human life.
There's always risks.
The car came -- people were dying under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology is immediate.
I'm creating a new medical technology, and I can build weapons of mass destruction," quoted a scientist named Ren TV.
After watching the film and discussing current scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions from the meeting.
The speakers were the Physico-Mathematics candidate, the head of the Kurchatow NBICS-Natural Technology Project of NIC Curchatov Institute, Julia Djakova, and the head of the Kurchatow NBICS-Technology Kurchatov complex of Vyacheslav Demin.
The Syrius Educational Centre in Sochi was established by the Talant and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure, at the initiative of President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
The purpose of the education centre is to identify, develop and further provide professional support to gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that all-Russian online-Olympiad for information security, Cyberviso, would be sent to Sirius for training.
Air traffic controller saved a plane with passengers during an earthquake in Indonesia

Macedonia: referendum was not held due to low appearance
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country as “North Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the use by the Macedonians of the name of their historic province.
The change of name has led the former Yugoslav Republic of Korea to open the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the EFE, only 34 per cent of "not reach" on Sunday's plebiscite to a constitutional threshold of 50 per cent.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje might decide not to refuse to change their name.

Kemerachants Disguised the flock of rams in the cemetery
On 30 September, a report appeared on the social network of a well-known Kemeros page that cattle were walking freely on one of the local cemeterys.
The animals of a large herd walked between the fences and dug the grass.
The commentators expressed differing views: some of the local residents noted that in the presence of small cattle at the cemetery, there was no harm and their appetite could even help clear the area from weeds and grasses, but some of the inhabitants of the city did not have to take pleasure in the behaviour of the animals:
"It's a graveyard, not a pasture.
There's nothing to be done for the rams.
Of the rams, of course you will not say that they are a coward, but it is not a matter."
In one way or another, one of the eyewitnesses said that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery was already known, and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
- What's the right thing to do?
There's no word of pressure.
That's right.
The word "long" in the meaning of "longness, influence, influence" only exists phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "reason".
We use that word in the belief that it comes from the word pressure.
But the pressure and the "satisfactory" are not only close, but even in some sense the opposite.
See for yourself.
To owe (church-book, outdated) means "suffer enough, enough, enough for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
Enjoy, enjoy, family words.
Previously, he still had the meaning of “not dependent on anything to be self-satisfied” — “to be satisfied”.
The ancient Slavic word "loyal" is similar to the word "lord" and "voluntary."
Pushing, suppressing is quite different.
These words are truly frightening “descendants”: daos - “volk”, deyja - “destroy” and dvaidā - “reserve”.
The similar phonetic nature of the words “pression” and “reap”, as well as the imminent ageing of the latter, caused them to enter the mine.
So we have this very "d[a]volt" that is also used in writing through "a", which is, in a good way, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of those words.
So, right, let's do it.
But the word is outdated, in its correct meaning no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative effect on you from above, use the word “press”.
You can also use pressure construction, but remember, it's an office.

But the behavior of our car has been the best since the beginning of the weekend."
"In the course of your qualifications, you didn't step in at Sebastian Fettel's speed, but eventually the backlog was visible.
What's the reason?"
"My attempt was a good one, but then there was one of the Mercedes racers.
He was getting ready for the attempt and still managed to miss me, but I think I lost it for a while.
But it doesn't really have a big impact on the outcome."
"In Sochi, it's very hard to get past the race, it's going to be a key moment?"
"Maybe, yes, but you never know how it's going to work.
It's not going to be easy anyway, because our car is much slower than Mercedes."

A friendly person gave the baby an exclusive parking lot — a magazine driving
Miracles do happen in our lives!
One of them was told by a German journalist, Christie Ditz, on Twitter.
She wrote on her page that her four-year-old son had been parking his bobel (a child’s bicycle without pallets) around the same lamppost throughout the year.
And one morning, a nice green bike sticker came up on the column and said, "Only for him."
There was no limit to mom and baby's admiration.
Christie thanked the anonymous kindly and commended him for his interesting and fresh idea.
She tweeted quickly on social media and made many people smile.
The comments to it were also remarkable:
"How wonderful!"
"Thanks for the wonderful association in this world."
"I think there's a lot of people in the world who can do this."
"Unfortunately, they don't attract the same attention as the outcasts."
"This is the world we need!"
The readers asked the journalist if she could find out who the author of the idea was.
This man seems to be somewhere near him. He's been watching the kid park since it came to his mind.

This is reported by the Ural Meridian.

Vučić maintained the highest level of readiness of the Serbian army
The President of Serbia, Alexander Vučić, has ordered that the highest level of readiness to which the armed forces of the country have been deployed be maintained owing to the situation in the north of the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija.
“The President has ordered the maintenance of the highest level of preparedness, and a separate order will be removed”, said the Serbian Minister of Defence, Alexander Voulin, quoted by the TASS, on Sunday.
He said that the Head of State was deeply concerned about developments in Kosovo.
However, Vulin boasted, the President of the Republic expressed “satisfaction with the energy, labour, readiness and speed of the military Serbia”.
Vučić himself stated the previous day that he intended to discuss the situation in Kosovo and Metohija with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and to ask the Russian leader for support.
It is reported that the meeting is scheduled for 2 October and should take place in Moscow.
At the same time, the Serbian leader stressed that he would do everything to preserve peace and said that he wished his country to be a peaceful, economically successful country for the future.

In Germany, 14,000 people demonstrated against racism
Some 14,000 people went to a demonstration against racism in the German city of Hamburg.
The action was supported by more than 450 organizations under the slogan “Abstinence against racism”.
The organizers initially reported that some 30,000 demonstrators would take part in the actions, calling on the authorities to refuse to deport migrants from the country and to defend the right of people to protection and asylum, says Zeit.
The event also stated that the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean should cease to be an offence.
In addition, the demonstrators demanded the resignation of Horst Zeehfer, head of the Ministry of the Interior, and the dissolution of the institution for the protection of the Constitution.
A member of the action, Nevros Duman, stated that the purpose of the demonstration was to demonstrate the unity of society and solidarity on the issue.
Refugees and migrants should not be treated as different, and migration itself should be the mother of that society.
Many migrant communities and anti-racist organizations have sent an open letter to the Minister requesting resignation.
Russia has shielded itself from terrorists by means of an operation in Syria
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 had been destroyed by the Aerospace and Space Forces of the Russian Federation.
This was described on the occasion of the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the FAC, Victor Bondarev, head of the Federation Defence and Security Council Committee.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-to-air means of impact: the Aerospace Forces had and were continuing to strike precisely at terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist targets have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition warehouses, reinforcements and headquarters.
Russian air strikes were used to hack the Jihadists' defenses, making a decisive contribution to the progress of the Syrian Government's troops, transmitting Interfax.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, our military operation in Syria has allowed Russia itself to be shielded from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the “Islamic State” (IG prohibited in Russia) and the “Jabhat en Nousru” (prohibited in Russia).
According to Genstab of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, some 4,000 Russian militants and about 5,000 citizens of post-Soviet countries were fighting on the IG side, passing over the TASS.
And it's only a registered person, except for those who were not identified, that Bondaev stressed.
Most of them have been trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports have given them the right to enter freely into our country.
Thus, said Bondarev, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on the long-range - otherwise this evil would “be upon us”.

We are investigating the causes of the malfunction and apologizing for any problems caused,” stated the Conservative Party.
During the crash, users could not only see confidential data but also edit information in the profiles of politicians and journalists.
For example, Michael Gowa, Minister of Environment, Environment and Agriculture, replaced his photograph with a picture of the mediamagnate Rupert Merdok.
Syria accused the United States of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Mualham, accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and of supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian town of Raqa, destroyed the infrastructure and public services in the areas targeted, and committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes,” he said.
According to Mualham, the United States and its partners have provided “direct support to the terrorists”, as the targets of the militants and the Western Coalition in Syria coincided and implied “the sowing of chaos, death and destruction in their path”.
The Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria had almost been completed and the country had become safer and more stable.
Mualem added that Damascus also intended to rid Syria of an illegal foreign presence and that priority would be given to Syrian partners in rebuilding the country.
In September, the head of the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Hosting Parties in the Republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, stated that two American F-15 aircraft had attacked the Syrian province of Deir al-Zor with prohibited phosphorous munitions.
The United States rejected all charges.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Porozenko, believes that, in respect of the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
This was stated by the Head of State during his visit to the Kharkiv region, commenting on Hungary ' s issuance of its passports to Zakarpatya.
Protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” said Prossenko.
As President, he said, he would protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they were, east or west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a passport scandal with Hungary, which was intended to expel the Consul of the country from Beregovo.
"I fully share every letter that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says," said the President.
On 19 September, a video showing the time of issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in the Hungarian Consulate in Beregovo was published on the Internet.
In doing so, they made an oath of allegiance to Hungary out loud.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Paul Klimkin, noted that the consul of Hungary, which appeared on video giving Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself or be expelled by Kiev.
It was also reported that the Zakarpatsk State Prosecutor ' s Office had initiated criminal proceedings for the issuance of Hungarian passports.
The incident is classified as “State treason”.

In addition to Tuva, the Republic is one of the President ' s favorite places of recreation.
More than 10 million Syrians have been refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict in Syria for seven years.
Some five million people fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Damascus now believes that the hostilities are nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
The Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Al-Mualem, said this to the United Nations: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure as a result of the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government is continuing its reconstruction efforts in the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions had been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which had made life and livelihood difficult.
The Syrian authorities also called on the world community to facilitate and provide funding for the return of refugees.
In the meantime, the United States and the countries of the European Union refuse to provide assistance to Syria, stating that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.

In December of last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the company’s managers, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
Market losses are estimated at at least 25 billion euros.

For example, the management of the firm has recently changed again and a major restructuring and policy changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy out even new cars if German cities forbid diesels on their streets: this right was granted to the authorities in February this year.

Mitropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename UPC to Fascist actions
The head of the Russian Orthodox Church's Division for External Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mitropolitan Ilarion, compared the designation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Fascists against Jews.
“It's like in German Fascist Germany to put a yellow vertice star on a Jew, which means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it's for this purpose that this bill was created,” stated a mitropolitan on the TV channel Russia 24 (Interfax Cit).
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainen conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UCP and to “outlaw it” the clergyman believes.
"It's a Ukrainian church, and the believers in that church think they're Ukrainians, they're patriots of their country," he added.
It has been reported earlier that members of the Supreme Council are working on the implementation of Bills Nos. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the change of the name of the SCP of the Moscow patriarchate.
The Deputy of Pochaevsky Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Mitropolitan Vladimir, Deputy of the Saint-Uspen Pochaev laura, called for the protection of Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UCC) was published on Saturday on the website.
At various times in history, our predecessors and relatives in faith and spirit had to exercise their faith and defend their holy places.
Given the situation and the information we have and the threats of the massacres that are spreading, it is clear that we too will have to survive," the mitropolitan stated.
He asked for support - prayeral, moral.
Also, the incumbent of the laurel stressed that “your physical presence is likely to be needed”.
The priest said, "Lenin's grandsons are by spirit, and they threaten to kill us, and then we defend our sanctuary."
Those who care about the fate of the Pochaevian laurel, an Orthodox sanctuary in Ukraine and a universal sanctuary, should be prepared to protect it, says the address.
Mithropolitus urged against those who mislead the believers.
The UCP has the canonical status defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to make it dependent on the news patriarch and friend of the Catholic pope of Roman Bartholomew.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we're pleased with the status our church has," the deputy of the laurel.
He recalled that the UCP had been Canonically independent and fully independent in its administration since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos is already our church.
"What else do we need?" said Mitropolitan Pochaevsky Vladimir, urging the believers and all citizens to ask themselves, "Do other Tomos religions have any other faiths, are they independent of the Vatican?
The believers had some insight into and determined what kind of temple they were going to go to.
But someone wants to sow hatred and strife again.
Some become jealous that they shine the domes on the temples they want to destroy,” the priest said.
It is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
A laurel is located at the top of the Mount of Pochaev, 70 kilometres from Ternopol.
The first historical record of it dates back to the early 13th century.

"It was a good game, interesting though it was going to the ground," Vorobiev said as an official website, "The Carlobilist."
"I tried to play very easily.
The first period was very good.
We didn't use some good points.
During the second period, the rival gave us some cremation, and we endured.
But we've been fed a little bit.
They played great, they did coaching.
I think if we continue to play the right game, we'll win.
They didn't win the game, they didn't win the game's heads, but the content of the game was the right one.
Good luck will come if we continue to play in this direction.”
"In your opinion, "The motorist added to the meeting in Lower Novgorod"?
"Then there was no foreign connection.
In the pre-session, teams were doing other tasks, and many young people were playing.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey.
"The motorist" is a good team.
The tournament table makes it clear that the team is playing right.
Good hockey, good atmosphere, both in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them luck.
The team moves in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good raffle.
It was hard, we were preparing.
We knew the team was coming unscathed, and we wanted to break it, but it didn't work."

United States of America is responding to an increase in the production of opiates in Afghanistan
The dramatic deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September was much talked about in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations involving China, Iran, India, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nicolai Patrusev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, militants have waged a genuine terrorist war against the authorities of the State and the peaceful population of the country.
This year has become the record number of bloody attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” said Patrusev.
The troubles of Afghanistan did not start yesterday.
Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the main enemy of the United States was the Al-Qaida (prohibited in the Russian Federation) terrorist group which settled in Afghanistan.
Within a month, America and NATO allies launched a military operation called Enduring Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
A thousand-year-old United States contingent is still on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
The U.S. troops have been driven to take dozens of their bases.
As much as they can, they'll be paid off of the fighters for money, unless they're touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40 per cent, according to Patruzev.
50 per cent are in the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% is for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they grow there quickly.
The aim is to create a barbarous pseudo-halfate in Central Asia - exactly what they failed to do in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be doing well.
It is also encouraging that drug production (opiats) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times over the 17 years of the United States presence.
The huge growth of the area sown with opium poppy and multi-billion-dollar profits.
The Macedonians are preparing to vote in the referendum for accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change of country name.
An agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia, seeing in that name the attack on the same-name Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkowski, a political scientist, says: “By means of this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia is entitled to a better future, a hope for social change.
And Greece will secure the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot bring happiness to everyone.”
The name of the country is adopted by the ruling social democracies, headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
The opposition is the conservative opposition and the President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Quettin Chilemanov, Macedonia has no point in entering the EU - it is sufficient to have a partnership with it: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, headed by Zaev, is imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, I will lose my sovereignty.
There are clearly countries that would not like Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the greatest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine not only the future of the Balkans but also of Europe as a whole.”
