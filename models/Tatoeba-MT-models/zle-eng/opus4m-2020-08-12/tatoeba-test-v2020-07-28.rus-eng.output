I can't explain it to you.
He's scared of dogs.
The party was full of girls.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
How did you impress Tom?
Why does he hate me?
Don't bother him.
He knows her from high school.
Tom pretended nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident almost cost him his life.
He picked up the bottle.
We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't get me wrong.
Why are you so mysterious?
You're just running away from life's problems.
Out of the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting three hours.
I failed the exam.
Eat while it's hot.
So I had to wait three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Maria's an idiot.
I told Tom to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you were coming, either.
I ran into Tom in Boston last week.
Tom is beautiful.
Tom didn't know Mary liked cooking.
I told him you were busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
You want an anecdote?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
You sure you know what Tom needs to do?
I can't just ignore him.
She's riding a bicycle to school.
I'll be right there!
Do you want to drive?
I did all day yesterday.
They're peers.
There was a coin at the table.
It's empty.
Wash up the windows.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
A caravan of fifty camels moved about in the desert without haste.
You should be ashamed of your ignorance.
I changed places with Tom.
Tom went to park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I'm not trying to convince you.
I knew Tom wouldn't lose.
Tom told Mary he wanted to drink.
What are you smiling about?
Tom didn't say how he was gonna get there.
Didn't I tell you I had peanut allergies?
I know how old you are.
I won't show it to anyone else.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't mean to upset Tom.
I'll teach you.
I have food.
He moved on to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to strangle Mary.
I decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win any more.
Cosmonauts wear suitors.
Algeria buys artillery weapons from Russia.
Shall I tell the One what happened?
I have nothing to give you.
Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
It's empty in this room.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe it?
We slept under the open sky.
Don't lock the door.
When are you free?
Tom shouldn't have done that on October 20th?
I have to go to work right now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it begin?
It's one of the five senses.
What do you got?
They're afraid of him.
Tom's at work.
Tom is hiding something from us.
He didn't even touch him.
Have you got a name for your new-born?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a professional.
I got a cold from him.
I like Brazil, but I'm still going to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do it.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
The humpback's gonna fix it.
The soup is so hot that it's impossible to eat.
Why is it so popular?
They have declared their innocence.
Where did you get hurt so much?
I don't think they're friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I've been waiting for them to make good news.
Distilled water is tasteless.
Dad's in the garden right now.
Harry works part-time at a local supermarket.
It's very unlikely I'm going to be late.
I told them to be in their hats.
Tom said he was exhausted.
I used to dream of being a millionaire.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom's planning on breaking up with his girlfriend.
Where are you tonight?
Tom closed the door to his bedroom.
I only knew Tom for a few months.
You're hopeless!
Tom plays the violin very well.
Nobody blames you.
The next year is the Rabbit.
Tom almost always takes a bath before dinner.
I can take you home.
What did you learn?
Please write down what I say.
Now I'm adding the last strokes.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have any books.
Dennis is the only sport Tom has.
Come to the fire.
Let me help you.
I was very tired, so I fell asleep.
Tom's my favorite singer.
Remember I love you.
He's said to be a murderer.
Mary didn't want to wear an open suit on Halloween, so she decided to dress like an amish woman.
Tom picked up his hat.
Tom waited three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to drink.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have children.
I won't do that anymore.
Every morning I go shopping.
The baby's pushing.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom didn't even slow down.
I don't want Tom to go anywhere without me.
I've been watching you do business.
He's got great math skills.
Watch out!
He's the father of a new man.
The men were men then.
Swiss banks are very secretive.
Once you're done with your mission, you can drink as much as you want.
I'm the only one who can help you.
I hate winter.
What do you think Tom will say when he finds out?
Christmas is approaching.
Do you want us to do this together?
All our attempts were wasted.
He poured himself another glass.
Please, I'm starting the patient's audition now, and make sure you've checked this procedure, and you'll have to turn to her use tomorrow.
Please, salt.
She spent all her money.
Tom slept in the barn.
You're gonna ruin your eyes.
Tom was tall for his age.
Did you notice Mary's earrings?
You're gonna be late for school again.
What's your favorite movie jinx?
So I didn't have to ask me twice.
You have to go to Boston.
I jumped for joy.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I rarely see you and Tom.
I'm pretty tall.
From a practical point of view, he has many shortcomings.
It's the house I live in.
I go to school with him.
Your face shows you don't agree.

We need to tell people what to do.
If it's cheap, I'll buy it.
I told him what to do.
She almost drowned.
It was a good movie.
Are you wet?
I'll never let you forget it.
Tom said I shouldn't talk to you.
Who were you gonna sell it?
I don't want a divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom got angry.
The missing boy was identified by his clothes.
I've got good reflexes.
Tell me what it looked like.
She'll probably refuse to follow his advice because she doesn't like it.
Did you pee?
I know you work for them.
I hope I can help you.
Does your parents know about this?
The waitress put a white tablemate on the table.
I stayed home that day because it was raining.
Is there a pharmacy nearby?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why does Tom look at me like this?
I called the police and told them my car was stolen.
We can discuss it later.
It's a little helpful.
Cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak frankly?
I work for an oil company.
Why don't you find someone else who needs your help?
Tom put a wet towel on Mary's forehead.
He hurt his left hand.
Is she Italian?
We want to leave.
The population of this city is declining every year.
Dan didn't want to be shy.
Could you tell me anything about yourself?
Did you find the difference between these two pictures?
I've never seen so many books collected in one place.
You look a little depressed.
Don't forget to call me.
Cats have horny language.
I would never do that.
Fix it, please.
We need to attach an ice bag to our ankles to reduce our backs.
I could show you town.
I know Tom's sick.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Take another cookie.
I want to sleep!
You must be an idiot.
Tom's in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here today.
"Who are you by nationality?" "Argentines."
Why are you sad?
I can do it much better than you can.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
Zontik's broken.
Tom put his room in order.
Did you file a complaint?
I don't like Tom very much.
So I'm going to have to change my plans.
Someone bit him.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have the money.
How's your new Mary dress?
There was fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I'll tell her.
Can I trust you with a secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom said he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was right there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Snack it.
Tom wakes up from a deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do it.
I hope I see him on Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
There are no girls on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why this happened.
We'll send them a card.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look left and right before crossing the road.
Tom was my friend too.
I didn't know her then.
We've heard those promises before.
What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm very upset.
As often as it happens, Mike's late for a meeting this afternoon.
Tom told me Mary had a new boyfriend.
We won't let that happen.
Those fools broke the law prohibiting breaking the law.
It's not done yet.
John spoke so loud that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his vision.
I didn't give it to Tom.
Strange rumors.
I know you're rich.
Bill set aside $100 on a trip.
He served in the fleet.
Who taught you to dance?
Tom's nagging his nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I'm not lying.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine do you buy?
I'm not gonna do anything.
He got in the car and left.
Tell Tom everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do my homework.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We don't know the side effects of this drug yet.
Tom's had teeth for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies last.
That's the girl that came by yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.
You said it was yours.
Where did he get those shoes?
Don't make me do it.
What did you smile at?
Tom usually goes to work on a bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've been working with Tom before.
Tom and I are team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more often every time I see her.
Is that what I'm thinking?
Everyone but Tom has hats.
She gives him anything he asks.
Is it for sale?
I'm getting angry.
Do you have this big?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
It only makes the problem worse.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a drooping barrel in the toilet.
I called the doorbell.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're gone.
Can I take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the bag.
I did that when I was a kid.
Something very good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't get into other people's business.
Who's wearing the blue shirt?
Tom has an American accent.
I don't have any money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are good for your eyes.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She was saving herself for marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom shaved.
It's 30 o'clock.
The lion is strong.
I had to make sure he came here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy fixed the cap.
Maybe we should go for a walk.
He's capable of math.
I'm glad you told me about her.

Did you read them?
I told him I wouldn't help him.
Tom regrets leaving Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom speaks a terrible French language.
I don't remember how much I paid for it.
You don't eat with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and three children.
I barely got on the train.
I don't like arguing.
Do you like science fiction movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house is outside the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many pens!
Mary, are you all right now?
I fixed a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 pushes.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle the job.
After Mary gave Tom a scoop, threw a glass of wine through it, and took a firm step out of the restaurant, there was a dead silence.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom's gonna paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you're gonna need a loan.
Tom's father, who's in prison, never writes Tom.
It's expensive.
I haven't heard from him for a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought it was time for us all to meet.
Everyone's interested in Japan.
Tom is very easy to lose.
Please, just do it like I do.
Stay there.
I don't agree with him.
That's what luck is called.
It was so dark in the room that I had to get through the feeling.
How many air carriers are there in the U.S. Army?
Is she your teacher?
Sleep again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom realizes he's no longer needed.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in pots of winter.
I speak French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom should've told Mary.
Why is everybody watching me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so weird.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
How long are you awake?
Take out the trash.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy candles?
Canada is a hockey family on ice.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese is good.
The thief went through the window.
Spiders are disgusting little creatures.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss no mustache like no salt soup.
Did you try to talk to him?
Where are the other prisoners?
So many things happened today.
I saw a car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom was working with Mary.
I'm tired to death.
Do you know what your kids are doing now?
Do you want her to stay?
He misses her.
Please tell me I'm right.
We've seen the castle.
Tom kept ticking her.
Six goes in front of the family.
Today I went to my grandfather's grave.
Tom couldn't believe someone wanted to kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.
I saw a man eating from a garbage tank yesterday.
I think Tom lied to me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Maria stopped laughing when they noticed John crying.
I have to meet Tom.
Tom lost his finger.
Did you sign the contract?
I told him he should talk to a lawyer.
Did they get on the wrong bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of girlfriends.
The area has changed completely.
Tom is an anti-Semitism.
What is your strongest part?
Tom doesn't like being pushed.
I wonder, when Angelica Agurbash sang a song to Neklaev, could she have imagined that he would run for president?
There's yogurt in the fridge.
Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom always speaks frankly.
Thomas must be there by two and thirty.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he's extremely tired.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why aren't you looking for him?
They survived despite the destruction of the building.
I wouldn't want anything better.
Tom wants popcorn.
My favorite restaurant was burned.
John's not paying attention, he makes a lot of mistakes.

Who's this guy?

I knew what Jacksons were doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three grandchildren.
He wants peanut butter.
You're lucky.
Tom starts getting a little drunk.
I barely understood it.
He escaped the bait.
You can live in a big house and still feel no comfort.
I'm expecting Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one minus two.
Red's better.
The universe is infinite.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you want to say?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom for a word?
Don't make a noise like that.
When was Tom arrested?
We're eating at six.
The deer was the victim of a lion.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try and get her to help us.
Are you with us?
Make a wish.
Tom's alive.
The log may lie in the water for ten years, but it won't become a crocodile.
Tom pretended he didn't understand what Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw it happen.
I think there can be no other reason than this.
I'm very happy right now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How can you always be so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What an ego!
So you bought it?
A man's as old as he feels and a woman's what she looks like.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
There's been a lot of snow in the last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everything seems happy.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
Don't you want another daughter?
I like walking along the river.
You can come with me.
This dictionary is a great gift to us.
“How much before dinner?” “Five minutes”.
Tell her.
Mary spent all her time working.
Tom sat on his bike and started it.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I've been waiting until ten.
Tom usually says the first thing that comes to his mind.
Why do you want to leave?
How's "bye" French?
It didn't cost that much.
What's wrong with your computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not going to fire you.
You really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend so much money?
Mary likes hanging out with bad guys.
It is often said that every week in the world, one language is missing.
She has a small advantage.
I thought we were talking about it.

I feed the cat every morning and evening.
Keep your mouth shut, that's not what you're gonna get.
You must take into account all the consequences before making any changes to the existing code.

Last night, we had a lot of rain.
What did Tom bring?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed the door was open.
That's when I hurt my holinostop.
There's nothing more to say about him.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Go home early, Bill.
She was sitting on a chair reading the magazine.
It is prohibited to cry from that moment on.
If I knew it, I'd tell you.
Here's the house he lived in.
I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to you.
Eat my chocolate?
In white, the house seems bigger.
I had difficulty finding an original quote.
I had no idea you knew her.
What's the point of doing that?
What dog is yours?
You have to give Tom more time.
You didn't tell me Tom was speaking French.
Tom's going back to Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a French movie with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.
I think Tom was a good player.
He only blames others, and he never blames himself.
Do you know how to play banjo?
Tom came up to Mary and hugged her.
"When will you come back?" "It depends on the weather."
How many turtles live?
How safe is it?
Your communication has been received.
It took me three years to complete the construction of my house.
I was irritated.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do that.
Tom didn't want us to attend his party.
I suddenly realized what was going on.
She said she'd be late.
Are your parents still living in Germany?
I need it today.
Tom will probably win.
What would you like to have Grandpa Christmas bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your adventurer spirit?
Why are you mad at me?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've met before.
Something tells me you're right.
This isn't my cat.
The captain ordered his men to shoot.
Sit down there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's engaged to my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, you have to think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl, and work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I failed.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
That sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy this.
I've never seen you in a hat.
Put him on the regiment.
I thought you found someone else.
There is always an enormous number of vehicles on this road.
You lied to all of us.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It doesn't make sense to pretend that you're making me believe that I believe in something you don't believe in!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I've been pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
You think that's possible?
In the end, he got sick.
You think Tom's locked up?
If it's true, she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom didn't seem to recognize you.
I refuse to help Tom.
Can I sit with her?
Leave it to yourself.
Do you read anything other than the Bible?
Read me the statement from the cat's counter.
How does this gentleman make a living?
Why do you think Tom likes it?
Your parents know about this?
Is that what they're talking about?
Tom's waiting for you at the conference room.
The main thing about Tatobe is not to utter thoughts above the stomach and below the knees.

How long does the train arrive in Boston?
What are the words for this song?
Mary likes to tease her brother.
The law is on my side.
So I had to find a place to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The article was published on the occasion of Professor's birthday.
Your phone rang several times while you were in the shower.
She married him for money.
Not any bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
Tom has to make his own decisions.
The account, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
You have a birthday soon.
Count.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom's been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just an image I download on the Internet.
I think that's why it's less than thirty.
Did you drink?
Without a doubt, it is best for this work.
You're making it easier for me to work.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I love you.
It doesn't seem like you're too busy.
Deadline's gone.
You look much like me.
Do you know those men?
Tom left the room without telling anyone a word.
That probably didn't happen.
Have you finished lunch yet?
Tom and Mary spoke for at least an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He was trying to save her.
If you click this button, the door will open.
How many ties do you need?
I'm back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Did you hear the last rumors?
I'd show you how to do that.
I begged Tom to come.
You've got a burp.
My mother taught me not to waste money.
We could walk.
She died yesterday afternoon.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took a seat for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I cried for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know it's important to you.
They all knew her.
We should stop.
I'm not gonna be late anymore.
I'm terribly hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom takes care of the horses.
Why doesn't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if they're killed.
They cut Tom off from the life support equipment.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
I'm sorry about my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom's half your age.
Tom closed the cover.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is heat, which can be derived from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you tell Tom first?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He wouldn't dare do that.
The 12-hour journey got me tired.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
No one saw us do it.
He came back two days later.
Tom had breakfast.
We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are engaged.
Food!
Did you help Tom wash the windows?
It's beyond my competence.
That was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm just here.
Don't tell the One what actually happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
What do you say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Come down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends those cards.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I dropped the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read that book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this picture?
Tom gave me both the money and the advice.
What do you want me to say?
Please open the door.

She married him at the age of 20.
I can't give anyone that dictionary.
Give me that box.

There's a lot of girls in the room.
He talks too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in her coffee.
Didn't you know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They tried to buy time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
While living among the people, Jesus Christ spoke in Hebrew, from the point of view of the Jews, the Greek dialect of the Aramic language instead of Hebrew, thus showing the failure to establish the existence of a sacred language whose use in prayer was particularly close to God.
Tom's changed his mind.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So they paid $300 for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom's gonna do.
Weather forecast was correct.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to make you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.

I wish I could tell them what to say.
Tom's children must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He's reading physics at Oxford.
He was hiding that fact from me.

Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.

Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is this?
I've got a hangover.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
It's a good car for sale.
I need to work this weekend.
You can't do that to us.
His words confused me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom should have done.
Say hello to her from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer rocked everyone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I have to go now.
Where was your son?
I saw it at the store.
The world is cruel.
I have a very strong dream.
There is no one but himself.
I'm from Sidsoukee.
Tom slept in his backyard all the trees.
Saturday is the day he's free.
I wonder what happened to her.

Tom screams at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom kind of said Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very insightful.
Over and over in our lives there are obstacles, some calling them problems, others talking about opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
He told me he wanted to leave the company.

Shall we go?
I knew I could trust you!

What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It looks like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving?
Neither Tom nor Mary was ever in Boston.
Have you ever snooped?
If I had the money, I'd buy a computer.
Tom smiles?
She went to Paris.
Tom's at school now, isn't he?
Please let us know.
Tom nodded and headed for the door.
It was just a joke.
Try and prove me wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Are you in pain somewhere?
He couldn't go because he didn't have enough money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't turn in French.
I think that's why you can trust me.
There's a lot of puzzles in life.
Is it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's a rotten apple.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Toma's favorite city.
It's a shame when someone dies.
Are you feeling better?
What makes you think we're interested?

Thinking that she was alone, they worried me.
The river flows in size.

He's sure to come.
Any messages?
I got a phone call yesterday.
We really need this.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I've decided to give up.

Falling, she hit her elbow.
I'm sick.
We'll deal with Tom later.
Do you want to be rich?

I'm proud of you.
She doesn't like my manner of speaking.
Mary wants another child.
I don't care what you do to your money.
I'd like to see the boss.
Tom didn't go to Boston by car.
The weather forecast cannot be relied upon.
She's still young.
Did you follow Tom's advice?
Tom said he's a teletonic.
How's your father?
Did they say when?
This car looks angry.
Do you study English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money for a new dress.
Why does the moon shine at night?

Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do it.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Do you know everybody here?
Tom didn't know how to read until he was 13.
I prefer quail eggs.
She lives in Muhosransk.
People who aren't smarter than I am don't care.
Is that your first visit to Australia?

Which floor does Tom live on?
No direct flights to Bologna.
I live outside the city.
Give me a few hours.
Don't make yourself eat if you don't want to.
I have a commission for Tom.
"How was the accident?" "No one knows."
What do you like about it?
When I got to the station, I called my friend.
I need a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.
Tom got rid of his foreign accent.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.

I know you work hard.
I love the Ural languages.
I hope you're wrong about this.
Sometimes we need to tell the truth.
Tom's a pompist.
I have an offer for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are about to get married on October 20.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
He's got a lot of talents.
He's in a bad mood.
How would you like to be called?
He's got a Japanese father.
Who would want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was tired.
He's staying up till late at night.
Tom's room is very small.
You speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
That song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we could do.
I'm proud of them.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his oven.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We need to be prepared.
What was his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left Mary his keys.
I'm talking to him all the time.
I can't help laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God prefigured the reconciliation of Kingdom power and priesthood in Jesus Christ.
You want me to talk to Tom?
Each of us went to our home.
It's thin, but it's strong, and it doesn't make any sense.
It's all a little silly.
I don't know what I want right now.
It's incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six or five for TV viewers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom is interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really that bad?
Tell me, please, where you're going to live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I'm not nice.
Do you cry a lot?
We did not expect such results.
I already read it.
If the car breaks down, let's walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Did you find anything interesting?
Everybody's doing it.
I often visit relatives.

You should be punished for what you did.
They climbed the stairs.
She has to drink water.
It's one of the most ugly buildings I've ever seen.
The robber broke into the post office in the middle of the afternoon.
That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My desk's old.
We're both very busy.
The darkness is impenetrable.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll pick you up.
Tom tried to drown in the bathtub.
Tom and I are growing up.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Maria's younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes playing cards.
It's a big book.
Don't talk about Tom that way.
I kind of made it very clear.
We've been waiting three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Times can change, but human nature is the same.
Tom looks really upset.
I brought some cookies.
Next year Tom will be teaching French.
I listened to her through.
I advised Tom to rest.
Why are you getting angry with this?
The worst part of the trip is already behind.
We'll miss both of you.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you!
This knife was very useful to me.
How do you know what I had?
It'll only take a minute.
This is a situation I would really like to change.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to believe any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a squirrel in a wheel.
He didn't get through it.
Do you want to come with us?
Tom can swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We plan to leave as soon as possible.
He went skiing in Hokkaido.
"Shut up your fucking music and read your book." "I see my censuring spell still works!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did it without you.
You're bleeding out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you'll be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore that.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the supermarket nearby?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're lying, join us.
Tom wanted to ask Mary for her forgiveness again.
Tom was thinking.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been.
I really wish I could come with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't gonna do it.
I can't trust you.
I bought bread.
Let's go quickly, or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom doesn't leave.
Tom and Mary changed places.
How do they take you out?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful man, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at risk.
Mary sewed Alice's new dress.
That decision was difficult to make.
I thought you'd want to drink.
I got what you asked.
He said he'd do it.
So you didn't have to leave.
Mary recovered from her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Eating meat is harmful to your health and your environment.
You're telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to say a word for me.
Nobody loves me.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.
You told him?
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you've just been thinking about something.
Sahara is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like most in Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is a weeping eva.
I don't have this book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is at the center of the solar system.
Are you a cop?
Tom failed me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut my eyebrows.
Tom and Mary seem more than just friends.
The river was watering the garden.
A strong wind at night.
The ants and the giraffes are distant relatives.
Tom did it because I told him.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom was carrying two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to recognize me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to lying down early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom does is watch television.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious pear I've ever eaten.
I had parking problems.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
It's not mine.
Do you know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom was never late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each sheet.
You're hard to take seriously.
The members of the tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When did it begin?
Nobody cares what she thinks.
I don't think that's weird.
"Where did you get my phone from?" "Tom gave it."
When will you clean up the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does that make sense?
Why are you shutting the door?
Tom said he tried three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's not tall, but strong.
It's cool this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
You can find Tom, please.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is not clear.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
You don't know what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
The lesson is endless!
This box weighs a ton.
He gets it all because he's a bummer.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It seemed like he was gonna kiss me.
Don't stare at me.
Are you having fun?
It won't happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
I was free all day yesterday, and I'm working today.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a mobile phone.
Don't lose your patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a terrible person!
Carton's stronger than paper.
Don't be angry with him.
You've exceeded your mandate.
The curse was destroyed.
Thomas' great-grandfather was born blind.
Tom is above you, right?
She hurt her back while playing tennis.
Tom's scared.
This table is white.
It was a weird game.
I've heard about all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm coming with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
They went to the mountain resort last summer.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What do you expect Tom to do?
She seemed completely calm.
Press the button.
Tom went with Mary to the museum.
Tom was intrigued by what was happening.
Mary wore boots to her knee.
That's a lie.
I'll follow them.
She said she had a cold.
The traffic inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to follow his father's footsteps.
I don't see any problem here.
I don't have to do it tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's terribly bitter.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on my way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Last time Tom was the first.
Everything's different.
I have to see you.
I lost your phone.
Get the tree over there.
You usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom will fix it.
Tom said good-bye to his sister.
Mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't know what you're trying to say.
Little pots have long pens.
Tom was in his sandwiches.
There's a bench underneath the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How's my story?
Tom turned off the alarm and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you sing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom often plays guitar.
I tried to warn Tom.
The train was filled.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he's not planning to go.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
Tom's got a cable?
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for his help.
Tom could have told me.
It's going to make your family miserable.
I was really nervous.
Tom said I should go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You should try to stay awake.
My mother is very helpful.
Tom has a snake on his back.
Did you buy meat from the supermarket?
He hit me on a mistake.
What's the name of this dog?
Go to the sidewalk.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's father is.
It's raining like a bucket.
The whole country is talking about it.
I can't wait to tell him.
You can't buy any happiness.
Tom grew up in a children's home.
I don't want to watch this video.
The poorest EU country is the poorest U.S. state?
Say hi to Tom from me.
I want to thank you for what you did for Tom.
I bumped into my friend.
Are you working with Tom?

Be realistic.

That's what we think.
How could something like this happen?

Tom was crazy.
I forgot to ask.
My hands and legs are always dead.
How do I translate words that are not in any languages other than mine?
Could you tie this tape?
I'm going home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.

What upset you?
I'm too busy talking to you right now.

Stop singing.
Only six people came to the party.

I saw you spying on Tom.
I need you to do it right now.
The robber entered the house through this door.

I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Tehran.
"Do you speak Greek?" "Not yet, this is my first lesson!"
Why did you give him money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
You went to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you talk her into it?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We will do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's late for the plane.
She always gets up early.
Do you want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the deepest part of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy at that store?
When do we have a woman president?
He's here hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is close to our school.

Do you want to work with them?
Interesting was the film.
I don't have the strength to work from morning till evening.

It's a fake.
Tom's very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What's going to happen to Tom?
I hope you don't catch cold.
He's targeting a bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Oh, come on!
I have to go on.
She put her nose against the glass.
There are no differences between the sayings ser and estar in English.
I know exactly what to do.

Do I have any messages?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing an SMS while driving is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The pitchfork was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Thomas to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he has to explain to me.
I was very calm.
Everybody's got something to hide.
We'll have some guests tonight.
Her voice will still ring in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time does everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss an accident.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds did not fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I told him you came to Australia.
Did you look for it?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where am I waiting for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain this to me?
We were caught by a snowstorm.
The book's on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What do we lose?
You better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She never replied to his letter.
I hired someone today.
Stop fooling around!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm on the stairs.
It's the largest car in the world.
Tom hardly asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do it that way.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You won't introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told him Mary had to do this.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How long did it take you?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's boss.
Who are you planning on going to Australia?
Someone was yelling.
Which one's the best?
We appreciate your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell him to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train's going to 3:30.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the beasts from the cage.
He's scared of cats.
You look like your dad.
George's five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you've been told.
Please watch this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't count on your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're much higher than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on having a son.

We have to help.
Tom just got out of jail.
Did you tell Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've developed a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know what you'd do for me.
I can't believe Tom did it.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only philosophy can use the vicious circle of evidence and be commended for it.
I can't afford to have children.
When I was speaking to them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and they couldn't make these fools understand their own language.
Shall I go?
I was so stupid I believed it.
She did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
My mother must be angry.
White bread, please.
The owls are cute.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're perfect for each other.
French is complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger was over.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was angry.
Let me know if you need any help.
We should get there before he does.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Is Paris far away?
How much time is it in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
Nobody knew why.
Jim won't be here tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where'd you take off your shoes?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it's gonna be Christmas snow this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like a cup of coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth lately.
You're the only one who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have a second chance.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All accounts have to pay me.
She's cold.
Tom said he's looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's wearing Mary's hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he likes it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the lazyst person I know.
Mary's already out of her room?
I will forgive him this time.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a rosy.
Alvaro of Venezuela, he's a Venezuelan.
That's the bill.
He insulted me publicly.
Tom won't win anymore.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnets are used in induction plates for the direct heating of the pots and pans.
I burst into tears.
Tom wants to learn to play trombon.
Come out now.
Can I look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 pesetas with you to replace the lightning on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom still lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I've got two tickets to the concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's a scoop of pancakes.
He issued several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in the pajamas?
How much is it worth?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to look after the garden.
The rice cup weighs about a hundred eighty grams.
I should've left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom from half-third.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Did anybody else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
The infection got into the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me.
Tom's watching TV sometimes.
I'm ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I'm still bad at thinking.
Run, chickens!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay greater attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two o'clock in the morning.
Mary was not thirsty.
So it wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought it would be.
I don't like that.
I was trying to wake Tom.
They say the film's very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
Apparently, she's healthy.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Watch your brother.
Tom said he wasn't waiting for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner?
I love bitter pepper.
How long do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to my coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about the money.
There are no winners.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can draw.
They're packed.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was there snow last night?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you die?
Tom knows French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to go.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why nobody else wanted to go to the beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defence.
How does faith differ from trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If we allow the weather, we'll climb to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
We both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His gray eyes glistened and opened, and his usually pale face became alive and covered with Romanian.
What kind of pizza do you love most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take another one.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands turned blue with the cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
I'm having a hard time solving this problem.
The typhoon destroyed many houses.
This man was condemned to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Can anyone speak French here?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me get your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Authority is in Tom's hands.
I learned to do and play as my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's gonna blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play more than to learn.
He was taken for his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my dad.
Guess what language I'm speaking.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to doing this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
What, all of a sudden, got into fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're upset.
The day before yesterday, our grandson was born.
Tom's got a pirate suit.
It's pure truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom has to be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll help you out.
We are proud of our achievement.
So I should've invited Mary.
Thomas had to be punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities closed.
I sweat every day.
She became an e-mail.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know this man is the man he claims to be?
King Harald Hormsson, better known as Harald Sinesuba, introduced Christianity into Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You gotta get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go into this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Hess.
I've never really spoken Portuguese.
When criminal cases are brought to trial, it is generally accepted that there should be 12 in the jury court.
What exactly did Tom do at Australia's Embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys were marching four in a row.
Tom was very confused.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was gonna do this.
There's been another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
You're watching your weight?
Tom plays trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You're probably not gonna be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds is world famous for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like those perfumes?
The lock's broken.
Diamond is a precious stone.
Eat some cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stand down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many suffer from underassessment?
Was it too easy?
What Alice encountered while waiting for her answer was a sudden war, which was a loud noise, so sharp as to break her drums, and so loud enough to reach the sky.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he entered the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
So you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get her stuff in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom was reluctant to give Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We have to hire him.
I tried to solve the problem in vain.
You were supposed to do your homework.
I was talking on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy I couldn't lift it up.
Why doesn't Tom sleep?
It's going to end, and it's going to go back.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your name.
A monkey climbs into a tree.
The language I'm learning is very complicated.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
You really live alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom has the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president has ruled for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Could you solve this question?
And Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
In the 20th floor building.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You don't know when Tom comes back, do you?
I don't have pictures of Tom.
Can you hold on for a while?
Are you gonna give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you work with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would have been a rich man right now.
I made this decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to try and jump with a parachut.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time are you planning on staying home tonight?
The bag's empty.
You feeling okay?
He's obstinate like a donkey.
I think you can be trusted.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling Mary would bring her new boyfriend to a party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but some girl picked up.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she would win.
We've got to stick to the plan.
I'll tell the one you called.
Tom's very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for worse.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They always complain.
Tom's got a little hairy.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of scattered.
Don't get mad at her.
I'd rather stay.
So a brilliant idea came to mind.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place safe?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and orderly.
I suspect Tom should go to Boston next week.
Don't go on somebody else's land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Famine was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
The hall needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom's here early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's a leftist.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
She had legs.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it very often.
I hope we don't do it again.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
Those jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get here, there'll be a time to open.
I'm not sure how big she has.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll leave as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas's gone from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
We cried with him.
You don't want to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you getting so naked?
It can be made of butter, cheese, and much more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you a relative to her?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug a well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was gonna buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Be good.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an unnamed guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won as everyone expected.
He blinked back.
Tom said Mary was pleased.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
You didn't think of asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Can you say that in human language?
No one was hungry except me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowflake in the snowy lava don't think it's his fault.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like this?
I'm gonna solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When will the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
It's time to spit.
I really liked that book.
You're important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she could spend the night with her.
Tom didn't tell the police his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to remain positive.
I was in pain.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
The girl had a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was deceived.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who do you want to play Tom with?
I need a light coat.
I finished my assignment.
It's a cat.
Please tell me it's not true.
You're not coming in?
I fixed his radio.
That's a really bad idea.
Tom is above you.
Tom found a job.
Is that a public book?
Could you please speak louder?
I'll tell him to contact Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please address me, except as James Matveewicz.
She's not alone anymore.
Tom never admits he's wrong because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
I've been to America before.
It took longer than I expected.
Mary stayed with her father.
I thought I could trust her.
Do you have a new StevieWander album?
I was thrown out of my house because I didn't pay rent.
Tell me where you went.
He stopped resisting and submitted to his fate.
It happened on Park Street.
Eduardo's younger than Roberto.
The moon is the earth’s satellite.
I don't know, go to bed.
There's nothing in nature that's useless.
No, she never fell in love.
You did it on purpose!
You won't need it.
Tom rarely goes to a party.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're coming.
Do I look like a guy who wants to get married?
I closed the door, but I didn't lock it.
So we should be careful not to kiss Mary publicly.
Are we gonna help them?
Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so hard on me.
Now I'm in charge of the parade!
People, good for us all year.
I don't feel sorry for you.
I know Tom won't give up.
I don't really like her.
He's not here.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are about to get married on October 20.
She thought I'd let her down.
Now I live in Boston.
Tom took his secret with him to the grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anybody else wants to do this.
We're teachers.
You must like me very much.
Why are you so worried about her?
I'll never do that again.
Do aliens exist?
Emily wants to be an electrician.
These books are better than those.
Don't try to remember every sentence in the text, it's almost impossible.
He's been teaching French for eight years.
I thought it was you.
Personally, I think you're right.
I can't believe I did it.
The candle's hot.
Why don't you bring me something to drink?
We're collecting blankets for homeless people.
Tom paid Mary a very decent salary.
What do you think?
Let's get breakfast quick.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
Never in life!
Did Tom ever ask you to help him?
The chair needs to be fixed.
I thought you were right.
Why is everyone watching us?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did I make your name right?
No one saw her leave the room.
Wa-bank.
Tom's never gonna find him.
All women are the same.
He let them walk in the garden.
I don't have a crystal ball.
Your love is false.
She's about my age.
Did you really do this for free?
You want me to open the box?
Boys will always be boys and girls will always be girls.
You should go to bed, turn off the radio.
There's nothing new about his addiction to alcohol.
He doesn't realize the risks.
So you don't have to do this anymore.
Do you have any idea who could do that?
The teacher warned us that the examination was likely to be difficult.
I'm a married man.
He bought his son a camera.
Shut up and eat.
I gave you everything.
I'm going to dedicate this song to you.
I like her better.
You're too small to know what a log line is.
I've done it almost every day before.
I'm deeply shocked.
About a billion people suffer from hunger and poverty.
I am pleased to inform you that your work has been accepted for publication in SM.
I'm convinced of my right hand.
I didn't know you wanted to learn French.
Let's go home.
You have time.
I'm not coming.
Tom doesn't spend a lot of time thinking about money.
So we should go with Mary.
I wonder what Tom's doing here.
You're not all-powerful.
I don't think I can go faster.
Tom's got questions left.
Are you looking for someone?
Tom's hand bit the ant.
So I didn't have to hide.
He'll be leaving his parents' house soon.
I don't think he'll hear us.
I want to go to England.
Have you seen anyone in the park?
Did I not warn you not to go there?
Tom moved here from Australia three years ago.
She left Boston.
We need to consider all the options.
Tom could have killed me.
Grandpa Ali was a drummer.
Why didn't anyone tell us?
He's in the pajamas.
I went looking for Tom in the lobby.
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
He's more or less aware of his problems.
Tom claimed to have seen UFO.
I know who you were with.
Tom has a bicycle?
What did you ask them?
The repairs are good.
I'm having breakfast every morning.
It's not mud, it's ficha.
Are you in trouble with the car?
At the tourist information centre, the map of the city was issued to anyone who wished.
I'm sorry, but I can't.
Tom closed all the windows.
Come as soon as you can.
We're not really hungry yet.
Study Chinese, not to impress your future boss, but to understand what she is saying.
You can add proposals that you can't translate by yourself, maybe someone else can do it!
Mary's always home, isn't she?
Just ignore Tom.
I don't think I'm going to be prejudiced.
I'm sorry I didn't notice that.
I'm teaching.
I knew Tom was bluffing.
I tried my best.
That's a good sign.
Some are convinced that they are protected by a guardian angel.
Tom emptied his bank account.
She's at the hotel.
What's going to happen to me about this?
He was so interested that he paid attention to it.
I told him I didn't care.
Tom wants to change society.
I thought you didn't see anything.
We're both here for the same reason.
Love is strong, money is stronger.
I saw him naked.
There's a lot of children's books in our library.
I didn't let her go home early.
Did you talk to her?
How long will it take to get there?
I didn't mean to interfere with you.
We all wished each other good luck.
Tom was born three days before Christmas in 2013.
The young girl was silent.
When Tom heard his favorite song on the radio, he couldn't help but start singing.
When will it end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
The resulting stain did leave a trail on her skirt.
Is Tom dating someone?
Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving.
They're fake.
When you came back, I'd already left.
Did you talk to him today?
I thought you stopped seeing him.
Tom's calling Mary.
She pollinates flowers.
My wife often calls me when she's going abroad.
You're in bed.
First of all, I would like to make my position clear.
Tom can play banjo.
Tom didn't decide what to do.
He doesn't like coffee.
Please turn on the radio.
You don't make Tom cry.
The police can't arrest Tom.
How did you get into my room?
What do you want Tom to do?
We want to go to Australia.
I have a very small salary.
Tom's been kicked by a bear.
Tom knows where Mary's going.
You scared them.
Tell her to leave.
I don't know anything about that.
We've been dating for three months.
I'm glad you were there.
They gave me a big party.
This mountain is covered in snow all year round.
Tom stopped at Mary's store to buy sugar.
I like being red.
Stay away from here.
What's the worst movie you've ever seen?
I thought you hated us.
Think before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.
I took it as a joke and I didn't answer it.
His name wasn't actually Tom Jackson.
Is that sarcastic?
Don't do anything you'll regret later.
Are you jealous of her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payment will be made according to experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.
Tom told me you were married.
I thought I wouldn't stay.
We look forward to you and your family.
Did you change it?
I told you I changed my mind.
Why did you say that?
You have to work hard if you want to succeed.
There's no exception in the esperanto.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home early today?
You wouldn't have survived.
Tom didn't think Mary would get upset.
There's a commercial area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
It's interesting news.
Tom's a bitter drunk.
We don't even know her.
Tom came up with a few suggestions and checked them out on Mary before he spilled them on Tatoeba.
I know where you're hiding your money.
At last school is over.
It's a long pencil.
Does your mother know about this?
Do you really like that kind of food?
Tom looked in the mirror.
I told them not to tell anyone.
That's how Tom died.
It's empty.
Write a pencil, please.
We can't leave.
He confessed to his crime.
This is the most beautiful painting I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
Something's bothering him.
Claudia sometimes thought about psychoanalysis.
Tom would never agree to that.
You need to find a job.
He'll be back later today, too.
She's very proud of herself.
I left about half-third.
Don't leave a tape on the sun.
I already knew that.
I watched them leave.
I'm surprised you remember them.
Hey, I know you.
"Help, help!
Can I open a curtain?
You didn't have any right to do that.
I'm yours.
He threw out exactly as much as he drank.
Let the earth be your swell, Father!
Why are you still alone?
I want us to be friends with your sister.
Who were you waiting for yesterday?
Do you like singing?
The road is slippery.
Tom's making breakfast.
Come in.
I'm saving them for my grandchildren.
I heard Carol and Will broke up.
What do you think, Tom?
Tom says he never did.
Tom seems like a nice person.
Help me find her.
Tom didn't give it to me.
I had to get under the fence.
Firemen couldn't hold the flames.
Help finally came.
It's a horse.
That's what happened here on Monday.
America has done away with slavery.
You don't recognize him?
Fortunately, he didn't die in an accident.
He often spends hours reading books.
I had no idea you could do that.
Tom unloaded his car.
Tom knew something about Mary that John didn't know.
There's no answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I shook my head.
Tom, you're on the phone.
You promised you wouldn't drink tonight.
Everything ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Come and see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think it works like this.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd be back.
What time are you coming tomorrow?
A box of holes.
Did you talk to Tom about it?
Is this a bat?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.
You can't make me marry you.
That's pretty weird.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up and she didn't.
We've got plenty of food today.
He gave a speech in which he supported my view.
Mount Kilimanjaro is a sleeping volcano in Tanzania
Why don't you go with her?
Why didn't you just tell them?
I can't rule it out.
Tom asked me why I never tried to get a driver's license.
I have to go back to Boston.
Have a seat, please.
Wake Tom up.
Here's the map.
You should have stayed with us.
Imagine we're alien.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
I have nothing to say to you.
I'd rather you didn't tell Tom about it.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I'm not gonna complain.
They kept their love secret.
She was in a hurry at the station only to delay the train.
Don't say that to my bride.
Tom's tired of always paying the bill when he and Mary go out.
I strongly recommend that you reconsider your decision.
I don't care about your past.
The police searched Tom's car.
Although I felt that something was strange, I didn't know it was.
Are you a pig?
I went to the army.
Why can't you take me for who I am?
Bear black.
Tom doesn't know what Mary did.
I don't know who's going to be at the meeting.
It's hard to approach the president.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was terribly scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of it right away.
I don't trust her.
Six three is equal to eighteen.
“The Rock” is a “lofty” anagram.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan participated in the anti-racist rally.
You did it fast.
I need to take my watch two minutes ahead.
He's on her side.
I didn't forget your betrayal.
I think you did great.
She danced so gracefully that she surprised us all.
This is where she worked as secretary.
They're not so bad.
I thought I had everything.
Don't worry, it's gonna be okay.
It's hard for me to work with Tom.
I'm competitive.
He says his son can count up to a hundred now.
There's something wrong here.
Tom hates those things.
There's a little garden in front of my house.
Why didn't they go?
I heard you paid someone to do it.
It's for my friend.
Tom said Mary was innocent.
Tulip is the official flower symbol of our prefecture.
I knew we'd be friends.
I didn't want to lose him.
She's at the hotel right now.
I'm gonna give you some karate lessons.
Don't worry about my dog.
Tom's getting cremated tomorrow.
That's not true.
You're not allowed to do this anymore.
On summer vacations in Caruidzawa, tourists swelled.
I saw Tom get on the train.
He didn't do anything wrong.
She's wearing glasses.
I love this ad.
It was just water.
I bought it for my sister.
I'll never forget her and me going to Hawaii.
No one heard the call.
How did this get here?
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to fight.
I'd love to come with you, but I can't.
Shocked by the events of 11 September, the world's politicians condemned terrorists for their despicable actions.
Please call me Taro.
I know both of them.
Don't you want to meet him?
Tom's scared now.
You said it was urgent.
Tom's pretty happy.
I didn't want the same thing to happen to me.
I don't know all the students.
Thank you so much, you just ruined my life!
Civilians were killed.
Tom told me to treat people with respect.
He did what you asked him to do.
Excuse me, where are the eggs?
Peace be upon you.
I'm tired of a white man.
Tom is a violent businessman.
I can't go on Saturday.
We're getting married in October.
Tom and Mary disagree with you.
We'll see you soon.
Let's get divorced.
He won't find any keys.
Her manner of speaking makes me nervous.
Eat what you like.
And then what happened?
Do you think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do this.
He prefers not to talk about it.
I let them sleep until noon.
I just wanted to get back to my old life.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I've already told you everything you need to know.
Health gives you freedom that most people don't realize until they lose it.
Is it important?
I know Tom's secret.
Tom is human.
That's ridiculous.
No one could believe it.
Tell her I'm repairing the refrigerator.
It's not surprising.
The hare is bleeding out of the ear.
Post-technicalism is different from modernism.
I've read this book before.
Damn it!
He shows great enthusiasm.
Maybe you should call the police.
Did you report it to the police?
You really think Tom's sick?
I'm not afraid of that at all.
I don't have as much money as you think.
I'm selling clothes on the Internet.
I could have done it faster when I was weak.
I wasn't worried.
John, the tallest boy in our class, wears the nickname "Mr. High."
Tom's leaving tomorrow morning.
I didn't kill them.
Do you recognize him?
I was, anyway.
Tom has a horse.
I shouldn't have come here.
Don't make such a sour face!
Is it white?
Tom came first.
There were strange rumors about them.
It's incredible.
The sky is covered with clouds.
This bird is endangered.
You gave her a lot of joy.
How are you?
To Tom's eyes, it's not like he's having fun.
I'm fed up.
You said it was important.
He said he'd be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village was calling her green hat.
I don't want to.
It's time for the kids to sleep.
That's a work you can get out of.
I was resting.
Tom won't mind.
There's nothing.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in the corruption of our country's officials.
Did he untie his pants?
I can't distinguish him from my brother.
We can count on him.
I'll go with her.
Did the phone wake you up?
I really need someone to put on.
I don't think Tom has any experience.
Come now.
Last winter, I went to Canada to ski.
It's acceptable.
Tom says he can prove Mary didn't do it.
I was born on January 2, 1968.
I want you to stay away from Tom.
Tom just got out of jail.
The animal entrance is allowed.
Tom's full of hope.
He spoke French as well as, of course, English.
Move that stone from here to there, please.
"That's it." "And who's the lucky woman?"
I've been thinking about you all day.
That's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I impressed him.
The train will be on the station for about two minutes.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
Where do you think it would be safer?
I know your father.
I heard you screaming.
He's the boy who painted this painting.
"Call up" means calling.
Who would notice?
Medicines should be used only at the direction of a doctor.
Do you have a question?
They're in the woods.
I'm talking too much.
You show me the way.
The sun is shining brightly.
The coral reefs are full of life.
Tom said he knew what Mary planned to do.
You never wanted to talk about it.
We hope for the best.
I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
Last night the temperature went below zero.
"You can't wear it." "Why not?"
Tom didn't do well.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
My eyes are the ocean in which my dreams are reflected.
In a big city like Tokyo, I prefer walking rather than driving.
As it turned out here, it's impossible to know.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
Many votes were fabricated.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you right now.
He'll probably be here soon.
He had no idea what a differential equation was.
I know that.
Be grown-up, Tom.
Can you distinguish Tom from his twin brother?
I don't get paid for it.
Tom cut out the chaff boards with his pawn scrap.
Don't hang yourself.
How did you know where Tom was?
She says she'll do it on Monday.
Tom eats too fast.
The popularity of the phone has led to fewer people writing letters these days.
I think we're almost ready.
The wife came to our town three years ago.
Is that why you won't help us?
My pup's dead, and I'm terribly upset.
She's taller than a sister.
I have a pink car.
It's so quiet.
The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest spikes.
You better hide.
Tom should be instructed.
It's just not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What colors do you like?
She says she feels very tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know how Iraq differs from Iran.
That's why they told me not to do it.
Two days ago I caught a cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have some coffee or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
I saw the helicopter myself and I started to wave.
I'm with you.
Do you want to end up like this?
I've been thinking about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
You must protect yourself.
There's no air conditioning in my house.
Tom and Mary study French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his offer.
I admire your courage.
Tom hoped Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do it again.
It's your turn soon, Bashar!
You're useless.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question?
What do you think they'll do to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary does.
I don't want that for anyone.
Tom's gonna be working this weekend.
Tell her I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President ' s attempts to introduce more stringent arms control have been thwarted once and for all by powerful weapons lobbyes.
I think we know each other.
You underestimate Tom.
Don't bother Tom.
I'll try to express it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You've had enough time.
We should have planned more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud my dad's a good cook.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
Thomas tried to explain the situation to Mache.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one paid attention to me.
So at that time there were thirteen.
I'm going to Boston by bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay for it.
Did you make coffee?
You could have told the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Find yourself a decent suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
It's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're bigger than Spartacus!
That's how he used to show off his celebration.
Why did Tom need him?
It's a capital investment.
It's really bitter.
It's not enough time.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network, transfer.
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've read it before.
That's thanks to you.
As long as certain conditions are met.
She's not like everyone else.
Social networks allow you to find a lot of information about the person before you meet him.
What actually happened last weekend in Boston?
What's the point of learning?
These peaches are not very sweet.
I don't think these ink spots can be removed.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me cry.
I can't forgive him lazily.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom was expelled from school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.
Kim's four years older than me.
Why aren't you wearing uniforms?
Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Tom sent her daughter to bed without dinner.
I'm coming with you.
They cleaned the street of snow.
Tom and Mary have to do this together.
They offered to help us.
Tom firmly decided to kiss Machu.
Are you really hungry?
What's gonna happen to him?
Tom and I are friends of the wrong kind.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
Tom is kind of famous.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I saw them all.
As everybody knows, he's a genius.
The picture is hanging on the wall.
Mary said she would win.
I want this dog.
Tom's with you?
The boy's afraid of the dark.
I made him dinner.
Russia has become the second super-Power.
I'm worried about them too.
He went to the post office to send a letter.
Find this powder in a cup of water.
Are you going with her?
Let's take one of those ready-made lunches sold at the station.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in position.
How come you know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop your guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent for an apartment in Manhattan is about four thousand dollars a month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only one who survived.
Are you gonna buy this car?
You sound like my grandmother.
I don't have any siblings.
Let's see something else.
You think that's an accurate translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both wanted to eat.
That's why there's nothing to be done here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You should take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you're tired, sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I have to go on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going for lunch on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
You're not gonna turn off the radio?
I don't remember exactly what Tom said.
Tom's a skilled player.
I wasn't ready.
Look at that girl.
Tom has a living imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you saying?
Yesterday you left the bar just as I was going to give everyone a drink at my expense.
Tom told me it was real working.
I want to play chess.
I support you for a hundred percent.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
You should tell her how you feel.
I have a slight headache.
I heard about what happened.
We rarely have snow here.
Don't open that box.
I hate waiting.
I see him at the club sometimes.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
It was fun yesterday.
Where did Tom get these pictures?
It's useless to panic.
Hey, you know what?
I've been in Boston for three days.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom knocked him down.
Tom tried to prevent Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to do more.
Only you can manage the money.
How does one relate to another?
I was able to do it much faster than Tom.
Don't feed the trolls.
Where did Tom sleep?
I won't tell you.
Why are you still here?
The equator divides the land into two hemispheres.
He's a landman.
I've never seen anything like it.
Trees provide shade.
She was taken with a polycyclist.
Tom doesn't know where it is.
Tom doesn't know where Mary works.
I agreed with Tom.
I have so much to say.
The answer is yes.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
Give me your new address.
Can you see me from there?

You're talking in a dream.
Tom taught Mary how to drive.
I'm just doing what I do.

Do you want to try again?

She agreed with him.
In the next life, I want to be born with a deadly virus.

I always brush my teeth before I go to sleep.
Tom has to tell the truth.
Don't go out in the park tonight!
Tom doesn't use Facebook.
I can't talk about it calmly.
You'll make mistakes.
It's much more expensive.
Most people brush their teeth at least twice a day.
It doesn't matter.
You can always rely on Tom.
These flowers were sent by Tom.
I'm still worried about it.
I was going to a party.
Are you gonna pay in cash?
It's gonna be okay, don't be afraid!
How could you be such a fool?
Are you all crazy?
You should have been there.
My father gave up drinking.
Mary says she has allergies for boys.
You're wrong.
You're the best candidate for this job.
Tom didn't resist the temptation.
Tom didn't want anything to do with Mary.
Ask Tom when he's planning on coming back.
As far as I know, Tom's retired.
Why do people in Australia not walk up their feet?
I doubt Tom and Mary are still home.
I don't want to bother you.
Tom's already in French.
I had a low level of inspiration.
Take your shoes off.
Mary lost her purse.
He was so poor, he had nothing to buy bread.
That made us laugh.
She's already done it.

It's going to depend entirely on Tom.

Tell me you ate for lunch.
Lock him down.
He prayed to God to bless me.
The radio was replaced by television.
This music is very hard for adults to understand.

We have to go.
Tom's gonna give Mary everything she needs.
I'll try luck.
Who started it all?
We don't plan on going together.
His name is Trauma-K-Travel.
It's complicated.
What should be done?
I heard the sky was very beautiful.
Did you get my letters?
Tom told me the joke.
Hi, Mimi, how are you?
I don't have much free money.
I feel sorry for you.
They're idiots.
Heather is a very beautiful girl.
Mary said she was alone.
Tom lost control.
I was mad at myself.
The boys are not afraid of him.
You always call me from her house.
I called him from the hospital.
You're not the same person in life as the picture.
Turn right at the next intersection.
Several students are not available today.
I was afraid of just thinking about it.
My parents are Spanish.
I've known him for years.
Tom asked Mary to turn off the lights.
We'll talk to Tom on October 20.
He only does what I tell him.
I hope Tom gets arrested.
I got in the elevator and I pressed my floor button.
That was promising.
I'm glad to hear that.
How was the night?
My neighbor is a carpenter.
She took off her clothes.
I'll be blind.
I want to go to Hawaii next summer.
That's it!
You don't have that much time.

I don't intend to do that.

I guess I believe him.

Tom was fired because of the charges of sexual harassment.
Don't screw me up.
Tom's got one kid.
I'm ready to help you.
How's your wife, Tom?
We're planning a robbery.
Remove Tom's name from the list.
Tom's not sick anymore.
That's why we have to cut ourselves.
It was dark green.
Tom wasn't stupid enough to say that to Mary.
She told me she didn't eat pork.
Now you can leave the room.
Tom learned a new word.
She spoke French.
I'm glad you're here now, Tom.
Where did she find this book?
Have you received news lately from your sister?
You need breakfast.
So what do you want to know?
Tom didn't go, neither did I.
Choose the expressions.
He just got back.
Mary laughed cheerfully.
You're gonna have to wait here.
I'm tired of listening to your complaints.
Tom and Mary, as usual, lost time.
Please tell them it's urgent.
You'd be great for this job.
How's Tom doing?
We gave her some apples.
I'm not naive.
I didn't tell her you were here.
Can you describe Tom briefly?
I should have told Tom to wait.
Please wish me luck.
I'm glad I'm alive.
Tom was waiting for me in the parking lot.
I didn't want him to cry.
I saw Mary before she saw me.
I'm sorry I told him that.
Tom told me he really wanted to eat.
Maybe I'll never walk again.
Do you know how to pick up Rubik's cube?
My weight is fifty-eight kilograms.
Watch your feet.
Shouldn't we wait for Tom's approval?
I don't want to buy it.
I didn't give Tom anything for Christmas.
I'm an Englishman.
You're not fooling me with this trick.
What kind of sport do you like?
She's reading.
Tom doesn't know why I'm scared.
Go straight along this road.
It's winter soon.
My grandfather was a soldier in the war.
I was there when Tom died.
Did Tom have lunch yet?
You can buy a train ticket.
I'm very proud of my parents.
I've been kidding before.
I don't know if Tom has a bicycle or not.
Don't make me lose my patience.
I love a lot.
I don't think you should do it yourself.
Tom's really dangerous.
It's not his wife.
We're not gonna be there anymore.
How long do I have to wait?
I don't think I need anyone's permission to do it.
I need to find her.
We needed Tom's help.
Breathe through your nose.
Look at it from her point of view.
Tom was the only one who didn't swim.
He's got literary talent.
God can do anything!
Bring the children.
Tom thought you knew Mary.
Tom knew I wouldn't.
I was lucky.
Tom has a bad mood today.
I didn't mean to hurt them.
He looks weird.
Are the victims eating?
I'm wasting a lot of time building air locks.
We all love you.
Here and now.
I'm not really disappointed.
I don't smoke or drink.
She's in charge.
The police haven't questioned Tom yet.
I knew you didn't have enough money.
Critics cannot be avoided.
Please tell me it's not a bomb.
I don't want to bump into Tom.
I went on a train.
I applauded.
I forgot to water flowers.
Tom got the stuff and left.
She's always talking about you.
I respect you and Tom.
I fell asleep on the train.
Tom made his own decision.
I thought you'd be busy.
Can we wait here?
You're impartial.
Tom brushes his teeth at least three times a day.
Tom was good at talking to women.
Let's figure out where we are before we go any further.
She called me the next day.
Tom sold his car to Mary for three hundred dollars.
What did that mean?
You should've told me in advance.
I've got a crossover in my garden.
He's looking for a job.
I'm looking for my cat.
I should have asked her first.
Enjoy for a moment!
Who ate all the cookies?
We'll fix it.
Mary finally found her keys.
This information strengthened him in his opinion.
The worst enemy and the best friend of man is another man.
Tom wanted Mary to get him something to eat.
Don't wait for me to eat.
Tom didn't want to wait.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna take a second.
We didn't ask.
Tom knew what had to be done.
I know it won't happen today.
I don't think it's changing anything.
We had a holiday at the lake.
I didn't know who you were.
She's reading her favorite book.
Tom smiled politely.
Rabbits can swim.
I have some money with me.
Our team has a good chance to win.
One square metre of solar battery produces about one Watt of energy, so it is not easy to use solar energy on a large scale at this time.
Who knows why Tom lied?
This car's new?
I have a question for you.
The train station is ten minutes away.
Who are you to decide?
Swallow the cat.
Tom's a little busy, so he can't help you tonight.
What are your plans for the weekend?
We can be captured.
I'm sure he'll go.
Go and ask him.
Let me see.
Private charity is only a drop in the sea.
I agreed to have a drink with Tom after work.
I wish I had a car like that.
I became a woman.
Tom hasn't slept since the day before yesterday.
Fortunately, Tom had an extra umbrella.
Why did you shave your beard?
These manual items are of different quality.
Tom moved in with Mary.
Tom's not used to doing this kind of work.
She suffers from kidney failure.
Give me the flashlight.
Did you tell him he shouldn't go?
Nothing like ice cream in summer.
I saw her play the piano.
I knew Tom wouldn't.
Do you like driving?
The car didn't move.
Mary knows she was wrong.
That skirt is too tight.
We'll try to keep calm.
Tom's in the park with his friends.
She spoke fast.
So you didn't have to lie to Mary.
The baby's in the cradle.
I didn't tell them you were here.
Tom cut the offer and rewrote it.
You could have hurt yourself.
Get out of this room.
You don't have to smoke while you work.
Tom wanted to play poker with us, but Mary wouldn't let him.
Tom didn't do anything all week just complain about Mary's step.
I think the car's broken enough, I can't do anything with my bare hands.
Did Tom approve?
I'd like to be Canadian.
It only happens sometimes.
We all pray for Japan.
No one wanted to talk about my country.
Just call me.
Why can't you go to Boston?
You're free to do what you want with your money.
Do you want anything?
She left before I got home.
Tom wasn't the only one arrested.
You could at least knock!
You're only doing worse.
I think you should get some rest.
He's a good man.
I cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete the work by next Monday.
I didn't do it very well.
Tom needs you very much.
I appreciate her loyalty.
Papyamento is a beautiful language.
I don't want to cut myself off.
I believe in love at first sight.
Do you remember their names?
I eat cuscus.
I didn't wait for them.
Tom changed his mind.
I'd like to talk to you alone.
I thought you weren't seeing him anymore.
This magazine sells well.
Her clothes attracted a lot of attention at the party.
Tomorrow they're gonna get married.
She was right, and he's wrong.
They were pulling lots to go first.
Maybe we should ask him the way.
Fortunately, it worked.
Tom won't call.
He said he was cold.
I like spending time with friends.
I didn't know you were Canadian.
If you bring the child out and you point his finger at the moon, the child will look at the moon, and if you do the same thing with the dog, she will look at your finger.
Tom took a beer.
Tom didn't want to explain anything.
I'm sure I've never seen her before.
I didn't know who else to call.
I didn't know how unhappy Tom was.
She was born on April 4, 1940.
At the end of this year, there will be an economic crisis.
Don't let anyone go to the fire.
You didn't know them, did you?
Tom showed Mary the letter he got from John.
"The psalms are boring," said the girl.
That's what I want.
Tom used to teach me French.
Where did Tom get that coat?
Don't forget to close the windows.
Can it be acceptable to you?
How am I going to get to work?
Tom says he'll fix it.
I suggest we put a comma here.
This news is new to me.
Tom wants you to help him do this.
She's got a very tense schedule.
Tom also speaks French.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
There were tiger lilys in the garden.
I told her not to do that.
I don't think Tom knows anybody who can do it.
We've come to wish you good luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put toys in a toy box.
I don't want you to go.
He said he'd come.
"Doctor, I'm being ignored."
He's got one purpose in life to make money.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.
You have a letter.
Tom's grandfather couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said she liked him.
Do I have to go with you?
Give him the microphone.
Tom stayed at the hotel.
I explained it to her.
Tom's indecisive.
Jadjon Baton!
I'll postpone my departure if it rains.
It's got to be perfect.
There's something else I want to talk to you about.
This is the tallest building I've ever seen.
It's a rumor to me.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you a musician?
It's been ten years since my mother died.
If you mix the three main colors, you get black.
Take it easy.
When do you want to meet?
She doesn't like the new job.
I didn't want my neighbors to see me naked.
The operation was successful.
How long will Tom be in the hospital?
I want you to stay with her.
I'll make him pay the money.
You have to respect them.
I'm waiting for you in Turin!
You didn't look tired.
I will pray diligently.
What will you do if the war starts again?
Tom said he'd do it, too.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
The most famous gold fever is the California gold fever, which began in 1848.
You know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show me your picture.
I meet new people every day.
I want to go out with him.
You failed Tom.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss Tom terribly.
He told his parents.
Tom, did you eat?
Who did you give it to?
I held him behind his collar.
No one wants you to do this.
I forgot that it was the first April.
Please stop singing this song!
Thomas bit a dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I'm aware of the consequences.
The eastern and western parts of the city are divided into rivers.
Why do you jump?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
That's why you were scared?
Tom invited me to stay for the night.
I don't think Tom's guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do this.
If the ice is heated, it melts.
We could have done it.
The doctor said Tom needs surgery.
I changed my toothpaste recently.
Here's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom is realistic.
Who's knocking on my door?
When and where did you and Tom meet?
I came to visit you.
I feel like an amoeba.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I listened to him.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you cry.
Show me how to do it!
Everyone's silent.
Let the dust settle.
Why are you so stubborn?
He's taught his Chinese teacher, but with all this hormonal work, he's done almost every time he meets.
I'm glad to let you know that I'm fully cured.
I wrote a lot of suggestions on the esperanto.
I like it more than a pastel.
I can't make an exception.
He's quick to think.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I'm my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't pay the bill.
Did you steal it?
She must be angry with me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father likes fishing, just like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan showed up to be a supporter of the white race superiority.
I'll try and distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom is better at cooking than I am.
He swims like an ax.
Tom didn't tell Mary he needed to buy.
She brought meth.
"Tom, hurry." "I'm coming!"
I'm having a big problem.
We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'll try to say it in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to boast about his father's successful car business.
She's wearing sunglasses.
Come on, Emilia, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of a computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Negative minus is positive.
There's a body in the basement.
Please donate.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to say.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the bakery.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're great.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane’s farewell speech made us very sad.
I try not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look grim.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't hold back his smile.
Wait a minute, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is learning that you didn't even know you didn't.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought well before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he won't marry Mary.
I got two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's pale.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come, too?
Does Tom earn enough to live in a city?
The interrogation's over.
Please turn off the radio.
It seemed that he was not sure about his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take your jacket off if it's warm.
There's so many of them.
He could not compromise principles.
Mary says she's alone.
You're probably gonna have three hours to do this.
That was an easy solution.
Mary said she'd be early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
It can be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom has a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I had nothing wrong with my thinking.
Tom keeps his room clean.
Those three books belong to Tom.
He was jumping from one topic to another.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's inside.
It's not cold today.
I mistakenly wore Tom's shirt.
It seems that the bank robbery was planned up to a small amount.
That's why he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Stay a while.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank's empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I bathed in the river.
Tell them to take the phone off.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, right?
Don't make me kill you!
What do you like about this one or this one?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't make us angry.
You don't have to answer.
Tom's got a lot of books.
Can you distinguish the alligator from the crocodile?
Wait, is that what?
My grandfather built this house.
Do you want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
Do you really want me to tell him it was you who killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I have it myself?
The whole nation was touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower this morning?
Okay, everybody, listen to me, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom is my friend.
In the hope of remaining ignorant and free, the nation is counting on things that have never been and will never be.
Tom barely breathes.
Dogs don't recognize colors.
Tom poured water out the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are loyal animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
Two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna give you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than a bad company.
That's the wrong data.
There is a marked difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
I have to tell Tom not to do that again.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's looking.
Come closer.
We're staying at the Hilton Hotel.
So you should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She always complained that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something has to be done.
She gave him a present.
Mary's in her room.
Attention!
I fell in love with that language that very second.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order this pizza?
I need you to help me with that.
Tom is a close friend of mine.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't have gone to the woods alone.
No one sees my tears.
Tom was asleep again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are repeated.
Tom's never been after anyone.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very happy to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five.
We complained to the noise manager at the neighbors.
I won't let you do it.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honesty is one of the virtues.
As soon as you meet a new year, you'll see him.
The library doesn't have a single book in French.
Any synthesis is dangerous, especially.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write it hiragana, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you the way I do.
Be of appropriate age.
Do you know how to juggles?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I don't tolerate animal suffering.
I think Tatoba's slowing down today.
Sally made her brother clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment is a mess.
The conference room is busy.
Potatoes are harmful to your health.
Mys isn't as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's gone.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
You said so many things yourself.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been.
Can't we fire her?
The art satellite was placed in orbit.
I'm totally serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too simple.
What happens to our children if there's a nuclear war?
I told them the bank didn't work.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry for Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know.
Tom didn't tell us why he was so upset.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
You said that last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something.
You don't have anything to hide, do you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account should be paid by the first number of the following month.
My French is terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
To me, Boston is cold, not like Chicago.
Tom was the victim of extortion.
I can't speak for colleagues.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The fight ended with a fight.
I didn't take him, you can check his pockets.
Tom came yesterday.
I'd like to leave it to you.
You chose the wrong man.
They've taken a great risk.
We've got a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home last night?
If anyone can do it, Tom.
The meeting was cancelled because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
On the way, there was a carriage with the mud.
Tom speaks French to his grandparents and English to his parents.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom was hard to find.
Everybody dances!
I live with Tom.
I met them here.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is you don't have patience.
Several events marked the twenty-first century.
Stop doing that, Tom.
Tom said he didn't plan on doing that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said there's no way to talk about it.
He got out of bed.
Trains follow schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think it's impossible to get confused in languages.
Why does Tom avoid me?
Is the exam going to be today?
What motivates you?
I gave Leila my own computer.
Roll up your sleeve.
I was hoping you'd come back.
You think Tom's gonna agree to meet us?
It's said that anyone in America could become president, but that's probably not the case.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom's name.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
What time does the train arrive?
How long does this train arrive in Boston?
Have you seen that?
You need to call me.
Tom never suspected Mary and John were dating each other.
When I'm rich, I'll buy a farm.
I made him a cookie.
It's a neighboring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Please translate it into French.
Take the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd grew rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me about what happened.
Cosie and run.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She's loved by everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's.
Tom has a weak heart.
That's why I'm gonna have to pay for her.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me your pocket knife?
Tom took off his overhead beard.
Have you seen my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
No one saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to come back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally managed to do that.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test's easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know which book to pick.
Tom didn't understand anything.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
It's a tower.
I'm gonna have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Anyone here with them?
They're watching you.
How long do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He's aware of his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's wearing a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There are many broad avenues in this city.
What are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't make the people do this.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand the color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still single.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
Our neighbors complained against us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never spoke to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She's got shortcomings.
I wonder why Tom should do this.
It seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only one here from Boston.
Will you support me?
Why don't you like the plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready for fun?
You're a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter's about to end.
Titles and rewards mean nothing to me.
Where did you even find him?
It's been a long time.
I'll recognize you.
Did you have a good weekend?
Tom drinks beer.
You don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is this good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Pull yourself together!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we're lost.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude conduct.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his home.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he was living in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I'm connecting you to her.
She got the highest grades.
Tom might surprise you.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you associate with your childhood?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do this.
I was a little scared.
Tom used a hollow jack.
I'd like to lie down.
Get me some notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV this evening, I don't want to leave home.
He'll be here today.
Cat's dead.
It's only half-nine now?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's not safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have dinner with me tonight.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She put herself on her hands to warm them up.
Tom said he was glad you came back.
My car's covered with pigeon shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door locked.
Lori's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I won't make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I convinced her to marry him.
I've been waiting all my life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane went into a mess.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any correspondence friends in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary fainted.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read that book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do that for you.
"Hi," said Tom.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how long it is.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of vehicles passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the pricer.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new offer as a message in a bottle: one day it'll be translated.
You're not gonna find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
He and I are related souls.
I have a grandson of your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is this a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
It started to develop in its new office.
Let us take care of it.
I believe you're sitting in my seat.
I planned to do it last night.
It's a little early to drink alcohol, isn't it?
My parents don't like my manner of dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him ensnared and badly.
Because it's worse?
It's not expensive.
Can I have your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't lie down all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about kissing.
The series needs to start watching when all the seasons are taken off!
Road accidents occur daily.
Where did you go skiing?
You were in a hairdresser's office?
The prospect is disappointing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ball pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Run away.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed my exam.
Everyone knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
They're coming, too?
She's sleeping like a baby.
Tom forgot to let go of the brake.
That song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The whole building was shaken by the explosion.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged her.
It's my cat.
Do you already have kids?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
Tom likes them.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a presumptuous idiot.
It keeps me awake at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I'm guessing you need some help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks it's a sin to throw away food.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about this yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it at all.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom wiped the whisky.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
I haven't met him better.
How much did he cost?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I was before.
You know the boy who's crying?
Nobody knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
The robber will steal the cow.
Tom doesn't swim well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was nothing but a shadow of what he used to be.
How are we doing this?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us next week to Boston.
Don't let them in.
Everything happens.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm just a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily in his lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I should stay together.
I've only heard about him well.
I'm not working here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't compare to us.
I saw the car explode.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw away my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's case's empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll lose.
I love going to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son from me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see a volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell him I'm gonna come to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't mean to bother him.
The officer instilled courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about testing things like this.
I don't know much about hunting.
It's the first time I've made meat in the house.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do it?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everybody knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driver's license.
I cut myself every month.
I told you I didn't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's a sour apple.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Are you taking a job at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus stole sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All the passengers managed to get out of the bus before it set fire to fire.
I want to help you figure this out.
You speak French better than I do.
There's a lot of talented people in our city, but Tom doesn't belong to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We accept checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars were dying in the night sky.
I doubt Tom's gonna win.
"Oh, you're so bored." "My dear boy, everyone wants to go to this world" -- "Here I am, "Your Majesty, Hanon and his servants have seized Coridai Island." -- "Hmm. How can we..." -- "How is it written that Link only can conquer Hanon." -- "So good, I'll grab my sword" -- "Aaah? " " " "--no, no, no, no! "" -- "That's a gun with a skull" -- "No." -- "How about "ah, my father" -- "No?" -- "How about the smoke bombs?" -- "No?" -- "No." -- "Oh no, how the hell does that gun?
Do you know who sings this song?
Are your watch coming right?
I'll see you Sunday at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're good at this.
I met her on my way home from school.
I didn't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn to read.
I'm heading to Tom's house.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed money.
Tom helped Mary lay the blankets.
A is a variety of elements (c), (b) and (a).
I'll be back by nine.
He's got diabetes.
We can deal with them.
I was just wondering if you had any experience you'd like to share with us.
Tom slept without blankets.
Pray for us.
What kind of music are you listening to in the car?
I was told that three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French Revolution began at the time of Louis XVI's reign.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to bathe in the sea.
This will depend entirely on him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our town was surrounded by a force of power.
No one saw them leave the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, food is not food.
It's snowing tomorrow.
You should've quit smoking a long time ago.
Stop joking!
Some of my classmates are full of nuba, they don't know anything about computers.
Did you like your bike?
I thought Tom was awake.
So we weren't allowed to leave.
I didn't find them right away.
Hurry up, please, Tom's waiting.
Listen to what the teacher says.
She looks amazingly like Marilyn Monroe.
I know where we can turn for help.
I'm stronger than you.
She felt deep regret as she looked back on her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
I swear I didn't see her.
I really loved him.
Tom and I were in agreement.
In politics, respect is hard to earn, but it is easy to lose.
Stop acting like a child!
Let's go.
They're beginning to believe their own lies.
Don't pick him up.

She's out of her mind and screaming at me.
Did you take your drug?
Bunnys are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time's on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Did you want to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still angry.
You'll be better this morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell the fuel rubber?
This isn't what happened here.
When will your father come home?
I understand.
Tom pulled out Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my soul.
Tom's got a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom will try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's snooping.
Tom said it's not enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring a salad to the party.
Her hair's wet with sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it weighs?

I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already talked to this student.
What chemical sign is methyl hydrochloric acid?
We've got a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
So we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do that.
That's cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a butler.
I respect his views, although I do not agree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the center of town.
Who sent you?
She tied him up with a sweater.
I don't think Tom would want to come with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine calling cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her not.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
Are you planning on staying for long?
We had a quick drink and left immediately.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't put anything on your feet.
Start every meal with soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right across from me.
The purse was opened.
I brought some wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you to death.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he's not sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
Apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
Is she singing?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Thomas?
Let's drive.
You're interrupting me.
She wondered what his lips would taste like.
A good coach trains this team.
The tree's sick.
The train was detained because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
Why do you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you have eaten?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning to do it or not.
I'm falling.
I was unable to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom wears new shoes.
Last year she learned how to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go outside.
When I was walking down the street, I saw a friend of mine.
How many houses are there on your street?
Elephant tusks are made of ivory.
I'm no longer a child.
"How's life, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
Her mother tongue is French.
It's a sick coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married at the time.
I bought this book.
Naivism is its only positive quality.
My hobby is insect collection.
Tom lived in Boston as a kid.
I haven't eaten for six days.
Can I tell them that?
She kept quiet all day.
No matter what he says, don't believe him.
I'm gonna go on.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.

I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under the cradles.

What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry to upset you.
He who has never left his country is full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it is when the snow falls.
Tom is helping the wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I got my imagination on.
I thought we could do it.
My mom was against me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
You know what you're doing, don't you?
The machine translation can't be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
The river is full of fish.
His success was nothing more than a miracle.
She and I are peers.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had any of these symptoms?
The prisoner is released.
What, did they say happened?
Could you leave the door open?
We're gonna have to wait with that.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice as old as me.
Tom knows what he made was a mistake.
In Japan, the climate is soft.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced the injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
The trip was very smooth.
It's inevitable that one day I'm going to France, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom just pretends to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain stopped, we could open the windows again.
I've never had this before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going out when the phone rang.
I don't have to put up with it.
Always take the road easy on the right.
We're asked to introduce ourselves in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can drop you if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
You still got a problem with this?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I don't really have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's a covered book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about it.
You have nothing to be sorry about.
She's my lover!
The sound of your voice is like a melodious song of sirens to me.
What's it like to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?

If I had time to do it, I'd do it.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Thomas big?
This medicine will help you.
Stop making noises.
My stomach hurts.
You know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I don't have anyone to trust.
She's a fan of Sex in the Big City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do that?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing compares to a cup of beer after a long day's work.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.

What do we live for?
Will it rain this afternoon?
We know about her.
You could've helped us.
I don't often drive a car.

I'm sick of both of you.
I didn't know it was legal.
I like adventures.

You were in school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.

It's your fault that this happened.
It's like a watch.
I know where you're going.
You're taking it all over the summer.

The best defense is the attack.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it'd be easier.
Is there anything we can do to help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
Investigations began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's it going?
