The FANO of Russia will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) will co-host the third Expert Session “Assessing the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be the final part of the Agency's series of meetings during the year, as reported in a press release from Lenta.Ru.
It is planned that the third meeting will take stock of the results of the Expert Session in the year and form a final list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
The participants are planning to discuss the rules for the establishment of expert groups responsible for the assessment of the work of scientific groups and the criteria for the conduct of assessments.
The third expert session will conclude with a series of events aimed at developing a common approach for all three academies to the assessment of the performance of scientific organizations.
We have done so over the past five months, and the final version of the normative documents is in agreement.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the science-based and expert analysis processes, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment,” said Helen Axenov, director of the Russian Federation's FANO Analysis and Evaluation Office.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred Russian scientific institutions.
As a result, the resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014: Moscow City, Solyanca Street, House 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect the birth stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied the disturbing confusion and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow for the exploration of the stars, i.e., those arising from a single cluster.
The results of their studies were published in Nature magazine and are briefly available on the university website.
The same chemical composition of the nearest stars is due to the disturbing mixing of gas in the clouds prior to the formation of the stars.
Even if a born star then leaves a star cluster, its chemical composition can determine its birthplace and region of origin.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of the star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
Astrophysics simulation results show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, specialists using a supercomputer simulated two streams of interstellar gas that together formed clouds.
This object is transformed into a cluster within a few million years under its own gravity, where proto-stars begin to form.
Scientists added color labels to the original gas streams and found that rapid confusion in the cloud was achieving a high degree of chemical uniformity.
Astrophysicists believe that their research proves that it is possible to search for chemically based stars and to identify possible regions of such objects.
Carrata police arrested 20 years after a high speed motorcycle was chased
The motorcycle was confiscated after being driven 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through the Bushland to escape from the Pilbar police.
A transport police patrol in Carrat this morning tried to stop the blue motorcycle, discovering that it had a speed of 125 km/h when it left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police report that the rider did not stop and continued his movement on Burgess Road, then turned him over to Bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
The motorcycle and the person who described the driver were seen near the house on Walcott Way in Bulgar.

Lavrov: Russia will not “knob the door” in connection with new sanctions and will not withdraw from WTO
Russia will not “knob the door” in connection with the new sanctions.
This is what the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, said today, speaking to students and teachers of the MGIMO.
With regard to our response to a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything must be specifically calculated,' he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will like this time, then we will decide how to respond.
It's not going to be about slamming doors, some kind of insult that's misinterpreted,' the Minister stressed.
Above all, we will be driven from our interests, from our interests, from the interests of protecting our economies, from the social sphere, from our citizens, from our business, and will draw conclusions from the actions of our partners with regard to their adequacy, coherence and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions can be very well judged by the partners, as continued by the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
If they say they're gonna hurt us too, but we have to do it to punish Russia, that's probably not good enough.
With regard to WTO, the Russian Federation was not responding to possible new sanctions.
On the contrary, we want to learn more about WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes, said Lavrov.
We have already used this tool to overcome what we consider to be a discriminatory EU policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia has been accused of dumping and anti-dumping measures have been taken against the sectors of the economy of the Russian Federation.
“We are prepared to use WTO mechanisms and to defend our position that the third EU energy package should not be applied retrospectively,” said Lavrov.
How can we use sirens properly in the design of the garden?
Irina Okuneva answers:
Since sirens lose their primary appeal after blooming, it is desirable to plant them together with other shrubs.
It is beautifully combined with many cultures.
It is also possible and necessary to plant plants that are decorative at other times and that are also flowering at the same time.
Another plus of the siren is that it provides a lot of creative opportunities.
You can form it into a stub tree of different heights, an improved bush, a wide - base bush, and even a garden bonsai tree with a curiously curved barrel.
Just choose a form that fits your garden design more closely.
In Carelia, a Leningrad resident was convicted of selling counterfeit money
According to the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his own criminal activities in Oluntsk and Ségezh district.
In addition to Karélia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already been succeeded in inheriting the Volodol region, where he was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment this spring.
Later, the man appeared before the Holonet District Court.
In order to complete the investigation into the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Ségeja.
In the course of the investigation, several episodes of counterfeit money relating to the summer of 2013 were proved guilty.
At the end of June of this year, the criminal case file with the indictment was referred to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court decided to replace the term of imprisonment with four years ' service in a general regime colony.
The sentence has not entered into force.
Recall that during the past week, two other counterfeiters were convicted of having been paid for them at Petrozadsk shops.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Kareliya from St. Petersburg.
One is deprived of liberty for five years, the other for four years.
Each was fined 500,000 roubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
In Archangelsk, we celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Derwish".
The rally, held at the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Derwish delivered military assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom to the USSR.

The event was attended by representatives of Veterans ' organizations, Archangelsk, children of the Kadet class.
For the first time, we met twenty-three years ago when a stone was laid.
But, at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those whom the sea did not return," said the chairman of the North Sea Park Veterans Council, Boris Carp.
Then, at the event, the city’s orchestra performed, and the teachers of the Edith classes gave the veterans flowers and marched with the Russian flags and the victory sign.
The rally ended with the putting of flowers on the bedstone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped boots, tin, wool and many other equipment and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were also on board: 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Harrikin fighter aircraft, in disassembled condition.
At the same time, the escort was made up of 16 British Navy ships, including two aircraftmen.
The caravan of the ships was not found by the enemy and reached the point of destination, Archangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 vehicles and about 50 warships were killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis have proposed a bill on which trade union organizations are protected as civil law.
"Where trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, a democracy from Minnesota, who is co-chair of the Congress of the Progressive Faction.
That's why I'm proud to present the Employee Empowerment Act with the civil rights movement symbol John Lewis.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade union organizations as other forms of discrimination by halting the forces of opponents of trade unions
The amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to enable workers facing discrimination for participation in trade union organizations to seek justice before civil courts, and to receive compensation for damages and fines, a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis and the co-sponsors of the bill are to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks by trade unions in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding and respecting labour rights.
There was a time still remembered by millions of Americans when the country was at the same time defending democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that Hideki Todzie's paramilitary autocracy had been replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in forming a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate and to act collectively”.
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler had been replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and to every profession or activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to undermine this right will not have legal effect; measures to that effect will be considered illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, which will be adopted by the United Nations as a world agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions for the sake of his own interests”.
For generations, Americans have adopted as a valid basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to establish civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions — and that the trade union should be an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government institutions — must be protected.
At a time when these rights are being attacked in America, it is indeed wise to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the nation's power, but has increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions have miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how we should be.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights, and the expansion of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions, is long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are reviving ideals that historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge temporarily blocks a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the implementation of the Louisiana Act on Sunday, which his supporters say he is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Louisiana Bobby Ginadl in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to receive patients from a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision meant that doctors could continue to perform legal abortions to date, continuing to seek such powers.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally for the continuation of their powers”, wrote Judge John DeGrewells in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month when the judge will render a more permanent decision on the law.
The defenders of the right to abortion were pleased to see this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
“The present decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from a treacherous law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights”, said Nancy Northap, President and Head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a motion to suspend the law from the presence of three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who were not applicants in the case and also applied for admission authority.
Louisiana is located in 11 States that have enacted such laws and the courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on admission powers impose restrictions on doctors not necessary for medical purposes.
Opposers to abortion object that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive impact on the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who has abortions in Louisiana has a hospital admission authority, reported to the Reproductive Rights Centre.
If all the rest of the medical staff in the state were to stop doing this procedure, the doctor would, for fear of his safety, stop carrying out the procedure, as reported by the team.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for decision-making powers were pending.
The introduction of quotas on domestic products will result in what
At least half of the products for each type of product in the trade chain should be Russian production, according to Member of the State of State of the Fair Russia faction, Oleg Nile.
A bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers has been prepared by the parliamentarian and is published in the newspaper Izvedia.
The document will be detailed in order to avoid possible discomfort to the buyers.
For the rest of the product groups produced in Russia, the Riteler will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers,” reported Neil to the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article on the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation, the bill provides for the amendment of the Tax Code, which establishes a reduction of 10 per cent for the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota in trade networks is part of a stimulus package for Russian producers.
A few times as many domestic products will be available at the counters.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, say the experts.
According to a lawyer for Natlovik, a member of the Public Duma Independent Expert Centre, Sergei Litwinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
It's going to be agricultural producers, farmers, small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means the profits will grow.
In addition, they will be entitled to dictate their terms and prices to the Ritellers, since they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, resulting in higher taxes than before.
This will increase the income of the budget, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some more rapidly, contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will be reduced several times, but not immediately,” the expert notes.
In the past, Russian enterprises were often unable to break through local store counters because of the high competition of foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been released and can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that, after all the necessary agreements and health checks, the Russian market will receive food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.
In other words, it's now a moment of silence, when the old players are gone and the new ones are gone.
After almost a month, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the rising prices of finished products,” AIF.ru explained the first Vice-President of the Russian-wide public organization “The Russian Financial Directors' Club”, C.E. Tamara Kasyanova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category would make it possible to secure the sector for local producers.
In such a case, they will compete with each other rather than with goods that are less expensive through subsidies from another State.
In other words, the buyer will be fought between companies operating under the same industry laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of their compatriots in many ways.
In this situation, trade networks will have to “strip up” the share of Russian goods to half the range.
There is a growing fear that poor goods will be placed on the counters.
Perhaps foreign products with broken labels will be produced in Russia,” adds the expert.
The negative effects of quotas will be felt by major trading networks, especially those that benefit from cooperation with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer under this arrangement, as demand for their products will decline.
Litwinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods can affect consumers as well.
The point is that some Russian products may be inferior to imported counterparts, while shops may be able to raise prices for second products as scarce goods.
The idea of importing economics in the early 2000s was once again raised by economists in February this year because of the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
In the face of difficult relations with the West, the issue of non-importing of imported products is becoming even more urgent.
The law is intended to require Ritellers to treat suppliers with domestic producers when making orders.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the way to import, and a system of product planning will be established in a shorter time frame,” says Deputy Oleg Neil.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the milk industry, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are truly capable of fully covering Russian shops.
In addition, meat production can generate strong momentum.
It is known that the largest share of imports is for beef, between 30 per cent and 35 per cent.
It turns out 65-70% are Russian products," Kasianova says.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas on domestic products will facilitate import substitution and may accelerate this process.
However, this initiative does not in itself lead to import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, and is confident that Lithuania will do so.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative could still be imported from abroad, and thus no full import would take place, but significant steps would be taken in that direction.
Moreover, quotas were not enough, and domestic production was still needed in order to meet those quotas.
The quota will provide such guarantees,” notes the expert.
Early diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother, James, published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Rural women in Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than urban women.
Researchers analysed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after the diagnosis was made.
A leading researcher, Susan Jordan of the Institute of Medical Studies, QIMR Bergofer, reported that those living in regions and remote states were 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those living in urban areas.
RESEARCH: New drugs can slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers have followed the medical path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the existence of current diseases and socio-economic status also had an impact on the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancers at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote states, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside cities were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecological oncology, and they're mostly in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedical services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would allow women to be treated closer to home and programmes to support people receiving treatment away from their home might help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tino Rede to Conquer sectionr will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank, Elise Nev, said that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
A new FAA will open the door in the Kugener area in September.
The construction of a health facility in the village of Tokaibelac was initiated in April this year and was carried out on a model project.
The cost of work was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Office of Public Relations and Information, Head Mary El, funding for the construction of the facility was financed by the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the facility is almost 230 square metres.
It will provide health care to the population of eight settlements: Tokybelak and Dementievo, Puncherumal, Tunja, Fomichi, Toraybelak, Shinar and Chascal.
The new health centre will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long been exhausted and its premises do not meet sanitary requirements.
A new institution will be opened shortly.
Killing a four-month-old son in a state of acutely newcomer will be brought to justice
The woman of Chuwasa will be on the dock of the defendants for killing her own child.
In Cheboksarah, the criminal investigation was completed against a 31-year-old woman, Novacheboksarsk, accused of causing death due to negligence.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year the accused, together with the four-month-old son, arrived to celebrate the birthday of the child of their kuma in Cheboxar.
After a long pause, the newcomer decided to stay in the house and put the baby to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, the impregnated woman put him next to her bed to feed her breast but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman attacked her son and died of suffocation.
The criminal case is referred to the U.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.R. for Chuwasa.
Inflation's out of leave.
Does Russia feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of the cross-border sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and fail to meet the expectations of the authorities, convinced by BTB Capital.
In the view of the experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions would lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, says RBC Daily.
According to the latest Mineconomy forecast, inflation will be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014 and less than 6.5 per cent in next year.
However, according to the Commersant newspaper, this week the IRE should make “small but principled” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could lower its inflation estimates for 2015, which would eliminate the expected underdevelopment of the incomes of the population.
It was predicted that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation were in force for a year, until August 2015.
How could such inflation be assumed?
The current situation is a one-off shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change," said a source of the newspaper in Minffina.
Economists from WTB Capital do not share the Government's expectations for inflation and predict price increases of 8 per cent in 2014.
The main effect of the product bans will be, together with the possible introduction of a sales tax (SN tax) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, convinced experts.
Inflationary peaks of 9 per cent will have to be achieved by February, followed by annual price increases, by experts.
By the way, last week Rosstat summarized the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed “cautious sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed the experts and clarified their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the CC AForex Analysis Department:
Price increases are already taking place in the main segments of the product.
Moreover, when socially significant products were valued, the Government was forced to initiate systematic price stability monitoring measures in order to avoid the risks of undue price increases in the short term.
Vendors and Ritellers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and why the price increases are initiated.
The major factors contributing to the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rate of capital outflow, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-guarantor, internal conversion due to the population ' s flight to foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food products from the countries that have acceded to the sanctions against Russia.
If the inflation pressure remained under control, the cost of the minimum package basket would not have jumped 12 per cent per quarter.
The ban on the import of food products has given rise to a shock of supply on the domestic market and has led to an entirely logical increase in final value.
As we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import and increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production at the current stage, the sanctions will continue to carry the risks of growth of the inflation component.
Add to this the fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in national currency and the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Raviwaev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
Inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month in the 1990s, zero was also above current levels, another case that was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think inflation will be 8-8.5 per cent at the end of the year.
Plato Maguta, the asset manager of the UK "Maguta Foundation"
The external factor associated with the sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully contained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, particularly on the financial sector, this may lead to certain difficulties and inflationary expectations of the population, which are traditionally expressed in the purchase of the cash currency in order to secure their savings.
It may be assumed that the Government, the CBF and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth erosion of the ruble, both through market methods and through government regulation.
But price increases are traditionally beginning after summer’s eclipse and may become more visible in the fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5 per cent is likely to last because the Russian Federation has more financial savings.
Gardening centres mourn the decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, caused by the exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, may result in horticultural centres losing tens of millions of pounds per year when today's young consumers reach the “main age of horticulture”, according to the HTA study reported by Financial Times.
According to the report, people who rent houses spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that homeowners spend on gardening.
It refers to the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting in front of the parking yard and the reduction of the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, whose annual sales are estimated to be five billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, Britain’s lowest level of expenditure on household gardeners was spent.
HTA and Royal Gardening Society reported that renting housing and the lack of garden space did not mean that humans could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser at RHS, said, "The growing of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the golden age of retail trade in horticultural goods as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather following the adverse conditions last March and April.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out a massive cleansing of the Lands Foundation.
Three of the four heads of the Landedela Foundation were replaced on Friday.
A total of three of the four heads of the Landedela Foundation were replaced on Friday.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria officially reported only the removal of the Executive Director, Atanas Joeva.
Lausan Vasileva took his place.
It turns out that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund were changed in a quiet manner on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatyana Angelov, who had been responsible for the State assistance and SAPARD programme until then, was released, reported to BGNES with reference to the newspaper Trud.
I didn't attend the fund board because by law we weren't members of the administration, but I was informed later that I was released.
I cannot say why my dismissal is not reported on the Fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I know more on Monday," said Angelov.
It will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatov, who has so far been the head of the Investment Credit Fund at the Landela Central Fund in Sofia.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nicolai Dachev, was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for EU fields.
He will be appointed Zhliko Zishkov, who was the head of the Regional Directorate of the Landedela Foundation in the city of Greato-Tirnovo until January 2014.
Only Deputy Chief of the Atije Alieva-Veli Foundation retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey summons an American diplomat in connection with a report on espionage
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on the American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent reported that an American attorney and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet journal The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for American and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news agencies, the Turkish President, Rejep Taip Erdogan, downgraded the importance of this report by saying that all the major countries were spying one after the other.
Previously reported information that the main intelligence agency of Germany had also made Ankara a subject of exploration has given rise to a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
China's largest companies are united against Alibaba
China's companies, including the largest commercial real estate dealer in China, the Danish Wanda Group, and the Internet gigagons Tencent Holdings (scissors, Messinger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alabama.
But catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which even left its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com behind, will not be easy.
Union of the Major
Companies plan to invest 5 billion Yuan ($814 million), 70 per cent will be owned by Wanda and 15 per cent by each of the Internet companies, says Wanda Group.
The company is scheduled to register in Hong Kong.
JS will combine Baidu's search services with the popular WeChat (the largest social network in China, with some 438 million users), Tenent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, the Wanda group manages at least 49 commercial real estate facilities throughout China and 40 shopping centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a thematic entertainment park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors per year and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda is owned by the American AMCOK Holdings Network, which makes the company the world's largest camera operator.
By 2015, Wanda planned to provide all its shopping centres, hotels and entertainment sites for e-commerce services, which would be developed by an Aliba competitor.
According to Dun Que, who will lead a new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-Commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by the following year.
The new site should be the world's largest online-to-offline platform, notes Don Ze.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) is to attract buyers on the Internet to come to conventional off-line businesses or to buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sale of coupons such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the largest pie in online commerce,” said Wanda Van Jianlin (Bloomberg Citate).
“There is now no real O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances are roughly equal for everyone,” he believes.
China's Internet Trade Market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will be more than tripled by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, with official statistics being provided by the Floomberg: this is more than the population of any country in the world, except India.
And it is projected that by 2015, that number could have grown to 850 million.
Union of the Richest
The head of Tenent Ma Huathen until recently was China's richest man, but according to the Bloomberg millionaire index, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already overrun it by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is in the Aliaba.
The leader of Baidu Robin Lee is now ranked third among the richest people in China, while Van Jianlin of Wanda is fourth in rating.
"This battle is very interesting to observe: the three richest people are working together to challenge the even richer," said Bloomberg, director of China's e-commerce research centre in Hanzhou Tzao Lai.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba once it's created: "Rome cannot be built in one day."
The fact that it is not easy to compete with Alibaba not only new companies but well-deserved leaders of the world's Internet trade is evidenced by the report published the previous day on the financial performance of Alibaba in the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as the average between eBay and Amazon.com, but between April and June, the Chinese company earned more than both its American competitors combined.
The net profits of Alibaba over the period are almost twice that of the same sum of competitors, which has increased almost threefold annually to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has enormous potential for generating money, largely thanks to his mobile applications," commented Bloomberg on an analyst's report from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba website of the United States Security and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company ' s services in July was 188 million, significantly above the March 163 million.
However, 32.8 per cent of all transactions by Alibaba over the past quarter involved mobile devices.
The value of its shares in front of IPO is to be stated by Alibaba.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company could be estimated at $187 billion after selling shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, the Aliba debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NISE) could be held as early as 16 September.
The company that preceded this event will start on 3 September.
It is expected that the IPO output of Alibaba will be the record in the history of NYSE and that it will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
To date, the U.S. exchange rate has been recorded as belonging to the Visa payment system, which initially located its shares in 2008 at $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food items in the trade networks should be Russian production, as members of the State.
They have drafted a bill on this subject.
This is to amend article 8 of the FZ on the basis of the State regulation of trade in the Russian Federation and the Tax Code.
The aim of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, of at least 50 per cent of domestic products produced in shops must be for each type of product.
However, the document will bear in mind that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in the winter, so they will be given a "severe" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Code of Taxes of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduction of 10 per cent for the sale of all food products of which Russia is the country of origin, as reported in the newspaper History.
On 27 August, a draft law amending the Retail Markets Act was introduced to the lower chamber of Parliament, which proposes the re-establishment of farmers' markets in Russia in which small producers can carry out their products.
Chief of Police Magaluf is charged with corruption
The plaintiffs provided evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Kalwia to the Malorki Public Prosecutor's office on Friday.
The head of the California Police on Malorca resort was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the scandalous Magalouf concentration centre.
The Chief Inspector, José Antonio Navarro, was detained as a result of allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's daily online release, the complainants submitted evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of California to the Malorki Anti-Corruption Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by Spanish National Guard guards for allegations of corruption and will be interrogated by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that the disgruntled owners of nightclubs said that protectionism on the part of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving," said one businessman to the court.
Our sources of existence cannot be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magalouf was in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer who passed 24 men in a bar run.
The island authorities have since tried to stop bullying among the rest of the Magaluf while minimizing the number of scandalous alcohol races in the bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the carnage bar organizers were combined fined for €55,000 ($73,000).
The Magalouf tourist resort, mainly popular among young British vacationers, has also been the scene of numerous alcohol-related accidents associated with crazy fun known as balconing, where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcon to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and wind conditions that affected flights to Adelaide Aeroport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in southern Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Aeroport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9: 00 p.m., after 6.6 mm, which fell during the night of Sunday.
The last of the rains was preceded by a pair of short downpours with an ebbing wind, including a storm that started shortly before 8 p.m. and poured out almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter gave off the early spring season last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The school conditions were believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in landing the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land on the schedule just after 7:30 p.m., but it got into the wind shift zone -- the sudden change in speed or the direction of the wind at a short distance -- and was forced to gain height.
The winds reached 50 km/h on the ground at the Aeroport of Adelaide at that time.
The flight showed that the plane had to gain height during the second landing, and the aircraft eventually landed about 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two showers.
The calculation of the estimates of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The Federal Antimonopoly Service has special control over pricing, regulation of the construction industry and connectivity.
The FAS has established an expert board on building competition.
At its meeting, the Head of the Office for Control, Construction and Natural Resources of FAS, Wadim Soloviev, stated that “the current calculation of the estimates of construction facilities is completely unclear”.
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and may lead to undue construction costs, considered by the FAS.
And it is suggested that the cost of building public facilities at the design stage should be determined on the basis of market prices for constructive solutions rather than today's estimated standards and unit costs for technological transactions.
These proposals have been incorporated into the road map and are currently under consideration in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“The replacement of traditional estimates of construction documents for design elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” explained Vadim Solovev, “WGB”.
It's not always possible to verify everything, and sometimes unfair construction companies may bury “whole tractors” in the documents.
I agree with FAS in the ministration.
“The first work on the cost-sharing shift for design elements is already under way: methodologies have been developed to calculate the prices of design decisions, to estimate these indicators,” explained KGB to the head of the Department of Urban Development and the infrastructure of the Elena Zhukov Mint.
Road construction is selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
The head of the Profi-Investment construction company Anatoly Demianco told GTB that the estimates were long outdated, but no other business mechanism has yet been proposed.
“As for the proposed design element calculations, this is difficult in practice, as the construction of buildings often uses very different technologies,” he said.
It's not a secret that the construction industry develops largely through the State order.
In the opinion of the Chairman of the NP, Ekaterina Lézyna, the “Expert Community of Professionals of the State of the State”, is now the most solvent employer.
The Deputy Director of Engineering, Rosatom Vladimir Malakov, Industrial Centre for Capital Construction, noted that today the market is tentatively divided into companies with access to a portfolio of contracts and companies with monopoly competences and no competitors.
He believed that the establishment of a transparent market was possible only if access to contracts was maximized by someone in charge.
The expert board was requested to establish a system of State orders in such a way that the same perpetrator could not receive more than one contract worth more than one billion rouble or several contracts worth more than one billion rouble.
The Ministry believes that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of the impact on business as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As Elena Zukowa explained, this would require that the employer be assigned the functions of a gender contractor, resulting in an increase in the number of clients and the budget for its maintenance.
In doing so, customers will need to have knowledge to assess the quality of the works performed by the contracting organizations and their safety.
Often, with such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the departure of highly qualified participants in State procurement due to the lack of interest in receiving a State-owned order for part-time work and a small contract.
The co-chairs of the procurement centre of the Institute of Procurement, Alexander Eustashenko, believe that the State order procedure has now become a business game for the attention of the contractor.
The example is: “a participant should specify “specific indicators” without specifying the words “or equivalent”, “must be”, “must be”, “be on”, “be on,” “be on,” “be on,”, “analog,” “or”, “type”, “not below”, “below”, “be on,” “may”, “may have”, “may be”, “may not be on earlier,” “not earlier”, “not earlier”, “not permitted”, “not permitted”, etc.
Employers thus often abuse their right to require the contents of an application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Eustasvenkov, was the need to assess the quality of the work at the application stage through the participant's paper proposal.
In considering the application of the participant, only the skills of the contractor, but not the quality of the work that had not yet been done, could be effectively assessed, the expert believed.
The quality of work can only be assessed if it is accepted.
The expert board was also requested to transfer the margin income from the upper to the lower echelon to allow intermediate contractors to disappear.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, CEO of FAS, Andrey Kingi, believes that this should not be done, since it is the responsibility of the generator to be responsible for the order.
Or else it'll be like the famous Rykin's Arcadia "Atel" retraction: "There's a claim for Puggies?"
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza Strip war
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories close to the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday, after spending the summer in shelters, when missiles and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the area recovered after the fighting.
The beginning of the school cycle brought joy and excitement to the missile-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the signs of fighting remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the Pasosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed fragments of fragments from the walls and children's mountains before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're happy to look to the future," said Ronette Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to come back to a meaningful life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly she started going back to school "a little weird."
"There was a hard time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Raven Rivlin visited Kibbutz, near the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of people living on the border, such as Sa ' ad, did not go outside or leave their homes, leaving for safer areas away from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, settlements near the Gaza border, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a piece of Palestinian mine, doubt their need to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which had been severely affected by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, "We will do our utmost to provide you with knowledge and safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained, such as Hamas ' s demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians, three quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, were killed in the war, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militia; however, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting Hamas and other Gazan fighters fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed by Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools, which have been turned into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fighting continued, education officials delayed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon open up so that we can complete our education like children from all over the world and Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza's schools.
According to the popular criteria, real estate prices showed the largest winter increase in seven years.
The RP Data Core Legal Housing Index for Housing Prices in the Australian Capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reported RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined 4.2 per cent increase in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the 12-month increase by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
Research director RP Data Tim Loules reported that Sydney and Melbourne were running a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney housing prices increased by 16.1 per cent over the past year, while in Melbourne they increased by 11.7 per cent.
The next market capacity was Adelaide, Brisbein and Darwin, where prices averaged between 5 and 6 per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government cost reductions were made, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Loulis said that now that spring began, there would be an increase in the number of real estates put on sale in the next few months, which would be a "true test" for the market.
"Taking into account the current high speed of auction sales, the overall high sales speed and the current conditions with a low interest rate are likely to increase the cost of housing in the next three months," he said.
How Do People Live in the Oldest House of Ufa?
In the former home of gold manufacturers and miners, Evdoquim and his son Ivan Demid on the streets of the October Revolution 57/1 (former Grand Kazanese) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has not changed much since construction, except in the case of the city’s edifice.
Foreigners walk here as a tour, and the residents are more affected than they are by their privilege of living in the oldest of the Ufim home, whose walls are remembered by General Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is not accurate, and historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out it's a building that's 300 years old.
Old yard, always open door, squeaking stairs.
The doors in the apartment are close to each other, the walls crack, and there's a street in the passage of the plastered plaster.
I think everything holds true.
And the local people say, "You don't think that's true."
Living in a wooden house in the 18th century is very difficult, ” says Tatyana Lukiyano, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The facility is in the public domain, but it has not been funded for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities have simply forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still thinly held up, but the foundation's gone.
Many residents still go to the bathroom outside and pray once a week in a public bath.
How can we be content under such circumstances?
The road passes right under the windows, not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatyana pushes the curtain away.
Now you can see that before, you've only heard that there's a flow of cars underneath the windows.
You see, the glass is constantly combing, we can't open the windows, we're used to noise.
But man is accustomed to everything, to what is good and what is bad.
Our apartment is still model, thank you husband, his hands are gold.
In particular, we have two rooms, living three with our son.
And other families have conditions that are much worse, and on the second floor, the ceilings are just over a foot and a half high.
In contrast, Tatyana offers to visit a neighbor from Ljudmila Starstarna's apartment No. 6.
A friendly hospitable woman offers a cup of coffee from the doorstep and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we still live with our husband and daughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another room, because Sophia's eyes are on a room: anthresols, two couches of "g," and one of them is a grandson with a laptop.
Very closely and very little is different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historic."
But the ceiling is regularly flowing, and the plumbing system is useless.
Sophia speaks of her apartment as an ordinary and amazing thing at the same time as an Italian woman whose home is on Roman ruins.
I mean, it's one very old and recent, day-to-day and legendal:
The plumbing took place some 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the backyard and a toilet in the ex-heart.
We live right where Demids and his family lived, and on the second floor, servants lived.
Our apartment isn't privatized, why?
The Ufa Real Estate Centre says privatization doesn't matter.
We'll only get a one-room apartment anyway, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised to settle down, but the promise did not go any further.
I'm not used to complaining, and I'm not.
My grandparents, my mother, my dad, my husband and my daughter, and my grandson lived in this apartment (room!).
Everything's been through this time.
Healthy rats, for example, ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flicker, they're three feet thick!
They say the solution was interwoven on the eggs, so it's been held up for so long.
The house's built solid, thanks to Demidov!
That's probably why no one was killed by a falling ceiling or by his own.
Only the building is slowly dying in front of us — the boards and the log houses rot, the floors are repeatedly falling apart, we are filling with cement, but it's useless -- the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say it's under our room of the secret loop and the way to the White River, which specifically made old people living here once so that they could hide from danger, in which case.
They were persecuted.
Sophia Starstyna tells of some historian coming to them, begging them to let him start a excavation in his apartment.
And then he convinced them to give their property in exchange for his one-on-one apartment on the Avenue of October.
Sophia's story says:
Where do we go four times alone?
And there's a little hope here that they'll give you more space.
We agreed to the exchange, nothing would have won.
The old man's family didn't win anything.
Ludmila's biggest dream was to be settled, and her 16-year-old daughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families were given a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations now live.
A pretty, miniature girl from apartments Nos. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two close rooms, a total of 23 m2, called apartments, live her large family.
We're just seven people, two kids.
You can see what the conditions are.
It is broken off by pieces, like window frames, in the kitchen walls and in the rooms through the holes.
The water in the tap is only cold for a year.
As you walk through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can see that the greatest luck you've ever seen is Lavrentyev's wife from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the outermost rooms in the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
A 75-square room, three people written.
We live in the very rooms where, by legend, Suvorov stayed while he was in Ufa,” says Alexander Dmitrijevich Lavrentyev, head of the family.
The ceilings are tall, wide.
It's one bad thing - everybody's cracking around the seams, falling apart, falling apart.
Neighbors must have already told me!
The most painful thing about us and our floors is that the wooden boards rotted, the ground literally went under our feet.
I've put the stakes, the blades; nothing else in the room, and in the other room, we're walking like we're rolling around on the swings, so fast.
The house of the merchant Eudoquim Demidov Alexander Dmitriewicz can tell you better than any tour guide.
The gold industry is treated as a native, and it is admired.
Indeed, the owner of Kagin and Uziang factories built houses, poured out guns and bells, and held Arab mines.
The heirs of purchase property are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child in the '40s, in the 20th century, ” says Alexander Dimitrijevic.
At that time, there were wooden carriage rooms, stables and caraul booths, which were subsequently destroyed.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but something was wrong...
The story was repeated in 2014: new housing was again lured.
As a team, we collected all the documents, escaped the necessary authorities, and suddenly learned that the move was to 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in...
Two years ago Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashcortostan to learn about the fate of the home.
Resident officials didn't accept.
They sent from one table to another, and then, in ridicule, they issued a paper without a signature and a press saying, "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the resettlement of residents."
I even felt like our house was gone for a long time, because first it was 57, then it became 57 A, and now it's 57/1.
It's like it was destroyed in the 1970s.
The “Russia Planet” has approached the Chief Information and Analysis Branch of the Land Administration of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
A house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the residential settlement programme.
I can't take responsibility for the actions of officials of the 1970s, but I know that there was a plan to demolish all the old houses at the time, despite the historic significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of modern authorities to rebuild all old houses in the streets of the October Revolution, which are of architectural value, has been successfully implemented.
Residents are soon planned to settle in new apartments.
According to Barabas, the House of Demidova will be renovated by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
An architectural binnal is currently under way in Italy, and the “Old Ufa” project is presented there, among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire old Kazan Street will be restored, says the official.
Homes will have a proper look, similar to what they were three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to become a museum open to all.
It has also been decided at the governmental level to make the street a pedestrian weekend.
It's not going to work, unfortunately, because there's too much traffic in the city.
Russell from the future Museum of Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be content with their new apartments being the same as the current ones.
Only from another age.
In Primorie, the storm started a forest fire
The dry storm caused a forest fire in the areas of the Hunting Forest in the Pozar district of the Primorsky.
At the site of the fire, a group of forces and assets is being strengthened.
According to the management of the CGHS, the Primor Air Base requires the involvement of aviation forces on the ground.
Vasili Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Airbase:
The fire, which occurred in a difficult area, was detected by an observer pilot on board an AN-2 patrol aircraft in an area of 3 hectares.
The wood residues on the old burner are burning.
The Territory ' s heavy cloud and a steep slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of landing-level fire-fighting sites pose significant challenges for the loss of life.
We need an MI-8 helicopter.
The movement of forces by an MI-2 helicopter and an AN-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, 4 parachutists were promptly removed.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the ground for the delivery of additional fire-fighting equipment.
In the area of lunch, 3 fire fighters were brought by helicopter to the village of Hunting.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, the specialists will be moved to the area of extinguishment, reported on the Primorsky Province Administration website.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, "Rudi's Raudi's Raids," which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mixture of horn and rap, and the tunes are lifesome.
Henry, however, had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother died, there was a "many" treatment, and Henry often reflected on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice say, "Stop making noises.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seimur and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a kid, would go to pub with him and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket punch.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was such a funny guy in the corner reading the newspaper most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a writing workshop in Dadley, and although conditions were better than in his father’s day, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
It's a little bit better now, but it's dark, smokey, deep mazes with lights and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father got into the bathroom and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to get rid of the casting shop.
When I got there, I realized that he had done this for years and years to make a living for us, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry came out of childhood with no parental affection.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got sick at the end of her life did we start saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don France, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don Frank.
Why don't I make friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with France where he's been married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I make friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical action.
Then I started a serious phytence class, and I also had to sit down on a strict diet to get rid of my symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's career path shift is perhaps reflected in his noble, short beard.
Ever since he got a confession of criticism for his Otello, he's been totally trapped in the theater.
I followed "The Comedy of Errors" and then "The fences" by August Wilson.
This work is different from the satcoms and comedy, which were an integral part of his rich professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
Dijey noticed how he rocks on stage and wrote about him in "New Faces."
His career on television began in the mid-1970s: "For quite a long time, I was the only black parodyman/comb on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I had to learn to be an effective machine for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, as a star working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in New Persons in 1975
Since his manager had the right to "Black and White minstrels Show," a light entertainment program in which people "sniffed their face," Henry found himself performing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I think I want it never to happen to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked in large areas and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the prized easy entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "the black people's grotesque parody."
Imagineing and singing about the black culture in the United Kingdom, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project on the eightieth.
The first season of the "Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and it was known as Gareth Blacklock, chief chef at the "Shef" comedy.
Advertising videos, documentary films, TV series and the role of the movie took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008, Lenny Henry.tv thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're pulling your time or quietly turning away."
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's the Good In..."
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I had real allergies on Shakespeare.
I can't say that I'm being taught this completely in school, and I thought it was, to a large extent, the prerogative of middle class white people with bells and hoods down in front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't worry about it until you know what you're talking about.
Do some of these things out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Otello's last monologism for documentary transmission, and it got caught.
I felt like I could do it.
It's like my head was corrected.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, taking it seriously, learning your text, doing a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we put it.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
We soon started the Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his business was to entertain the public.
"The quiet voice inside me said, "You're gonna have to work for 10 minutes while they're doing the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else deal with this.
"You play a play, stay in the play."
Henry's in the "Abortions" at the Duches Theatre.
It was difficult to learn the text for the fences.
Panic is useful enough to strengthen the musculature.
She was also accepted well, so it was like a sign above showing you "what you should do."
He says it, of course, with a thunderous voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry's still thinking about a comedian -- all the way around, our conversation is interrupted by the bursts of his humor when he starts, and he's done with parody.
I just decided not to work in the booth, because this thing with instant remuneration from a complete stranger's room, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're looking forward to it all the time, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work on the Apollo Airline when I want to, but mostly I don't get as much pleasure as I used to.
I'm asking if he's ever gonna give the booth a tour.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle, and the end of the journey -- I don't think I'll ever want to give up that.
So it's a new version of it?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice fun.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya started biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid shall be reported in a government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Keniata promised to reduce corruption in public structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit found earlier this year that at least $1 million (70000) per month was lost by payments to “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to be paid in bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC Vanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants must appear in the next two weeks at identification centres to guarantee that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, as reported in a government statement.
Anyone who fails to do so without a valid reason will be removed from the balance of payments.
“This procedure will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants and will also be used to clear the statement of payments at both levels of government, thus putting an end to the problem of `invisible workers'”, said Ann Wajguru, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Structure of Power.
Ten Turkish police officers arrested in connection with a “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the Government”, reports local news agencies.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Herrriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in anti-corruption activities last December, which were aimed at checking government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and listening to the phone.
Turkish President Reggie Tayip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic clique Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) following the summer vacation.
This day has traditionally been a great occasion for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsini Yatsinuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told expected journalists that not all schools had opened again, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony was not held in every school on September 1.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful heavens.
The whole of Ukraine, an enormously unified Ukrainian people's front, must fight for the peaceful heavens.
Alexan Pastukhov, the headmaster of the Slavyansk school, where Jaczouk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study has traditionally been observed by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
Rona Fairhead BBC may have found the kind of inspiring manager she needs.
It is followed by a record of fame from the banking world, the media administration and the interior of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience in decision-making positions.
Her career began with Bain and Co, a consulting firm on global governance, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world media in Pearsons.
She was the manager of the Financial Times for seven years when she resigned when Pearson's head office was occupied by a male colleague who held a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are approaching 1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
It was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring professionals from the private sector to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former adviser to Tori.
Earlier in May, I named the Chairman of the poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the very heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two objectives: inside as the top management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable Duopoly, which requires complete radical reform.
However, what new chairman would risk coming to untie and destroy the institution as hard as the Chinese dynasty if he himself lost his job in the process.
It's a tough decision.
It wouldn't be that hard, many people would be happy to see BBC reduce its size - after a review of its powers, finance and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge comfortable old habits, inevitable negotiations on the cost of a licence pose a particular danger to BBC.
For a modest amount of .145.50 per year, the British acquire a share of the world’s largest media plant, of course.
BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of households and stand only 40p per day.
Moreover, it is clear that Beeb's popularity is growing, with 53 per cent now supporting it, compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The models for watching and using BBC have changed: now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch the missed software on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope it found him.
Perry from Texas says that the humiliating Twitter was written by someone else.
A Twitter from the confirmed account of the Governor of Texas, the Republican Rick Perry, on Sunday evening contained an offensive portrayal of the district attorney from the democracies, who is at the centre of criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
Twitter was later removed and followed by another account from Perry, in which the record was disproved.
A tweet was just posted from my account, which was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I removed it," says a later recording.
Perry’s assistants did not immediately respond to the communications requesting comment.
Although the records were downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was actually publishing on that tape.
Earlier Twitter contained a sloppy cartoon for the District Attorney, Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who found guilty of drinking in April 2013.
Perry banned the funding of her office when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a large jury in Ossetia this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate for the 2016 elections.
The text reads: “I do not always drive a car in a state of intoxication three times the allowable level of alcohol in the blood... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry with it for telling me.”
I'm the most drunk democracy in Texas.
The Lembergh department did not investigate the large jury against Perry.
They were occupied by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed as a Republican judge.
Perry did not confess guilt and called the charges a political trick.
His powerful legal team had asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law that was used to prosecute the governor, who had been acting longer than anyone in the history of Texas, would be vague, contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding by $7.5 million from the State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in the public sector of Texas when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto has raised a formal complaint from a public monitoring group with left-wing views.
Perry's confirmed account is often updated and is sometimes famous.
When Perry came to the fifth party convention in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, he responded to rumours that he could leave the game by tweeting a photograph of himself running next to the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Burkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to a "normal state"
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England had “returned” to normal activity.
Homes in the capital were subject to lively demand and rising prices, and there was widespread fear that a credit bubble would lead Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's elite construction company, said on Monday: “From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to the normal level of transactions since the peak of 2013,” adding that this provided a `stabilistic working environment'.
The London real estate market was successful during the recession, as foreign buyers moved into the capital.
The city ' s prices have risen by 18.5 per cent over the past year alone, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly oversaw the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
By the end of April, the average market prices for private, affordable and student schemes had increased by about one fifth.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential “temple tax” before the general elections in the next May.
The London Real Estate Agency, Foxtons, warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced tighter loan terms, would also lead to a decline in market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, involving further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its projection of rising prices for London's real estate for 2015 to 3 per cent, on the basis that the trend in real estate prices has already begun to decline.
In the meantime, transactions fell by a quarter of the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, according to WA Allis.
Nevertheless, the demand for houses in the capital proved to be very beneficial for Berkeley, raising sales above ?2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijley added, "The demand for the right product with good design and the best location remained unchanged and reflected this, the sale continued for a while."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year by the end of April, almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
The annual revenue before paying taxes rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to .380 million, and income by 18 per cent to .1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pijley reported that the expected revenue of Berkeley for that year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, profits are expected for the entire year prior to the payment of taxes in the US$ 450 million.
The value of the Berkeley shares was maintained at .23.96 in the afternoon on the London exchange.
Pictures of naked Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
The images of a naked actress, Jennifer Lawrence, who was awarded the Oscar prize, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who says he has a catalogue of pictures of another 100 rising stars.
The representative of the Star of the Famine Games confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence were real and condemned the hacker for "immediate invasion of personal space".
Law enforcement agencies have been contacted, and they will pursue anyone who will publish stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photographs originally posted on the 4han exchange site were allegedly the result of a lack of the Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged haemorrhage catalogue of hacked victims includes the names of dozens of female celebrants, including Rianna, Kim Cardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzFed.
It is not clear how many of these photographs are true, although the Star of Scott Pilgrim Against All, Winsted on Twitter, was also condemned by hacking.
"The one who looks at the pictures we took with my husband a few years ago when we were alone in the house -- I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winston on Twitter.
But Victoria Justice, of Nickolodeon's series "iCarly" and "Victoire Win", denied that she had written in Twitter, "These are so-called pictures of I'm naked by FALSWICK, a people.
Let me stop it in the embryo.
Buzfeed reported last Sunday that Ariana Grande's pop star representative denied that the pictures she was supposed to take were genuine.
Exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new love novel and the letter "J" that praised critics
They were dissolved, and the best way to say it is, they were gradually falling apart like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only at times did the woman tell him that he was too serious, too heavy to communicate, tense, closed, and perhaps somewhat irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw himself as irritable.
He was as thorny as a meal, yes.
The last victim of this thorny thing was a little novel from which he expected more than usual to be freed from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a gracefully fragile beauty with broken hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village even more remote and harsh than Port Royben.
She came south with a companion older than herself, whom she considered to be aunts, and the latter inherited a house in the raw but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "Rain Valley".
No one lived in the house for several years.
The tubes were running, the spiders were sitting upright in the baths, and the mucus left their tracks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; and the garden was filled with weeds that looked like giant caps.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, simultaneously frightening and charming, with a complete secret garden.
The author's view is Howard Jacobson, whose "J" novel is included in the Buckerow Prize Long List in 2014.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Quever and Aileen were sitting by their hands in broken loungers among the tall grass, enjoying the suddenly warm spring day; they were both scattered to a cheap console that provided the country with soothing music and soothing news when, looking at her crossed brown feet, he remembered the old song of a long-forgot black performer, whom his father loved to listen to, dropped curtains in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their inherent aggression, the songs of this type were no longer played on consoles.
They were not forbidden - nothing was prohibited - but they were no longer lost.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archatical."
Public taste has done something that could never have been achieved by orders and prescriptions, and just as books have chosen the memoirs of rich people who have grown up in poverty, cooking books, and love novels, music has been used for ballads.
On this day's trip, Kevin started playing the imaginary piano and the rough comic voice singing Eileen's big legs.
Aileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular Jazz Piano song, called Fats Waller," he told her, machineically putting two fingers on her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she goes off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father as he told him.
Start the word "J" by forgetting to attach two fingers to your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew he was expecting it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Aileen never heard of him.
Jazz didn't play, although he wasn't openly banned.
Improvisation's out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the tune began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with sharpness.
His unpredictability worked on people’s nerves.
Jazz was a piece of music.
Although he was 10 years old and had never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kever knew about the Jazz from the father's semisecret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Ailenn that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she could hardly remember the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no law or pressure.
The society was obedient, which meant that each of its segments agreed with the thanks - the gratitude of those who had been preserved by fate - to the principle of group bias.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin, by temperament and physical characteristics, were well suited for entertainment and sports, and they were singing and running.
Indostanes, as if by nature talented in everything they had to do with electronics, began to make sure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was done by sanitary work; what was left of the Greek was beaten by a plate.
The people of the Persian Gulf and Lévant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, when what happened was that the World had gone through, fearing that they were being accused of arson, fearing, just saying that the flames would consume them from the next ones, opened restaurants with labbies and hookers, and hung them out, and were trampling on by idleness.
Each one by his or her abilities.
Since she had heard only ballads before, Eileen found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that Kevin had just said to her could have been based on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kever.
Unless maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the garden that was set up gave him an illusion of security.
No word could pass through the sound insulating of giant leaves that looked like capstos.
Eileen still didn't understand.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to press two fingers with her again.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She's messed her head up, closing the view.
There was nothing in the whole world but a fossil of her black hair.
Nothing he wants to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying in her opinion.
But that doesn't explain why you're eating it.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I've got such a perversion.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often brought him into awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty covered in jesting.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to.
Despite good eyes.
Eileen Solomons was brightened and rose from the chaff, overthrew the console and spilled the wine they drank.
The wine from the buzine, so the intoxication could not justify him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
I don't like it, though.
He was sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She did not talk to him about living in the cold northern Archipelago, where she grew up, but he did not doubt that she was basically like the one here.
The same huge ice ocean hit both of them.
The same mischievous men, even more sensitive and capricious after what had happened, had fallen upon their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered furiously from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand against any woman who dared to refuse them or to provoke them.
Dumb head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
A kiss first - a kiss is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; an anti-aircraft against the fresh ballads that the console gave up - first kiss it and then hit it.
An unnecessary clarification, according to Coveran, because a kiss was by itself a hooliganism.
Aileen Solomons' body showed him he had to leave.
He got up from a chauffeur like an old man.
She felt the headache herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she watched him leave, and her companion was a man himself who was causing himself hardship.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and the men in general, although some of them raised their hands on her.
A man who turned away from her, with a bent back, shamed, battled, all the struggle left him -- why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember a single case until today when she saw it?
Once again, Aileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before or near the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in the Offnau, an informal public-mental control service, produced a small report on the persistence of low and medium-level violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decline if it did not stop entirely, given the resources and forces allocated to its eradication.
"Many things have been done, and many things have been done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggression of the people who fought in the thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow skaters of places where, despite the steaming churches over the towns, the tender breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
However, some of the qualities have proved to be inexorable.
The higher the pin, it seems, the lower the passions it creates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows up stories of the obstacles overcome and proclaims its dusting faith in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does old rudeness remain strong in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is also evidence that new and viciousness is being created in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate habit of writing too much," said her scientific leader, reading the report as a whole.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum put her head down.
I must also ask you, Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," replied Emme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," finally said Luther Rabinitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have any prejudices here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, totally acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort results, such as what you have shown me.
Obviously, you're prejudiced against the church yourself, and what you call "wicked" and "drum" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural life's love and energy.
To continue to be bored about the one thing which has happened is to deprive the country of its vital life.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinitz spoke.
Behind his head pink, like a flamengo, the LED letters echoed the advice Ofnau gave the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your wife, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, a word of song better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you mean to say," replied Esme Nussbaum quietly when she was convinced that her scientific leader had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been cured as effectively as we can convince ourselves.
I'm concerned that if we're not ready, we'll find that we're repeating the mistakes that originally led to what happened when the General Assembly did.
Only this time will we throw our anger and mistrust at others.
Luther Rabinitz connected his fingers in a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling "mistakes" the actions that our grandfathers did or did not do.
You go too far, and when you talk about putting their anger and mistrust on "others."
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that when we understand the past, that is, defending the present, we are not talking about "us" and "they".
There was no "us" and there were no "others."
It was a time of unrest, that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with herself," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can rightly justify itself.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done was done.
It was then.
We don't have to say anything else. We agree here.
And as no one should be blamed, no one should be acquitted if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why is the past, if not to learn?
The past thing to make us forget it.
If I can add one word to that--
Luther Rabinitz’s Piramidian collapsed.
"I'll consider your report," said he, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a rider who went to the sidewalk, described by passersby as "in a vicious rage."
There's coincidences.
Lesotho Army states that no coup was planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho Army representatives denied that a coup had been prepared to overthrow the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police, who had been suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country's army surrounded its official residence and captured government buildings in Maseru's capital.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with suicide.
The army spokesman, Major Ntlele Ntoi, stated that there was no coup, but that the army responded to the threat posed by the “political fanatics” whom the police tried to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces took steps to obtain a number of intelligence reports that there are some elements within the police force that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were prepared to cause chaos”, he told the Voice of America.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Monjela, stated that the army ' s actions looked like a coup.
“While no one had submitted any claim of taking power by force, it was reported that the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces currently had the main signs of a coup,” he said.
The Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers had returned to barracks on Sunday and that it was calm in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing runs the Government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabana suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his unified Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government despite allegations of the contrary.
The Chelsea protector, Marco van Ginkel, will spend the coming season on lease rights in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours to undergo a medical examination.
In the past season, he only went to a field in London’s club three times.
Remember what Milan used to rent from Liverpool's attacking Fernando Torres.
Production in the eurozone at the lowest rate in 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The last value of the Eurozone production index (PMI) for Markit fell to 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed and enterprises were affected by growing tensions between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The significance came to the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets will wait for the bank to have a clear plan to deal with the recovery of the eurozone, as well as the risk of deflation for inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
It is suggested that the head of the ECB, Mario Dragi, may give additional signals later this week, that he is considering a quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by Great Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than any growth, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more evident," said Rob Dobson, senior economist Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia ' s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest point 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of great concern, as is Italy ' s weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth momentum has been reduced mainly by the industrial engine, Germany, and Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowing down of the industry is likely to carry the oil into the fire for analysts awaiting additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI has grown to 57.3 at its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist of IHS Global Intelligence, said, "The best thing to say about the August study of the business index of the production sector of the eurozone is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: “The producers of the eurozone are obviously finding life very difficult at the present time, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially those related to Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainties to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has apparently hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "it's more like" that the ECB would eventually have to do some kind of quantitative mitigation, "though we suspect it's going to be limited."
The people of Mariupoli will show up a live chain against the militia.
In Mariupola until last week, everything was calm - no one was eager to organize the Mariopolian People's Republic, and the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
The residents now look forward with horror to the arrival of the "Occupiers".
Political scientists say that separatists are breaking into Mariopola to reach the Azov Sea - the city of Novoazowsk has recently been adopted and has not been part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariopolians decided that the Ukrainian army, although defending them, had a little force against the highly armed NAM-LDL members, and were about to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and strengthens.
On Saturday evening, several thousand people came to the eastern border of the city and entered a busy chain, crucifying Ukraine’s anthem.
They're going to do the same thing in case of an attack.
The volunteers collect and collect equipment and food, collect medicines, and publish the newspaper.
Stores are gradually closing in the city, banks and ATMs are being shut down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the terrible capture of school like the children who have been in it still suffer
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day test that shocked the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during the school violence
Just ten years after the terrible capture of the Beslan school, during which 334 people died, including 186 children who had been heroically survivors of the disaster, warned last night of a new Apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, seized and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be something of a kind of extreme possible evil.
The tragedy has brought the east and west together in a reversal, which in a remarkable way has then turned into action and hope for the future in the face of the greatest grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, in southern Russia, to find some of the victims who had deceived death during the violence in school.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted evil, even though the memories of a terrorist hell will live forever with them.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now putting up with Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now end.
The girl in the picture is trying to get back to the shooting gymnasium.
It was recorded in a picture of a famous Russian photographer, Dimitri Belayakov, who was trying to get back into a shooting gymnasium after a mine explosion.
I was desperate for my mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them had died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run, but I couldn't," Aida said then.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she was totally restored, but yesterday she said, "The pain came back three months ago.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few fragments remain in my lap.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the same way that doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but of course it didn't break it," she said with a call.
"It happened to me, and it cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to this gymnasium to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it any other day.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Deer Gapoev was murdered there.
We played together when we were little, and we wanted to go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about my family later.
She says that her capture remains with her, although memories are a little dull every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people from Britain and from all over the world.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I'm in the school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through hail of bullets, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (Russians begin school at the age of 7), and survived three days of seizure, hugging their mother Tamaru.
Then he was seven, and he said, "My mother told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Flee."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran off, saw the crying baby on the road, grabbed the baby by the hand, and ran through hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who took his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I was unable to save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in a hospital with leg injuries, thinking that her son had died.
After their reunification, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran away and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent newspaper, News of the World), where he was awarded as Protector of Children from the Barrardo's Foundation by Prime Tony Blair and his wife, Sheri.
"This is a nightmare coming back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you that he's going through my memory.
I remember when I threw away all my toy weapons right after that.
But now I can play video game shooting, and it's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that sports hall, but I don't think of myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard I never got out.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to pick whatever I wanted, and I was allowed to travel in an open-top car.
But now he fears for places such as Ukraine, where wars cause the grief that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damier, who was doing volunteer work at the women's monastery last week.
I want to help.
I want to serve as a police officer, and I hope I'm admitted to the Academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, aged 48, said, "37 children were killed in our block, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence right after the capture, there were no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She remembers her trip to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I realized that people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings and can provide support.
She was grateful to Sheri Blair and her fund for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her myself that 10 years went by, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when D'Amir wanted to eat a boar, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waitresses at a restaurant, Damier shot them with his water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and to support us.
She said, "I don't think this world has been any better in 10 years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for many people war is a news report they're listening to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very mild and calm boy, and he was neither aggressive nor angry.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not stuck in this last nightmare.
I know he doesn't like remembering him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym every now and then and then they light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it -- I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
I didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and all his other military toys.
I find it hard to believe that for hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and stand on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell all around me as parts of the body lay everywhere.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run, run," but again, I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran.
In this way life continues for us, unlike so many others.
George Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking picture after the capture became a determining factor in the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: Survivor Beslan George Ilyin and his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004 and George's case today
His bloodthirsty face was marked by fear as he was rescued from death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, aged 54, was taken to school by the chief doctor on the first day of her education before taking his oldest son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days in a nightmare," she remembered.
Not exactly alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George survived.
The closer the date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's not a single day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I don't think it happened yesterday, some of the scenes of these days are in front of me all the time.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
In the shower, Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember George was so eager to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of George's crying in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookstore at our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this picture, people around the world are feeling our pain.
George now says, "It's important that this never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never learn the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was called?
This world is leading to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants a war because it's happening?
Ten years is nothing to hurt.
We need decades to go by to forget her.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares of capture, but now it's better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going into this gymnasium before every 1 September.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gymnasium, but I have to do it.
I don't feel a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life is going on.
I graduated from school this year and went to the medical university in Vladikakakaz.
I'll study to become a cardiosurgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health wouldn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
George Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
Unbelievable: George Farniev was at the feet of a killer terrorist during the seizure, but he survived.
During the seizure, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer terrorist.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says George, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but was unable to do so because of the damage to his health during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children can easily cope with bad events -- I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little bit better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the first and last time I entered this gymnasium was next year.
I'm unconscious.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photograph.
Survivor: George Farniev today with a laptop photo of himself in the hospital after the capture
My pain is great, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as physical condition is concerned, I'm well.
I need to be careful with my knee, which has been damaged, but I'm walking normally now.
But health didn't let me go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that this was not possible.
The second thing I enjoyed was animals, so I went to the veterinary school.
I've studied there for two years.
He's learning how to treat all the cats and cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
It's not what children should know, and of course it's not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, age 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know Georgie's not going.
She's supposed to be stronger for him because he was there and I'm not.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He had several operations, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I would say he's 50 percent out of this nightmare, but it's impossible to completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the seizure, and it only increases my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what's happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe it.
We were the only friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them away, as far as you can.
Alona Tskaeva, 10 years old
A young man who was emotionally taken to a safe place by a Special Forces fighter
Saved: Alenu Tskaev is taken to a safe place by the Russian Special Forces (left).
She's ten (right) now, and she doesn't remember a terrible crime.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alena took a Russian policeman from a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, her ten-year-old sister, Christine, and Brother Mahar in the school gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alenina’s mother and sister died in a deadly slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has since remarried, and they and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little daughter whom he called Christine in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alona, now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and blossoms into a smart and happy girl, and neighbors say.
"They are a great happy family now, and Alona and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
The Singji Kagawa, a defender who returned from Manchester United to the Dortmund "Bossia", noted that he looked forward to returning to the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this is a happy career event.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm going to play "Bossia" again, and Bild says Cagawa.
I feel very good.
A field of positive emotion and looking forward to entering the field again in the form of "Bossia."
Remember, Kagawa went to the MoU in the summer of 2012 for Euro16 million.
However, he was never able to be a member of the English club, holding only 38 matches in two seasons at the English championship, scored six balls and gave eight results.
A man is accused of riding a girl at a Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fifa.
A 78-year-old man will be brought before a court on charges of a three-year-old girl at the Pelican Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fifa.
Gordon Stuart allegedly shot a girl down at the Pittenwin crossing in East Nowk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart had led his Audi Q3 without due diligence and attention and had hit the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78 years old, from Anstruter, denied his guilt in Dundee's sheriff's court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the royal lawyer, fixed the date of the trial for January.
Obama, Merkel and Holland won't end up in Vladivostok
Vladivostok's duty-free shop removed a plate prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders in the shop.
Don't turn them into perfumes, vodka and horse.
The shop administration decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, Chancellor of FRG Angel Merkel, President François Alland of France, Vitaly Klicko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other prominent comrades would not be able to extract vodka, horse and perfume from their store.
And I put a tablet on the door.
In the past, Obama had been banned from even less accessible by the service of a facility known as the Dietary Table Centre, as reported on by the site of the general welfare facility.
Whether the U.S. president ever wanted to eat in a diet dining room in Russia is not known, but the authors of the prohibitions clearly seem to be extremely clever.
After the embargo, did Medvedev give advice to the agricultural community?
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dimitri Medvedev, believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should develop new technologies in order to ensure the production of the varieties of cheese required by buyers.
The board was given during the visit of Agrocomplex to the South Pacificprom company.
The Head of Government also advised the Rectors to adjust to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the appropriate level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since 7 August.
The main trainer of the Russian Federation, Valentine Maslak, is pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, third place is a good result given the lack of targeted preparations for competitions.
Our athletes spoke at their level, with Maslakoff's words "This Sport."
The third is the confirmation of our high enough command level.
It is a pleasure that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It should be borne in mind that we were not preparing for these competitions.
The season is over, and we did not commit our leaders to participating in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we've been second to this tournament, but during this season, we've been up-to-date.
On the contrary, the French set up a fighting team of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which has been publicly announced on many occasions.
Even so, the contest owners were unable to resist the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have taken part in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were less order than the same Brigadier League.
Season's over.
Of course, athletes are no longer so important in command-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And as a result, we agree, it was absurd for men to get so involved with the tactical maneuvers of the race at 1,500 metres, that they showed the results below the average... of women's races.
4 Hints on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a picture or take a video under the water, there are a number of options.
The cheapest option is a watertight mill, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures on a family holiday with a couple of cameras, all at a cost of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, several rules have to be observed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure the camera battery and other compartments are locked tight.
Besides, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you're going to take.
Some cameras and cameras have surveying regimes or object type that optimize the exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, see how deep your equipment can go.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our customer leadership and digital camera ratings for both traditional and watertight models.
Take off a few people because many of them won't.
There's a JCD that's going to help you make pictures, whereas there's usually no action cameras.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be hard to see under the water, and the frame layout will be a random process.
So do a few things.
Also, if your camera has a serial recording mode that takes off a few people with a little different exposures, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The amount of light is significantly decreasing than you are diving into the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you take off in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to pass more colors on photographs; the deeper you go, the smaller you will see.
Come closer to the sites.
It's a great advice for land surveying, but it's even more important under water because of dark light conditions.
Especially important if you are filming an action camera: this equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you have to get closer to the sites if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Bronze Spearhead of the Olympic Games on the Free Fight of Bilal Mahov can be transformed into a Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by Sajid Saidov, chief trainer of the complete Dagestan struggle.
The expert did not rule out the participation of the athlete at the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
At present, Bilal Mahov is at the meeting of the classics team, with the words “R-Sport” of Sajid Saidov.
In fact, Bill's underages were both.
At the world ' s first youth in 2005, he won the Voltaires tournament and the third prizer in Greek Roman competitions and decided to focus on the free struggle.
It's been a long time since we've been talking about a new phase of our career that our weight will be in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll tell you more: Machov can play at the world championship in Tashkent if he wins.
But the crucial word is always behind the coach headquarters headed by Goga Koguashville.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality strength could shake around him, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
An anesthesiologist, an anesthetist, devoted his career to freeing the sick from both suffering and suffering.
Among those who approached him was his wife, an MI-6 officer, who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson realized that while the doctor was obsessed with diagnosis and disease, those who were undergoing treatment were mostly concerned about something else -- pain.
Once in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
I found it hard to find strength in myself.
When he was struggling with flulike symptoms, he found that he resented his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he remarked.
When Juliet left for the week, Lawson found out he was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to X-ray the chest.
Just two weeks earlier, he had skied in the French Alps.
The X-ray results are here.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer users have been able to smoke.
But it's different with mesothelioma.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called "miracle," but which is now known to be deadlyly dangerous.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that we can ignore.
Asbestos is, after all, material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a recommendation industrial ban entered into force.
Even when used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: those who worked in the pipelines, construction workers, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another age is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But this calmness is wrong.
Britain appears to be at the height of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
There's more people dying from mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die from the disease as from road accidents.
Annual deaths from mesothelomy since 1980 and projected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly effects now is that, while the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually prohibited by law in 1999), mesotheliomas usually go on for decades.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans in industrial construction.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, placed in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not focus on the class, level of wealth, profession or age.
The elective bastions, from the fashionable London department store to private schools, turned out not to be saved.
The Parliament building is inundated with asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have proved to be the reservoirs of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't an insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he might be in contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It is said that there might have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guya Hospital, where I spent six years in internship," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and trucks - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
That was a question that, unfortunately, he could provide a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who have been trained in Guya Hospital and who have subsequently developed a mesothelomy over the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I was the only survivor."
How many of us are going to get sick with this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with "mesothelooma" when he was 48 years old.
When he died, on 17 February this year, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of Mesothelioma patients die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are going to get the same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pito, a leading expert on mesothelioma in Britain, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't know what they're going to die like this anymore.

The rapid review of the reports from the courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how widespread the attack by mesotheliomas has been.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen had been unsupervised in contact with asbestos.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running two clothing units, one of which was the chief store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before it happened," she said, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't have thought I'd be affected.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance but a group of six minerals.
They are named after the word “asbestictiform”, which means a fiber structure that communicates strength and flexibility to them.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is found much more frequently in buildings today.
It was used in bloody panels, indoor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boilers, even brake wells of cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is nevertheless recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage”, which can lead to death.
However, brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (croquidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there are substantial, though indirect, grounds for believing that this is the main cause of the extremely high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom]”.
Marks & Spence was exposed to asbestos at the company’s main store in Oxford Street, London.
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “a substantial percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known impact on work or at home, was probably caused by asbestos from the environment”.
Most of these impacts, he says, are due to the “normal use and impact of the weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Conventioning report, which addressed the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the very center of government, might have been exposed unknowingly.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees had been contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be turned into something as harmless as “strong air flows”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but the opposite seems true.
Although the Parliament Technical Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “clean sanitary certificate”, it now recognized that work was needed on  & 1 billion to rebuild the Parliament by improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that, after the general elections of 2015, members of Parliament might meet in the QE2 conference centre near the Westminster, rather than on the green benches of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that “the asbestos situation was not governed by various rules”.
It is not possible to know whether this management error will cost your life.
All you can do now is wait.
One who has never been able to detect his contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practice doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, aged 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he was working in hospitals.
"I've been working in a hospital that's been successfully sued for asbestos," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day early in December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late at night.
Suddenly, I started to get angry.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from a pleura, a covering around the lungs.
But like Janice Ellen, he just had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
After all, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took X-rays of the chest and placed pleurial catheters to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.
Yet, his condition was not diagnosed.
His health has gradually improved, and he has returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was in sports and breathing heavily.
In 2011, a patient named Abbott came to his home with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with “mesothelooma”.
However, even then, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was ten years older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated again, and his consultant showed his CT results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped sensor was introduced into a strip between his thorax and the lining of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
I didn't worry too much about it, frankly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year's: "I was told it was mesothelooma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott got caught up in a meeting with McMillan's nurses, one of whom asked him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
"It turns out asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where quite often asbestos thermal insulation was on pipes," he said.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now strikes younger people with unusual occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in the hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients will be affected.
But many of the staff who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
For several decades after the war, hospitals appeared to be a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for the patients, but a place that threatened the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
School students set their Bunzen burners on asbestos bearings
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbesthet was often used in offices, shops, libraries and mayors because of its remarkable isolation and fire resistance.
Schools, too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in a class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, school children placed their Bunzen burners on asbestos trays.
Websites have been launched to highlight the problem of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, harmless things, such as the plastic stove or the roofs of the sheds, were usually used to contain asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that's embedded in a lot of our constructions," says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guya Hospital.
In one case, the only contact the sick woman could recall was the demolition of the garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful to sleep in garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis when it's known that the disease is incurable, ogroman.
"It takes quite a while to realize it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to go and sort myself out.
Well, I'm not meeting Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor to a patient.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information he needed to receive.
"It was hard to understand," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I've been given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not gonna meet Christmas again.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it's the mechanics of how we sustain life -- the act of breathing itself -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can be stuck in a plough, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers are irritable and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is caused by the inhalation of the needle fibers of asbestos," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guya Hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading mesothelioma treatment centre.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some of the others who were probably exposed while in hospital.
When the needles of asbestos fall into the lungs, says Treger, "they are pushed into the field where the lining is located by breathing.
This is essentially an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatments for other forms of cancer are far less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is a source of heated controversy.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treger doesn't agree.
"You can't cut a pleura," he says.
You can't go around her with a knife.
In the meantime, this cancer is "not very good at chemotherapy," which is "acting," but it doesn't cure.
"There are some long-lived patients at times," says Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.
Two-and-a-half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became the sole support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Allo, Cancer Central," he said happily when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
He first offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "suffered to give only a little more positive color."
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Laszunski, a professor of thoracic surgery at the Guya Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," Graham admitted.
The average patient would have had to receive guidance and approval for funding.
Money is crucial for those with mesothelioma to obtain the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment is finally not effective, many patients are faced with another financial concern — the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fish Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," said Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small quantities could put health at risk.
It was then that they talked about the integrity of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guya Hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a full-cost settlement, according to Morgan, because Lawson was unable to prove clearly that his mesothelomy was the result of contact with asbestos in Guya Hospital.
After an investigation into his death, the representative of the Ghaia hospital nevertheless confirmed that “asbestos in the basements referred to had been removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, tying death to asbestos to one company or place of work — usually decades later — has proved to be a major problem for patients with mesothelioma that require compensation.
Many of their former employers changed ownership or closed.
Insurance records could be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that there's no time on their side.
In response this year, serious new legislation has been issued to facilitate the recovery of compensation for patients with mesothelioma, even if their former employers cannot be tracked.
The Act established a 350-million-million-dollar insurance-funded fund for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who are not to be tried.
In such cases, the patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case, about 120,000.
About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that ?350 million are “very good jobs” for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, implying that the sum is a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if they hadn't intervenedd temporarily and those with mesothelioma could track down companies and file a claim in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “unfulfilled”.
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that seven people die every day, rapid action was necessary.
"People are suffering so much, and they need help today," Penning said during Bill's second reading of the Mesothelioma last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loik Lange-Laszunski for 19 months.
After primary consultations, Lange-Laszunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lanj Lazdunski can boast 40 per cent of patients who have survived in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
"This, of course, is one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some power that's backing you up.
When you give up, things can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott was in surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The subsequent scans did not show any trace of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few stains in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a life threat.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, the process is both physical and emotional.
You can think of practical things like finance when I die, for example, or what I need to show my wife how the timer works on a boiler.
When you get the bad news, you get sad.
We need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16, and Tamzin, aged 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to old age.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin's very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many of us received a phone call very quickly.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for those with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by a perplexing possibility of survival.
The disease carries with it (even as Stephen Jay Gould eventually does) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma does not constitute a threat to life.
The bodies of the embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos tissues.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen the pot and to increase heat resistance.
The hefty Elder describes asbestos.
Now it's invented a canvas that doesn't light up.
I saw his napkin napkins smoldering in the stones at the banquets.
The modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to produce paper (even bank notes) and tissues.
Major asbestos mines are being opened in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in the Americas, Italy and Russia.
It's the perfect thermal insulation for steam engines and the Industrial Revolution turbine.
The global production of asbestos is increasing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Prudential statistics identify premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and who are therefore denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook shows that the asbestos particles in her lungs "were undoubtedly the main cause of death."
This is the first case of this type.
The employers of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not recognize responsibility.
No compensation is paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding, one of the most deadly professions in terms of contact with asbestos, is developing intensively.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage caused by contact with asbestos in the United Kingdom.
The world ' s asbestos production has grown to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
Great Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in Great Britain requires that all asbestos contractors be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in Britain.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesotheli Act was adopted in Great Britain.
The compensation scheme was announced in the amount of .350 million.
Asbestos is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is at approximately 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose its leaders; protestors swear revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
This is likely to trigger long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the All-China People ' s Congress essentially allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't deceive our expectations, but it does make us angry," said legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They deceived Hong Kong people.
And obviously we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
The defense of China's decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing the popular election of Hong Kong's leader would be too “haothical”.
Since 1997, when Great Britain transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to vote as head of Government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives Hong Kongs the right to direct vote; however, it also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a commission to nominate candidates strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was made after summer when one of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong over the years.
Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which the organizers threatened to close the financial district of Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee genuine universal voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong Government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was moving to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise in protest in the weeks ahead.
However, they did not provide details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement had “considered the possibility of taking over the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that could only be taken if all possibilities of dialogue had been exhausted and no other choice had been made.
It is with great regret that we report that, to date, all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the central area will no doubt be occupied.
The public authorities in Hong Kong were preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and on Sunday at Government headquarters, security measures were strengthened through the use of police and barricads.
Many people in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
Population flows from the mainland increase competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong ' s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations are at risk of business, a source of life in Hong Kong.
"The test they're talking about, it can cause significant economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long," said the legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
It's an image that's harmful to investment.
The Chinese State media have also reported in recent days on which Hong Kong democratic activists have been shown to be combatants sent by the Western Powers.
During the summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands came to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American prom culture reaches university life: first-year students were offered to come on a personal plane
We're happy to respond to this demand by launching Britain's first "lux" travel service for current students.
In order to give a clear impression of coming to university, the company also offers transport options such as a personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Pantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also said the service was thinking about security.
This service is the ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their things across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping students this year get to university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
The representative of the company reported that since the service had just been launched, no orders had yet been received, but added that “students would order the service in the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that despite the fact that students had to pay $9,000 a year, it hoped to find a market for that service.
The current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students criticized this service as isolated from reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NPO for Higher Education, said, "This project seems incredibly isolated from the lives of most students.
Many university students this month face a cost-of-living crisis where affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants does not meet the rising cost of basic needs before they can begin to think at all about removing thousands of pounds for something like simply coming to the dormitories.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
An unarmed youth was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come stand up and say, "Rocks up, don't shoot" while they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, about the murder of Michael Brown's unarmed teenager, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments placed gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions increased in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the responses of white women, who concentrated 100 per cent on race.
In comparison with the reaction of black women shortly after the assassination of 9 August, personal essays with titles such as “Ferguson thoughts on behalf of a white woman” and “Feminism is not just about oppression of women” were relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis we're faced with, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so racially attached, they felt they should be pointed out.
For a professor of English at the University of Ohio, Corita Mitchell Ferguson revealed the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as “women's issues” in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'll get 150 swearers all over the place," Mitchell says.
When I write something about color people being attacked in their own country, silence makes me deaf.
"Why are women safe to talk about relationships in public, but not about public safety?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share those problems; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women are now uniting issues of race and gender in the Feminist Mainty, Angela Hettery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"In 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and rape of a white woman was almost always behind it," he told.
I needed a white woman to confirm the story to justify lynching.
From Hetter's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white Sufragivists, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for electoral rights would be effective only for one of the groups: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in the women's vote basket, and the Blacks' right to vote was to come later," Hetter said.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women had attained voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchings with the South Women ' s Association for the Prevention of Lynchvous.
The group appeared nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, says Mitchell.
From Mitchell's point of view, the rise in the response of white feminists to the problems raised by Ferguson's situation - police behaviour and racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to “take care of” the problems that black women had dealt with in several generations.
"Yes, it would be great if activists who have such a [traditional] feminist ideology took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do to the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second wave feminists who have made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
A prominent white feminist activist, Gloria Steine, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, used Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take part in more protests about racism.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason for understanding the dangers of the body - and views on racial issues that are significantly different in public surveys - will be at the head of change," wrote Stynem.
Although Stinem is fighting for a more cross-cutting feminism that includes both race and gender, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
A researcher at the American Institute of Business, Christine Sommers, author of "Who Stealed Feminism?", said that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, "are more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinem's footnotes about Ferguson contradict the criticism she had previously expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, "Look out for my brother", to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking boys, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stynem.
Police relations with the Black Community are not the only problem that promotes the front line of traditional feminism.
Following the arrest by the U.S. Border Guard of some 63,000 minors on the south-west border of the country this year, immigration reform has returned to the surface - this time the problem of women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that she had only to share the stories of immigrant women in order to present the problem as important to women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued [to male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in positions that are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are answered by women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich's house is sold with pigs.
A picture of a house set up for sale in Saffelka was removed by real estate agents when it was shown to be a large pig resting in the living room.
A separate house with one bedroom is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was characterized by a photograph of the living room - where a pig with a head resting on the couch was depicted.
Connells' Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the photograph was the pet owner of the house.
“However, the photograph has been placed by mistake and has already been removed”, reported the representative of the company.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as "a unique separate house with one bedroom."
Although the agency removed the photo from its website, it was still in advertising.
The sale of homes has aroused interest in social media, where some have asked if pigs are sold along with the house.
Russian tennisist Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of US Open, the retreating Carolyn Woznitski believes she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish a year and try to get to a new level, handing over Vasili O.S.O.V. from New York.
How do you generally rate your results at the Big helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won at Rollan Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I did not have enough stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't even get to the fourth.
What tasks do you set before the end of the season?
After the injury, I have a strong motivation to take on a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year.
The Asian tour series starts in a couple of weeks.
Member of the Committee of the State on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nicholas Walouev, suggested that the TEAP should be given bonus when entering university.
He said that, in general, the standards would be the same as those of the Soviet era, and people would pass the standards by traction, running and other exercises.
We will recall that 12 Russian entities will start implementing TEAP standards on their territory as of 1 September.
I also encouraged school students who had given up TEF to give bonus when they went to college, ” Walouev noted.
For example, they can add some points to the EGE.
There are also proposals to provide additional terminations to employees of enterprises who have undergone these sports tests.
In Harvey town in South Wales, there was a new millionaire after winning the lottery.
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
We're looking for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million from the lottery game on Saturday night.
The Harvey Newsstand brings gold at the top of the prize for the second time in five years, last winning $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner has yet to declare himself.
The owner of the store, Steve Forvard, said that the winner had caused a frenzy in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought it might be a secret win.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the prize-winning prize last month, noting the completion of several good weeks for state players.
Last week, the Canning Veil player became one of the five million million people in August, following a huge $7.5 million winning couple from Belmont just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple have been playing for 20 years and have reported that winning has given them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey millionaire brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total benefit of $85 million.
The minidevelopment wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market.
This week, the Minéconomé will introduce into the Government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, as described by the Director of the Department of the Ministry of Oleg Plotnik, on a round table held by the “Knows” on the Moscow Autosalon - 2014.
The plan was commissioned by the Government and one of the main objectives was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document was expected to be adopted at the end of September - early October, he said that the proposed measures related to electric vehicles and hybrids - there was already a plan for the development of vehicles on gas motor fuels in Russia.
The plan (a copy is available from the "News") is for 2014-2017.
The criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport and how to promote the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles are to be developed.
A report to the Government describing tax and customs support measures for electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a concessionary and concessionary lease scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce car prices, stimulate localization and establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, legal and regulatory changes are planned to facilitate the construction of a charging infrastructure (in parking, fuel stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to propose to the regional authorities during 2015 that they should also encourage the use of clean transport - in the form of an advantage in traffic and parking, for example; and, by February 2016, in the form of proposals to increase public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Mineconomy would have added criteria to the list of indicators for the assessment of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of support for cleaner transport production and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is only being formed - in 2013, about 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty for electric vehicles was empty, so sales would be about 500, predicting the main executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric vehicles any visible: in 2013, in Russia, according to the Association of European Business, 2.78 million cars and light commercial cars were sold.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors have imported electric vehicles into Russia.
The import is being prepared by Renault, a company focused primarily on corporate clients, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renoult in Russia, Nicolas Remis.
Most of the other electric transport producers have taken a waiting attitude towards Russia.
Russian manufacturers also have "", GAZ, "", but the output is tiny.
For example, in January and July 2014, according to ASM Holding, AVTWAZ released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low because of the cost of electric vehicles, and the Director of the AVTWAZA for Engineering, Sergei Amani, will not be able to...
The development of the Russian market for electric vehicles, in addition to the expensive car (the electric vehicles sold in Russia, on average, twice as expensive as internal combustion engines) inhibits the indevelopment of the charging infrastructure (fuels units) by the director of the autostat, Sergei Scelikov.
Due to the costly and low rate of reduction in the cost of electric vehicles, Mikhail Travelanski is expected to remain a niche segment of the Russian market in the next three to four years.
By contrast, manufacturers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional vehicles.
Russia's electric car market has good prospects, and above all, to inspire confidence in consumers that “electricity” is real; this will be facilitated, inter alia, by the emergence of new charging stations, as stressed by the President of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are carried out, for example, by the State Company Rossetti: Moscow has built several stations, and some 80 more will soon be available.
Negotiations are under way on the construction of a gas station network with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofiin, director of Rosset, the company believes in the electricity market and is willing to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of different brands.
In addition, Rosnet, as a network company, is not authorized to sell electricity, and the opportunity is being explored to do so with respect to electrical charges.
The Pankov considers the most effective measure of lordly support for the establishment in Russia of the market for electric vehicles to be the clearance of customs duties.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it, extending the grace list, is being explored.
The replacement of the transport tax on environmental (the idea is discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, says Pankov.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where tax cuts have resulted in a sharp increase in the sale of electric vehicles - now accounting for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for car owners, such as free parking in the centre of the city (as already done in Moscow), sure Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles along marked lanes, which Russia does not yet have.
A private aircraft crashed in Colorado
Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado, U.S.A.
Three of the five people in it are dead, passing on ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident took place several kilometres from the airstrip of Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being determined.
In Donetsk province, prisoners of the Donbas Battalion are being dealt with.
The guards were surrounded by Ilowaysk.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of soldiers were killed under fire.
Survivors say that if they knew what the situation in south-east Ukraine really was, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners are lucky.
The Donbas Battalion was left alive after the meatmeat they were caught under Ilowaysk.
In the vicinity of the Donetsk People ' s Republic army, the militants spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and the Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from headquarters that the ring could be removed from the alleged corridor, the column moved.
But literally in a couple of minutes, there were shells and bullets on all sides.
"Now we've been allowed to leave on the basis of the information I've been given, we've been allowed to leave," says the Deputy Commander of the Battalion with a call for Leermonts.
And when we got down between the Multipolio and the Redselkie, a cross-fire broke out from anti-tank-controlled missiles, “traps”, 30-millimetre grenades, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars ahead of me, and there were three cars behind me, and then there were only two cars left.
The officer with the Leermont call tells us that almost immediately at least 60 people were killed, dozens were injured, and many died later.
Survivors are now being treated by those they have come to kill.
Now prisoners are surprised that so-called "terrorists" treat them well, provide food, medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and sentenced them to death.
We were simply betrayed, they say.
The entire battalion, so they can destroy it.
As with many of his companions, Alexei was a volunteer in the Donbas battalion because the Ukrainian news reported atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east by “separatists”.
Alexei's already seen a different picture.
His mother in Luganska was killed, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that mortar fire was coming, that it was most likely the Ukrainian armed forces,” says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
They didn't let us out of Ilowaysk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already made arrangements with the commander, and the report has already been written about the departure.
We were taken to Ilowaysk from the congregation fees with Zurahova.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in the "cottle" of Ilowaysk.
Some survivors now admit that if time could be turned back, they would not join the punitive battalion for anything.
All the prisoners were handed over to the DDP forces.
Everyone is checked for involvement in war crimes.
A food price limitation headquarters has been established in the region
A headquarters has been established in the Krasnoyar province to limit, if necessary, the increase in the prices of products on the market in the region.
A decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the province ' s Government, representatives of the executive branch and oversight agencies.
Together, they will monitor agricultural prices in the province.
Vesty Economy – Will Kiev compensate $140 million for its losses?
Igor Sechin, head of Rosnefti, stated that the company estimates the damage caused by the shooting of Lisichan NPAs in Ukraine at $140 million.
That's what he said in an interview with Spiegel.
“We estimate the damage of $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government for compensation,” said Sechin.
According to him, the implementation of the modernized Lisichangi NPA was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting, there were no `unscraped rebels'," but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, technological oil had been lost and had been pumped into the pipes,” he said.
We will recall that on 18 July, in connection with the shooting of the Lisician NZ, the oil storage tank was burned down and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
The Lisician NPA, the main refinery in Ukraine, was first introduced into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisician NPA is about 7 million tons of petroleum raw materials per year.
The plant is able to produce the fuel of the Euro-4 standard as well as the diesel batch of the Euro-5 standard.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichan NPA were suspended owing to its loss.
The company decided to start repairing.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichan NPA along with other Ukrainian assets of TNC-XB.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Japan Sea.
According to South Korean media, this occurred around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
As told by Interfax in the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, the rocket reportedly fell into the Japanese Sea after flying some 220 kilometres.
The ruble falls against the background of geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar increased by 3 cop to 37.15 roubles, the rouble fell to a bi-currency basket in the face of geopolitical tension.
The dollar exchange on ETC was initiated at the borders of 37.11 to 37.2 roubles/$1, on average, in two minutes, the rate was 37.16 roubles/$1, which is 4 cops above the level of the previous closure.
The euro rate was 48.79 roubles per euro, which is 3 cop above the level of the previous closure.
The price of the basket was added by 3.5 cops and amounted to 42.395 roubles.
The United States dollar is traded 23 times the official rate, and the euro is 16 times the official rate.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but this time there was no panic.
He has continued to make it cheaper and rouble and has even updated the historic dollar ceiling.
Investors are already in advance of the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
For the time being, however, it's more like artificial hysteria blown through the media, especially the Western ones.
The options for introducing new sanctions on the Russian Federation are not so many.
Teletrade "At the opening of the Moscow Rubl Exchange, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, unless we see a new negative soon, both Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
The Orenburg Airlines will be sued with the Ideal Tour.
The Orenburg Airlines filed claims for a total of 4.7 billion roubles.
These are two cases that will take place in October.
There will be different judges to handle cases.
According to Interfax, the first claim was filed on 14 August.
It's worth just over 425 million rubles.
It is scheduled for 7 October.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
It's $4.24 billion rubles.
It is scheduled for 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Union, industrial tours have been assigned different judges.
In July, information about the “Ideal-Tur” debt owed to the Orenburg Avillions amounted to 1.5 billion roubles.
The director of the airline, Victor Zukin, is talking about a sum of 1.6 billion rubles.
Vitaly Savelev, director of the Aeroflot, calls it an even higher amount, two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to get more interesting for new users
Twitter micro-blogging has changed the process of user registration to involve new participants more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their micro-blogging.
New Twitter users will now be looking at a large number of accounts recommended by the service at the time of registration to form their own readership.
The recommendations shall be based on those indicated in the registration of interests.
Twitter will automatically check the subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
This will make it necessary for the user to take a hand-marker so that he does not read to those who are not interested.
If previously only recommended users saw microblog users, Twitter now prints a sample of one of the blogger's popular Twitters to help make an impression of the human being.
This is the biggest change in Twitter registration over the last three years.
Twitter has been actively working on the modernization of the service lately.
This activity is primarily linked to ongoing attempts by the service to achieve a level of failure.
In 2014, the microblogging service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a decline in the activity of readers.
At this point, the company desperately needs more loyal consumer resources, which, once in a while, would remain long.
Only in this way can there be a steady flow of advertising tools.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be smooth and rainy
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy all day, reports meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow is between 16 and 18 degrees, and in Podmoskovy - 13 to 18 degrees.
When the weather is clear, it will rain in the weather, and the wind in the east quarter will be quite weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
Vehicle reclamation programme resumed on 1 September
Since 1 September, the car recycling programme has been re-established in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles would be allocated for this purpose.
The head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, Denis Mantourov, explained that money was allocated from the limits that had already been delivered to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redeployment from other areas of support.
The programme will cover all vehicles over six years of age.
The amount of compensation would range from 40,000 per car to 350,000 rouble per truck.
A similar car recycling programme had already been in place in Russia.
The main difference in the current project, the Minister explained, is that it is now envisaged that not only the disposal of the rebuffing machines, but also the possibility, if the car has reached the age of six years, of acquiring a new discount at the time the old one was handed over to the dealer by Interfax.
The previous federal recycling programme, which had been in force from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, had spent over 16 billion roubles.
As a result, car production in 2010 was about 1.2 million (this plus 101.4 per cent compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game of modern journalism.
Heimsiner Nikki Case, famous for playing Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game of modern journalism.
He told me about his project in a Kill View interview.
Case started work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has been widely known only now.
A source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where protests began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be on how the coverage of stories affects their effects.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will have to take a picture of what is happening in areas where police and population clashes are taking place.
The hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which will affect what's going on.
If he films the scene so that the police appear to be heroes and the protestors are bandits, the police will start treating him better and letting him go where the ordinary person can't go.
If he highlights events differently, his photographs can turn peaceful protests into a major rebellion.
The points in the game will have to be dialed with a Twitter of the hero, where new subscribers will appear if the photographs presented there are popular.
The game has not yet been named.
The date and platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how the event could change depending on how the photograph was taken and processed.
In an interview, Kill Eight Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for quite some time, but initially wanted to devote it not to protests in the United States but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, he realized that he lacked knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media covering the events in Ferguson, he decided to play on the basis of what had happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
The most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which describes events in Case's curriculum vitae, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to tell homophobic parents about his relationship.
Heletius drags Ukraine into the blood
The call to prepare for the next “ten thousand” victims by the Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Valery Géletei, draws the people to the continuation of the bloody struggle, as stated in the communication of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Göletei, who stated that “the completion of the operation for the liberation of the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the Great Domestic War, which would be counted as “ten thousand”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military agency, which published the post on its Facebook page, a subject for research not in the military field, is stated in a report by Russian diplomats.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “The Russian side has threatened several times through informal channels that, if resistance continues, they are prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons against us”.
In doing so, he stated that the “operation for the liberation of eastern Ukraine” had been completed.
Perez Hilton removed all intimate images of the stars and apologized.
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars are terrified.
The hackers hacked the primitive passwords into iCloud in smartphones, and then their intimate images appeared on Perez Hilton's blogger website.
It's true, not for long.
Recall that Jennifer Lawrence, the official of the Star of the Hunger Games, has already reported the theft of photographs from her cell phone and has confirmed that all the images that “sow” in the Network are genuine.
Perez Hilton, the creator of a single-name tabloid site, apologized to the actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues at the shop for publishing their frank images, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do it.
Their agents didn't contact me.
And now I'm going to delete the frank pictures of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," wrote a blogger on Twitter.
However, all the frank images of the stars have already spread over the network.
David Beckham was involved in an accident, hiding from Paparazzi
David Beckham was involved in a motorcycle accident, sleeping from Paparazzia.
It happened in Los Angeles at the turn of the Sunset Bulvar.
A British football player broke apart by slamming and stretching the muscles of his right hand.
Beckham came out of the daddy Salon, where he was expected to be a paparazzi.
Fleeing from their persecution on his motorcycle, he failed to manage and fell, writing TMZ with reference to sources close to football.
As a result, Bekham was hit, and the muscles of his right hand were stretched and scratched.
Tony Stuart suffers from an accident when he comes back to the track.
Tony Stuart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart hit the wall a second time after his right front tyre broke down on 172 circles, ending his performance.
Stuart took his stuffed car to the garage and then went out without talking to the reporters.
The leader of his team, Chad Johnston, said that the 14 members of the team were upset but would now focus on the next weekend race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a more successful attempt and a more successful finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we'll do better there.
Stuart first hit the wall earlier on Sunday night, after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repair on the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty great hope of coming to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "just didn't work."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded onto the truck, and the team was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Spring Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during the groundroad race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to take part in the persecution.
He returned to work during the investigation of the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went on the road to complain to Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the investigation of the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
No decision was taken as to whether Stuart would be charged.
The three - time champion was met with loud shouts and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting at 12th position, Stuart walked at the first 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching the fourth position.
Then 122 circles after Bush's restaurant.
The car 18 got off the track at the exit of turn 2 and hit Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart continued, but got behind 21st position.
Sovczak and Witorgan have cigarettes with Zwanecki in Odessa
Xenia Sobczak and Maxim Witorg are now in Odessa, which the television conductor has not failed to report in her Instagram.
True, one photograph surprised and confused the couple.
Image taken from Zwanecki.
"At breakfast at Mikhail Mikhalić Zwanecki Maxim explains what an instagram:) #Odessa," signed the photograph of Xenia Sobčak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, buns, butter, etc.
The couple decided that Ksusha was smoking too, and they condemned her for it.
"Whose cigarettes? "Court Kills!", "What's a cigarette breakfast?", "It's like breakfast, but only cigarettes)) ", "Kseniya, are you smoking too?", "they were excited about their favorite followers of her blog.
Remember, Sobczak recently boasted of the delicious meal he had prepared for her for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the cottage, and your husband has prepared dinner for you (for the first time for married life, which is good for you.) "It's good for you not to say at the end of the meal, "that it should be like this every day," and boasted of your husband, Xenia Sobchak.
You can see from the picture that Maxim is working hard on something, and there's salt and baked chicken on the table.
The prison officers of Bulgaria conducted a national protest campaign
Hundreds of prison officers from across Bulgaria conducted a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in Sofia's capital.
During a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for a return to their former working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Salaries are also included in the list of claims to be discussed with the Acting Minister of Justice, Christ Ivanov.
During the month, officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the prison service union has met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, the agreement has not been reached, as reported by the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are continuing, as reported by the head of the General Directorate for the Enforcement of Sentences, Rosen Zhelnad.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join in the protest of the Prison Service Union.
The army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Prait (right) appointed the Minister of Defence, Herit Wongsuwan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers, in which more than one third of the posts were held by retired generals or generals.
The army has been given key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was officially confirmed as Prime Minister following the official approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the head of the interim military Government.
A 60-year-old military officer who took over power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on 22 May was the only candidate for the Prime Minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed members of Parliament.
According to Prauta Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which the protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Jinglak Chinawat.
Officially, Chang-Ocha will be a temporary prime minister, as the military plan to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
against the background of complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military took office, they temporarily arrested the leading politicians of the country, including Prime Minister Jinglik Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is taking root in 2006, when the army removed Brother Jinglik Chinawat Taxin from his post as Prime Minister.
Both enjoy popularity among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has often ensured their success in the elections.
However, many middle class and capital elite members have joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralysed the country since November 2013.
Nobody's ever told me it's better in the Media salad. I didn't promise you that.
It must be formally acknowledged that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain inviolable.
It's been known for a long time that we're saying "Belgium" -- we're referring to Media -- we're saying "Belgium."
Restaurators like to say thoughtfully that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There are places that aren't good, they're good, but they're not.
In short, when I sat down at the Palm table, I remembered that there was once a City Café (in honor of the same television program), then a Odessa Mama, and then a Bogole restaurant and a beer friendship.
It's a beer here again, but it's nostalgic-Soviet, it's Belgian.
The only place above the ground was the tip of the iceberg — the bar stash and a pair of tables, all the rest of the space missing even the hint of sunlight.
But it's fun here in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, multicolored chairs, instead of windows, televisions where the girls swim.
Belgian institutions in Petersburg have long been out of touch, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of spilling beer (260-300 roubles per 0.5 l) and countless bottles (170-1550 roubles).
The company-positive waitress introduces the menu cheerfully, telling us that "Medias are fatty big seeds," and it should be noted that it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is, the most positive side of Palm.
Menu expected according to content, but often very unexpectedly.
For example, for whom it is given to guess that a meat roll with a Walloon plumber (280 roubles) is actually carpachecho, cut in a way so thin that parchment paper, compared to it, would appear to be a kind of matter that is so thick.
You can only feel any taste if you're heating up half a man together.
The lettuce is worse.
Classical Leszic (260) is best recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: some smelly iceberg once cooked a long time ago, a potato, a Kenyan beans, bacon chips, plus some pickled onions.
You're not going to want to meet anyone with such a lazi salad!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If it was still possible to close your eyes to the immature quarters of the cherries or the overheated shamignons, why would the almonds look as if they had been able to unfrozen and uncooked several times in their lifetime!
I already know that there are quite normal Belomorian almonds!
They're served in pots "in a sauce on your choice" (490-560 roubles per 0.5 kg).
The half a dozen sauces, the white wine, the saltery and the carrots, didn't go straight.
Vegetables are eaten and the aroma is not there, and wine is still a mystery.
But good copper-based fries with home-based mayonnaise.
The chicken water supply here is not a flattening, so thick that depending on your mood, you can decide whether the first or second dish is in front of you, but it's just a nice plumbing soup.
It was said that the rabbit was prepared in a beer sauce, and there was no mention of a rosemary.
On the floor, the situation turned out to be the opposite: Rosemary silenced everything.
The rabbit seemed to have been fed exclusively with rosemary shrubs during his lifetime, making the meat so unusual.
But at the same time, the rabbit's leg was attached to a wonderful -- no, it's just a great pear in a caramelized short.
Palm waffles are offered not only sweet but also fat with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
Maple sauce turned out to be too watery, and waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table asked very informally for a meal.
So we should come back again.
The dollar rate has risen to 37 roubles on news of new West sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar was calculated tomorrow by 10:29 ablutions by 26.9 roubles and was 37.02 roubles, and the euro was raised by 30 roubles to 48.73 roubles, as shown by the Moscow Exchange.
The basket grew 28 copies to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 roubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum of 36.43 rubles at that time on 19 February 2009 and 37.005 roubles on 3 March 2014.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that U.S. President Barack Obama and German chancellor Angel Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The drying of the rub is long-term, coupled with the euro and the dollar.
The long-term forecast had to do with this, says senior analyst Anna Bodrov.
Anything related to Ukraine will, in one way or another, be affected by the course.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, rumours about military incursions are not confirmed on either side, but the market has proved to be very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news was turned off yesterday.
The week is projected to close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, gas transit through Ukraine is all one chain.
Inflation is also projected: between 5 and 10 per cent of current prices per autumn.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will soon end, and there will be a vacuum as networks shift to other suppliers.
“Dollar came to the mark of 37 rubles, went through it and returned, there was no strong hysteria,” comments the head of the Market Analysis Division, "The Broker" by Constantine Bushev.
It will still be seen whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The Rubl, he said, was severely weakened after the tax season had ended, followed by news in Ukraine, and last week the CB stated that by the end of the year it was fully moving towards a floating rate and refusing any exchange rate intervention.
When you look at day-to-day fluctuations, they were no different from the previous ones during this month, and they're all scared by the 37 rubles, and they're still an analyst.
So nothing big happened in terms of traffic.
The alarming times for the currency market were, I recall, when demand for currency rose at the end of January, as well as the third March, when the CB downloaded a record number of currencies.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the yaw relaxing.
First of all, this increase in the revenue from export operations, as well as the competitiveness of domestic producers through higher import costs, says top analyst UPS IC Alexei Kozlov.
The travel of imported goods and services may be negative.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, stimulate inflationary pressures and, as a result, increase the cost of borrowing money, which in turn hinders the country ' s economy.
When it comes to the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble has somewhat reduced the price of the shares expressed in the rubles.
For example, the MBIB index fell by 1.67 per cent during the Thursday tender, while the RTA index lost 3.27 per cent.
This significant difference in the relative reduction of indices is due to the loss of ruby during the day by more than 1.5 per cent.
The weakening of the rub is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy currency.
As practice has shown, emotions gradually fade, and the rouble’s quoting partially or completely restores lost positions.
“We believe we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near 36 rubles per dollar,” says Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years thinking that she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharko-Marie-Tuta (SMT), a group of hereditary disorders that cause nerve damage outside the brain and the spinal cord.
The KMT UK charity reported that the misdiagnosed is a frequent problem among people with SMTs because they know so little about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are said to have CMTs that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, unreliable walking, and naked toes.
Patients may experience burnout or pain, and their condition is not cured and progresses, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13 years old, she thought she was suffering from Friedrich's (AF) attack, a condition that was very bad.
Rogers thought she would be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and would die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew as a child that I couldn't do what others did.
I fell every day, and I had more time for everything.
I've never been able to ride a video or a skateboard with other kids, and I've been messed up at school for walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after a few operations to release the Achilles tendon and turn her feet, she looked into the medical records when her doctor came out of the room and it was written that she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn't be, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, I found information about this state in the library, and I wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and I had the worst panic ever.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my powers in this space.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she knew that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and she asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you're having this disease because you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you've got something that poses a much smaller threat to your life.
After several genetic tests, she found SMTs.
"When he explained what SMT was, I thought I had pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The U.S.S.S.F.A. has announced a month of information on SMTs to try to draw attention to this disease.
Tax burden on Washington zone entrepreneurs increases as the economy recovers
A restored economy means more clients, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies across the country increased moderately last year, when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington Zone were no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia combined $27.6 billion in state and local treasuries in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local business increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent earlier, and this was the third consecutive year after successive years when the accounts decreased in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent more than local taxes, 3.9 per cent more than local taxes, according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernest & Young and the State Tax Centre, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenue in the district, 56 per cent, is taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax revenue is taxed by firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, generates the least tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to the return to the company ' s continued value, say researchers, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years, when growth was less than 1 per cent.
While large states, such as California, New York and Texas, account for a large share of these revenues, it seems to be the same in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia combined $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent over the previous year.
However, there is no similar effect on the return of real estate income in the state and at the local level in Maryland, where real estate taxes are barely higher than one fifth of the tax accounts of companies.
Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half the State and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to a non-profit organization that does not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on, for example, income taxes to pay the same services as other states.
The recent increase in tax revenue from entrepreneurs cannot be fully attributed to the restoration of the real estate market.
Business incomes also seem to be being adjusted according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared a corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income from income tax, most of all in the region.
While trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Colombia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was much faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average of 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, there was the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia, taxes for state and local entrepreneurs are lower and generally a more favourable climate for business taxes than in Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in the study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation reducing the corporate rate from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, as in Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to achieve tax revenue targets next year, this law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs even to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington Zone seem to be feeling better and thus pay more State and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid in the form of individual income tax for small business owners, a transitional structure that provides most small firms - in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher growth rate than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in income from business taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with the revenue from State and local taxes increasing by 6.2 per cent over the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may lag behind, as the decline in federal spending has an impact on the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of the Russian Judo
The judo World Home Championship brought two silver and seven bronze prizes to Russia.
The Russians gave up this indicator only the main winning of the competition, Japan's prefabricated competition.
The tournament in Chelabinsk started on Monday, and the first day he brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
It was owned by Beslan the Wise, up to 60 kg.
However, in an equal final battle against Baldbaatar Ganbat of Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was only one comment received by the Russian.
The second day of the tournament was the most successful for Russia's congregated country - three medals were won on Tuesday.
In male competitions, up to 66 kg of silver was obtained by Mikhail Pulaev and bronze by Kamal Khan-Mgomedov.
In final consultation, the Russian gave way to the 2011 and 2013 Japan peace champion Masasi Ebinum.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost his compatriot in the fourth stage, passed through a comfort tournament and became the holder of a bronze prize.
In a women's tournament of up to 52 kg, too, up to the third step of the pedestal, Natalie Kuzutin was honored.
In the semi-finals, she lost the active World Cup of Mailinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who was flying the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully defended the title.
In the bronze dispute, Kuzutina won from Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she had hoped for.
Once again, the obstacle to Russia’s golden gold was Kelmendi, who had defeated Kusuutina earlier in the European championship.
On the third day in Chelyabinsk, bronze was placed in a piece of prefabricated Russia by Musa Moshkov, who fought in a category of up to 73 kg.
In the fourth quarter, he was offended by former Moldovan representative Victor Skovortsov, who is now in favour of the UAE team.
But then the Russian won two fights and became the owner of the prize.
He was performing at the home championship with the trauma of the nunstop he's planning to heal soon, so he's gonna take a break in the competition.
As for the ex-Moldovan Squartsov, he and he got to the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots who had accepted the UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, completed a class of up to 100 kg with bronze.
The fourth day of CMM-2014 also brought to the Russians one bronze that Ivan Nihont had conquered in the category of up to 81 kg.
In the heavy battle of the little finale, he won a Frenchman named Alan Schmitt with a comment from a rival.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at the tournament, but the Russians were traditionally confined to one bronze in a male tournament up to 90 kg.
Cyril’s questions became his owner, and Russia’s collected medal was guaranteed: his rival at the consoling finale was a compatriot with Cyril Denisov.
However, the interception did not take place: the opponents of the Question were unable to reach their fathers because of the trauma.
The men's bronze was conquered by the owners and, on the sixth day of the competition, it was placed in a piece of prefabricated pen by Renat Said, who was in the category of more than 100 kg.
In a comforting finale, he won a pure victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus the individual part of world domination came to an end.
On the last day of the Cellabinsk tournament, Sunday, the world championships were playing at team competitions.
The two Russian- speaking men and women were among the main applicants for the prize, but as in individual competitions, women of beautiful gender were not lucky; they had not reached the medal.
And then the Russian Judaists won the command silver.
In a decisive confrontation, they took over Japan ' s main competition favours, the Japanese team, in a hard fight against account 2-3.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 following the net victory of Khan Magomedov and the left, Denise Jartsov (up to 73 kg).
However, in heavier weight categories, Mourat Habachev (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope with their Japanese rivals.
In the same scenario, a bronze match developed in a women's tournament, where the Russian prefabricated two-to-one replaced the Japanese two-to-three.
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, attended the team competitions in Chelabinsk and congratulated the male team on the silver at the end of the tournament.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could be champions," said Putin, whose words are quoted by RIA News.
There's nothing wrong with the Japanese, the judo's parents.
But I'm sure you can win them.
The Russian national championship at the World Cup was much better than it was a year ago at a level like that held in Rio de Janeiro.
At the time, the Russian team had only three medals, one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was passed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstian and Mansour Isaev.
We're all big perfectionists, of course.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is part of the eight strongest, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
Even more so in a form of sport such as judo," the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation, Vitaly Mutko, quoted by the champion's press service.
Japan’s collection was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of varying dignity, five of which turned golden.
The next world championship will take place next summer in Astana.
Other material, news, and statistics can be found on the summer sports page.
The Joan Rivers Family Hopes for the Best
Joan Rivers is unconscious when she arrived at the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed the hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress would recover from illness.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in her statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday following an emergency call that she had a heart arrest at the Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, reports sources.
The doctors deliberately keep her under drug abuse and strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “heavy”.
The response was broad, including extensive Internet support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Everyone can be kings.
The debut album of Royal Blad is a new hope of the British year that led the rock duets out of the clubs straight into the stadiums.
Dueta Royal Blood is on stage for a year, but he's already on the move for a BBC musical prize, an Arctic Monkeys hot-start tour, and a New York concert show visit by Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut album, a few months before the release, had received 100,000 orders, and the contract for its release was in the portfolio of Major label Warner Music.
Given the current sad situation in the music market, this is not the new Lana Del Rey, or the new sweet word for "new R'n'B", but the duet of British bulls, playing with the volume and intensity that was the last time in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the first album rates for all the above circumstances were particularly high and had already been justified.
Dueta has taken for granted a name that might have been affected before, except for the desperate metalworkers, and the blood of what kings seems to be flowing in their veins, too, is understandable.
This, of course, is primarily about the heroes at the last level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood is designed to shake up the stagnant blood of the British year, bringing it to a new height.
It may be too early to predict the success of the enterprise, but something can already be confirmed.
A dozen songs in thirty minutes are not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composite gift as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of individual numbers cannot be denied, for example, the pilot single "Out of The Black" is characteristic of the drum band rather than the melodic line.
Musicians are joking to say that this song is easier to knock than to drink.
Also worth highlighting is the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing plate of "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
But the truth is, each of these songs will sound great at a heavy-year party, but when they're played in a row, they come together in a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it's not necessarily bad, even vice versa.
Royal Blood's power is that they don't claim to be laurels of new Lennon and McCarthy (rather than to be the successors of Motörehead), but they have brought many rock duts out of the ghettos of the Indies Clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, is designed for stadiums, in a room of fewer than a few thousand people, it is obvious that it is close.
The secret is partly the subtle use of bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format invented at the beginning of zero The White Stripes.
But it's not just about the instruments, it's about the composition of the songs.
The heroes of the zerolings had to struggle to move beyond the post-technical paradigm, with great reluctance to acknowledge themselves not only as epigons but as independent creative units.
The sound of Royal Blad is so powerful and can be heard that it has been successful in scratching some of the secondaryity and hardness of the music.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: The Online Store - and Video Producer, and a hundred other things - buys the Twitch stream service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news was a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination was natural.
Twitch, based just three years ago as Justin.tv, set out to be a flow service of a general nature, a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their game moments; "YouTube for real-time games," according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a film genre where all-knowing people play -- mostly old -- processing games, like in "The Mysterious Theatre" -- are already popular on YouTube.
The thing is, YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met with no interest, a classic example of a deep-rooted technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was said to be willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from the Executive Director, Twitch Emmett Shire, saying, "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Scounds like me who say they'll do better than watch sports, it's hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of taking a joystick into their own hands.
One thing is to look through the shoulder of a friend at 3 a.m. when she slips through Resident Evil, and another thing is to watch someone else get 20 shots in the head of the Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling the angle of view on your own may be a recipe for the main pain worth Do It Right.
I agree that the high-speed walk where the Rogers of the Bennisters of our electronic century end up playing all kinds of games at record times is fun.
But if it's not the virtuosis of play or humor, it's unlikely that his channel Twitch will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics know about me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and that's the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How does Amazon make it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will turn into Amazon Institute Video just as beautifully as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
But Twitch has something that any company would enjoy: a bunch of young men that advertisers dream of.
As chapter Twitch Shire said, Amazon and Twitch both believe in the future of the game, and this channel does not offer signs of insensibility, even--oh--like a spectacular sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed in the 2004 terrorist attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to surviving hostages -- almost all students now with the parents of the deceased, the cemetery watcher -- the City of Angelov, Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of Mothers Beslan's committee, Susan Dudiev, who participated in the special operation by a Ministry officer, relates Elizabeth Antonov's Community correspondent who worked on the special project.
On their return to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who, 10 years ago, was an adviser to the President for the North Caucasus and negotiated with the terrorists, as well as with Russian FSB officer Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What was particularly shocking to me since I was working on this topic is that in Beslan, it was as if there had been none of these ten years.
It is a very painful topic for all who have any connection with it, and it is difficult for people to agree to talk about what has happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," Antonov said.
A special project has been prepared by a studio of colder & Co., which has been employed by a company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to World War I and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
The DPRK launched a short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range rocket into the Japanese Sea, reports Renhap.
The launch took place around 10.30 a.m. local time from Chagando Province, on the border between North Korea and China.
The rocket reportedly fell into the Japan Sea, flying some 220 kilometres, and declared before the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
Member States proposed accelerating the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, the Russians will not be stored on servers abroad as of 1 January 2015
A draft law has been introduced in the State of the State, which provides for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is located in the legislative framework of the lower chamber.
It was sponsored by Vice-Chairmen Vadim Dygin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Eugenius Fedorov ("One Russia"), Vladimir Parahin ("Right Russia") and Alexander Yushenko (CPRF).
Such a change, according to the sponsors of the initiative, would help to ensure more quickly and effectively the rights of the citizens of the Russian Federation to the security of personal data and to respect the confidentiality of communications and communication networks.
The Act, whose entry into force is hastened by parliamentarians, requires that Russian personal data processed on the Internet be stored in the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, maintain, clarify and extract personal data of Russian citizens in databases located on Russian territory and to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of Russian personal data law by a court decision.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called “black lists” of abusers' websites, an automated information system “Registration of violators of the rights of personal data entities”.
This law was passed by the Lord's Office in the summer.
The draft was sponsored by Andrei Lugova and Wadim Dahgin of LDPR and Alexander Yushenko of CRC.
Moneygin and Yushenko are also among the sponsors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who don't have data centres in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent.
Commenting on the draft bill introduced in the State Duma today, the first sub-heading of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, stated that he saw no problem in moving the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
He said that those companies that, by 1 January 2015, would not have their own Russian personal data warehouses in the territory of the Russian Federation would be able to rent them, for example, “Rosecom”, which had repeatedly said that they were willing to lease their servers and already provide their servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies that are now providing their servers”.
“In addition, there are several independent data centres willing to cooperate in this field,” he added.
“If companies decide to enforce the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problem - they will have technological opportunities for accommodation”, said Levin.
Controversial Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed its concern that, if the bill was adopted, the Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
These include on-line air travel services and hotels.
According to the association, “the bill deprives the entities of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data - of the mandatory determination that their recording, systematization, etc. should be ensured only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of where the recording is done, to systematize his personal data.
In that case, it would be possible to choose which territory the actions would be carried out.
The adoption of such laws on “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the departure of global services and significant economic losses.
The victim of the ice-water test had her jaw dislodged

Over 400 prisoners were handed over to the Ukrainian military
In the Novorossiyah Army, the Ukrainian Su-27 is alleged to have been shot down and the enemy is accused of violating the ceasefire agreement.
As of 10 a.m. on 1 September, prisoners were handed over to the Ukrainian side 402 of them, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by the spokesman for the Novorossia Army.
He added that “the Su-27 aircraft, in violation of the ceasefire arrangements, had been shot down by air defence forces in the vicinity of Mereska”.
According to the Agency ' s interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions in shelling the Lugan airport.
The spokesman for the press noted that the militia had managed to damage two Ukrainian Air Force helicopters during the night at a field airfield, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
“The loss of life by the enemy - up to a hundred people killed and injured - captured 13 people”, summarized the staff representative.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the “people's republics” of Donbasa announced the transfer of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side as part of the implementation of the ceasefire.
At the same time, at night, the NDP army, according to the Novorossia Army, “presented to try to remove heavy equipment from the area of the environment by the Nazi-Guardian people, in violation of previous agreements”.
At that time the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 troops.
According to headquarters, the total loss of enemy in all directions (Dontec, Luhansk, Mariulsk) during that night amounted to five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian troops found themselves surrounded by militias in the Ilowaysk district of Donetsk province.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia asked the leadership of the “people's republics” to release Ukrainian soldiers from the environment.
The NAM has agreed to do so subject to the delivery of weapons and ammunition by the enemy.
The first dozens of troops began to leave the surrounding communities on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion Donbass, Simeon Semenchenko, 14 others left the Kkatla on Sunday night.
In his Facebook account, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded people are “captured by a regiment of 32 divisions of the Russian Federation and 9 tanks brigades of the Russian Federation”, where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of Russia denied reports by Ukrainian military and NATO concerning the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation: Russia will take action in the event of new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right of reply aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the imposition of new anti-Russian sanctions, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A report from the Russian Foreign Diplomatic Authority states that the European Council's “concludation” of 30 August demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their blind support to the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, on the basis of “exclusively unproved allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country”, the agency's website states.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation regrets that, contrary to the interests of its member States, Europe is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as the conditions for a full dialogue between the warring parties, emphasizing the agency.
Also on the agency's website, it is noted that there are currently no assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbasa, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has occurred, as well as a growing number of civilian casualties.
We will recall that specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation are planned for the next seven days in the European Union.
In doing so, EU representatives cooperate closely with United States officials.
It is expected that they will align the measures taken for the period of operation and the degree of severity.
New EU sanctions may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Tricky ways to save on university textbooks
Although the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who is about to move to the second year, developed a subtle way to reduce costs.
He developed a system for renting books from seniors, offering them nominal compensation to put them off selling them.
"My math study book, which is usually 180, I got on a staff for $10 and a cookie for "Chick-fill-A," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The necessary literature on the last term would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than 1,200 per year on textbooks and educational supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet shows and creative ideas like Schroeder's.
The sale of books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use it during the semester, and often costs much less than buying it.
Nibo Incorporated, owned by more than 250 university bookshops, reports that the volume of books has doubled since 2011.
Research in the industry shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookshops were rented during the last spring's semester, says Vice-President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased at university bookshops, according to the professional association of the National Association of University Stores.
Here's an introductory course on the best ways to make a good deal.
Buying in the Internet store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you'll see at a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of Math Analysis, by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hosteller, is worth about $290 on pre-scourant, but a new copy is available for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Buying a used one
If you're not against someone else's notes or damage, the textbooks used are a good option.
“Mathematic analysis” is sold for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Keseday, 25, a fourth-year-old student at Brigham Young University, says that he paid 42 cents for a copy of the book Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business of Advertising Business.
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracey, director of the College without the Wall at Massachusetts University in Emhurst, invite students to clarify from their professors whether they should not use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are not important for classes.
In such cases, older publications are often found for a very small proportion of the cost of the latter.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, which belongs to eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to the purchase of used books.
Leaking
The idea of renting textbooks should be considered if you were to treat them well enough, remember them, and do not want to keep them when the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of the new book.
For example, one student was able to hire Math Analysis on a semester for about $20.
Find out where you are taking books, including any fines you may receive for notes, notes, and injuries.
If you hire a book, remember that if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of the new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented by electronic licenseers for a certain period, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" on Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Brace says that students studying literature can often find the best prices because many classics can now be downloaded free of charge, while literature in science and engineering can be very expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Holt, 29, who is about to begin her studies at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using ISBN to find out the price of the book, since this guarantees that you are looking for the right text.
Before ordering on the Internet, says Holt, make sure you check that the book really is in the warehouse.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he had acquired was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookshop.
Putin stated the total inefficiencies of the Far East Development Fund
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, showed at a meeting on the ownership of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, says Interfax.
“15 billion rubles remain in deposits,” the President said.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested the approval of the list of pre-development Territories in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of thetors should be introduced into the State party in the fall.
The Federal Assembly, noted the President, did not approve by 1 July the list of the pre-development territories in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin has also identified key challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, increased transport accessibility to the region, removal of infrastructure constraints - both on the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create prerequisites for additional investment in the region, as well as to create pre-development areas that should become competitive with the APC key business centres, the President stressed.
It was recalled that it had previously been reported that the pre-development area could replace the EPA.
Why the Galaxy Guards were unable to save cash charges
Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget in the United States, while "The City of Sins: A Woman for Whom to Kill" returned only $12 million from his $70 million budget.
The Home Video with Cameron Diaz only brought $13.6 million on the first weekend, while children's movies like, "How do you get dragons 2 also disappointed with the proceeds.
An article by the Telegrapher Robbie Colin, a movie critic, points out that when it comes to children's films, perhaps it's a bad quality of the films themselves.
Colin called 2014 "the worst" year in history for children's movies, and he called "How to hand in dragons 2 to barely "function" with the continuation of the fantasy.
However, when it comes to films directed at audiences of a somewhat older age, the problem does not necessarily seem to be as the film itself.
In July, Wakely compared the average ratings of CinemaScor and Metacritic for every film that was rented in summer with at least 2,000 copies between May and 20 July, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of both movie viewers and movie critics, suggest that this year's production is similar in size to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be about changing spectatory habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services, such as Netflix.
The director, John Fawro, who's currently working on the fast-moving Fresneev film "The Jungle Book" said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We must recognize this and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current fall in Hollywood cash charges, Netflix's revenue from the stream reproduction service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too heavily on the comics franchise, and predicted Hollywood's crash.
In the light of the current recession, some commentators claim that his grim predictions had a share of the truth.
With several potential cash hits expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including the Bridges: Era Altrona, Minonov and Jur Park, other film industry representatives are more optimistic.
Simon Kinberg's Human X producer recently called the fall of cash charges "cyclic," said Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the most cashier in history, and no one will worry about it."
Food sanctions do not frighten the owners of the Caucasus and Middle Asian food institutions, but for European and Japanese kitchen restaurants Russian suppliers are a nightmare.
In general, the general public has so far preferred to replace the prohibited imports with products not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"Better is a small cucumber than a bad mossarella" - a Italian restaurant chef named Barlotti Mariano Valerio is destroyed about the quality of the cheeses offered him by suppliers in exchange for Italians.
Motzarella and cheese burrata ended in the restaurant first, they have a small storage period.
Parmesan supplies should last for a couple more months.
What do I do?
Going to Russia?
In 2005, I was on the Dorogomile market.
Mariano Valerio makes such an eye that it is clear that shocking memories do not release him until now.
The meat was only 30 centimeters from the floor!
There's cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant, we would never buy anything from Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's changed.
But I got a fish from the Far East for trial the other day.
That's how she got sick!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised to find that many of Italy’s usual things are for a Russian manufacturer in a wildhouse.
A few years ago, I had to buy a Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in the refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1 to 2 degrees.
It has to hang out to get soft so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with a local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get that tender meat?"
I said it's yours, you Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
The five-minute walk from Barlotti to the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" has a stop-list on the kitchen that lists missing products: French oysters, seafood.
"Brasserie Most" and "Ströck" bar, Regis Trygel, are not as pessimistic as Valerio's: the oysters from France have already been replaced by Austrians from Tunisia, and the French cheeses will be replaced by Swiss cheeses.
But Régis is getting more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The colour capusto is 200 roubles!
I say, "Why is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make a living."
But this cabbage shouldn't be worth more than 80 rubles!
Far East oysters we buy by weight, but they live for 15 or 20 years, you know how much weight their shell weighs?
At the price, it turns out it's a super-delicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of pancakes for foreign cooks.
The standard story is, "The first three months were all right, then the quality dropped dramatically."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibre and quality.
Many restaurants in the European kitchen don't know what's going to happen to them when the cheese supply is gone.

The sanctions menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of separate economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are mainly referred to as food sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and subproducts from domestic birds, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurts, foil, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrup.
Restaurants began to have a bakery with suppliers: food prices had risen, and it was urgent to look for analogies from other countries.
This will have the greatest impact on expensive restaurants with monocouples in France, Italy, Spain, to which products were delivered directly from “material” countries.
The generals had to be renovated before.
For example, in early 2014, Rosselhozzor banned the import of Australian beef and a year earlier American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers set up the supply of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer 2014 sanctions were much more serious.
On 20 August, Prime Minister Dimitri Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree that exclude Atlantic salmon and trout, non-cancer milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for planting.
The Italian, Valerio, hopes that the sanctions can be mitigated.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in an uncertain environment.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the final segment was up to 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergey Mironov, Rector, the owner of RestConsalt.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
We're the only ones with very few of these, and it can take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the Brasserie Bridge is ready to do this: 10-15% of the food will have to be abandoned, half the menu will have to be reworked.
The mixed kitchen restaurants are already beginning to replace dishes, such as marble beef steak for befstrogans, says Sergey Mironov.
“The raw materials from Europe may be replaced by Russian, Belarusian, Serbian, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, by the representative of Oxana Glibchuk, East-West.
Plums and dairy products from Europe have parallels in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the United States may be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seed from Norway - salmon, seed, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of European fruit and vegetables can be compensated by domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, it would be easier for budget online restaurants to reshape than for the premier segment: there were hardly Gourmets capable of distinguishing the Italian Mozarella from the Russian one.
Although it would be difficult for Ginza Project institutions to do so, he believes.
Ginza Project has dozens of restaurants under different brands and from their menu.
It's gonna take a lot of time to replace," says Mironov.
In Ginza, the comments were withdrawn, referring to the absence of owners in the country.
Caucasian and Central Asian Cafés emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than Europeans
But there are a lot of restaurants that will be virtually unaffected by sanctions.
These include institutions with CIS kitchens: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There is no expensive food in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatuna Kolbay, the owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe "Wai Me!".
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, and we don't use the exotic greens as the basis of many dishes."
No food has yet been removed from the menu in the institutions of Kolby.
Timura Lanski, owner of Chihona N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchens, the sanctions don't bother him either: he's only going to have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia set up imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we would even win at a price, for us it would be cheaper than imports from Europe,” he said.
Cutting, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit can be cheaper from the LPG.
However, what is imported from Central Asia is much better than what is imported from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Uzbek tomatoes are known to be delicious, sweet.
No one speaks of Spanish like that.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Justice of Uzbekistan, Olymba Artikov, stated that he planned to increase the export of productive products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Restaurants of fastfood who responded to Deneg's request also respond quite calmly to sanctions.
McDonald's Press Service stated that localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia supplier department, about 80 per cent of the products are purchased by the network in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices of meat products produced from imported raw materials.
The “Temke” had no more than 4 per cent of the “sanction products”.
They didn't touch the sanctions or the noodle Walker.
KFC, Burger King and Little Kartoska did not respond to Daneg's request, but other market participants argue that Burger King's localization is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, Rectors are willing to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East
On his humpback.
In the meantime, Rectors complain that because of increased demand, prices are rising even for local products.
“Grabley products have an average price increase of 10 to 15 per cent, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio twice,” says Rector Roman Rozhnikovski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will increase by 5 to 10 per cent, and Colbay admits.
East-West doesn't deny it, "For example, Belarusian milk products have been traveling 10-15% since early August."
"The Brazilian suppliers raised the price of pork almost twice," complains Sergey Cancer, Deputy Director-General of Stardogs.
The chickens were about 35%.
We're waiting for China's prices to cool off Brazil's hot heads.
Stardogs will soon have an 8 per cent price increase planned.
Now it's very undesirable to raise prices, says Rack.
According to the statistics, the increase in total income for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest indicator since 2010.
The difference prices will continue to rise, he admits, but is not clear how fast: while most of the reporters are stocked with products for the next two months, in the hope of waiting for the price overruns.
But what's gonna happen in two months is nobody knows.
In front of Moscow’s mayor, there are dozens of tents decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the scene, musicians play waltz.
It's a regional product festival with a funny name, "There's Time."
"We've been planning to do a local food festival for a long time, and here's the sanctions, we're in a hurry, we're organizing the festival," says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, the Greek cook Anastas prepares macaron salads and home candy, and the other day there was a master-class for preparing a boar with caramelized apples.
All Russian products assure the organizers.
In the tents is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian people's economy.
The honey from Bashkiria, the deer from Salehard, the vegetables from Lenin's Boom, cheese from the fallen Italian, Jay Clause.
"Fooding for restaurants can be replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East," says Philippe Galkin, owner of the fish store.
We've got a kidney, a cat, a boiler, a peacock, a chow, a king's salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because it's wild fish.
The Norwegian salmon is an aquaculture.
You're taking him in, he's not even moving.
And our Far East salmones will not be held in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian mosarella with a domestic one
In the shade of his tent lies shrimps with a jar of Magadan, cod, molasses, flour, coppers from Crimea, cracks from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's time to go fishing from the Far East.
According to statistics, fisheries in Russia in 2013 are over 4 million tons, and a large proportion of fish go to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
"Your People" has been in operation since 2012, selling fish through the Internet store, serving another one and a half dozen restaurants, such as Simple Things, before the sanctions were imposed.
Now there are applications from another 15 restaurants.
The same sushi can be made of our fish, it's hot.
We're frozen, we've tried different recipes.
We're selling sushi over the Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish are a few times cheaper, and our delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilo.
I'm being prepared for the Filadelphia rescue with a cat in Galkin's tent.
Unlike the rolls of the seed, these have to chew longer, but the awareness that this fish is ours, our own, is giving us strength.
There are even rolls of paltus and sea perch on the website of the "My People's" bench.
In sushi bars, it's true that Norwegian salmon is preferred to Chilean.
Galkin explains this because lavender cooks will come up with new prescriptions for distant - east fish.
"The Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," gives an explanation to the owner of Killfish Bar Dimitri Eviev.
About the same situation with other products: Russian producers could have occupied a niche that had been released, but that was not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimova project, it is now possible to talk more about importing imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and high volumes.
They can quickly replace prohibited imports with those of our farmers.
That is, the main winners of the ban will be the major producers of other countries,” Akimov says.
But last month, the restaurant industry received a more disturbing signal than food sanctions.
As a result of mass exceptional inspections, Roswannadzor was temporarily suspended by three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg.
“We are examining the nature of the claims submitted to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of restaurants for visitors”, stated Dengam in the McDonald's Press Service.
No one really knows what's going to happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be experienced, says anonymized company staff member involved in restaurant consulting.
If you start closing McDonald's all over the country, then the script will be different.
“Europrotocol” instead of “HYBD” reference
Casco payments will be available without a GIBD certificate, so the CB intends to encourage the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has drawn up draft guidelines according to which, as of 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to obtain cash-in-service payments without a GDSD certificate.
This is true only in cases where the accident was “europrotocol” without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two vehicles were involved in the accident, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the established limit, and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
Since 2 August, the “Europrotocol” payment limit is 50,000 roubles, and from 1 October it will be raised to 400,000 roubles in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad regions.
The point is that often, even with minor damage, in a situation where accidents can be treated by “europrotocol”, drivers who have been injured cause DFS.
If there was a policy of Kasco, it would not be possible to obtain compensation without a GIBD ' s certificate.
The parameters outlined in the draft directive are intended to remove this obstacle to the implementation of the Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for helmets for accidents made without HBD personnel should not be lower than the limit for “europrotocol”.
However, it cannot be higher than the limit defined in the Kasco insurance policy.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the DFS and the roads.
But she's not likely to be admired by either the motorists or the insurers.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new policy rules for the payment of helmets.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver will in most cases wait hours for an inspector to report a minor accident because it's more reliable.
And we don't know what's going to make it easier to beat the fraudsters or convince the drivers that the Europrotocol is reliable.
The savings certificate will make the name and the irrevocable
Minfin wants to ban bearer certificates, but he's going to let banks make them like an irrevocable contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill that will prohibit the bearer's savings certificates.
Recently, this tool has gained popularity because the rates are higher than the rates of bank deposits.
The fact is that the bearer ' s savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system and the bank is cheaper because they do not have to be credited to the care of the Investment Insurance Agency (ARA).
The pictoriality of the situation is that this step is planned because of the small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and will be affected by it by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to ASW estimates, control 98 per cent of the professional market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow is estimated to be about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASS, is that the customers of a small bank that bought such a certificate, if they withdraw their licences, are trying to get money from the ASS.
Some investors may assume that their investments are insured by not having sufficient financial literacy and by purchasing savings certificates from the bearer.
The justified absence of insurance payments for these certificates if the licence is withdrawn from the bank may lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.
In the practice of the agency, there have been cases in which bearers of issuing certificates have attempted to recover insurance compensation through the courts”, stated ARA.
The problem is, of course, a mind-blowing one.
There would still be no one to pay certificates to buyers, since they had no legal right to compensation from the State.
If it were true that the instrument was not insured in the AER, metal accounts in which citizens ' funds were recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and pallady - would also be prohibited.
These accounts do not fall into the deposit insurance system either, but no one has yet attempted to do so.
It is likely that the bearer certificates are a very convenient security document, which can actually act as a quasi-dengege.
However, their movement is almost beyond control: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, hand it over to any citizen, and before they are exposed, the certificate can be replaced by a large number of owners.
It is no coincidence that the bill stipulates that the savings certificate must be the very security that must be kept in the depository.
In order to send a saw to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without due payment.
I mean, there's an equivalent of an irrevocable contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, protests were held by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the centre of Newport on a march against NATO.
And on Sunday at Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff Hall for what was described as anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclau followed us through the weekend and talked to the protesters who had come from around the world, from Bridged to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will deliver weapons to Iraq to counter the terrorist group “Islamic State of” and will report on 31 August to ITAR-TASS, referring to the decision taken at the meeting of FAR Government representatives headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to be sending 30 man-portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The supplies will be delivered by the end of September.
In addition, it has been decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will deliver a government statement on the subject in the Bundestag.
So far, Germany has not delivered its weapons to hot spots.
The opinion of the FAR on the sending of weapons to Iraqis has been divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop members of the “Islamic State”, and others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Politemen hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donets militia shot up a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TAS.
It is reported that this occurred in the Gulf of Taganrog near the towns of Chiroquino and Nonamen (10-20 km east of Mariupoli).
A number of Ukrainian media report the shooting of two coast guard boats.
It is clear that the incident took place today at about 4:20 a.m.
Adolescents were taken from the Blue Mountains by helicopter
TWO Bushuokare teenagers were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man went camping shortly after noon on Sunday at Govets Lip in Blackheit.
The concerned relatives called the police about 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team was sent, including a local police and rescue unit, and a couple were found about 11 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with the couple overnight and were picked up on a swan Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition.
Two alliances met
The Minsk summit negotiations did not resolve the problems for which they had been convened but had given rise to a new format: the European Union ' s first people met with the first persons of the future of the Eurasian Union.
On a worrying note (the situation around Ukraine is not too late), EU and Customs Union leaders discussed a number of “hot issues” for the first time.
Whether such a structure can work effectively is not clear; however, it is clear who has taken off the cream from this summit.
Questions in this regard fell back on the evening of 26 August, when Belarusians, followed by other Eurasians and Europeans, saw a new President, Lukashenko, on television.
The Belarusian leader was an example of focused respectability, that was the behaviour of a man who had just broken a Jackpot and planned to grow old in a higher society.
How Maydan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to address the final briefing on their behalf is not just the legitimization of the President with 20 years of service.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged actor of European policy and as the main thinker of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Denis Melyantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as it used to be.
"That Catherine Ashton has met Aunta-Tat with Lukashenko suggests that relations with the EU will continue to be unfeeled," he said "The Fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: the preparations for a breakthrough by the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maydan in Kiev, in the summer of 2013.
“The results have also been achieved with the EU — successful negotiations on visa and readmission facilitation, modernization dialogues,” lists the Ogonka interlocutor, and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The United States has even lifted some sanctions.
As far as the Ukrainian events are concerned, they themselves and the response of the Belarusian leadership to them have only contributed to the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, was able to maintain relations with Ukraine -- warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko was able to come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Russian militias in Donbassa with all severity, did not fight with Moscow either.
Minsk has not withdrawn from either the Customs Union or the CSTO and a Russian airbase is located in Baranović.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian question - and appreciated it - the Belarusian experts are confident.
How successful the Lukashenko movement for political diversification will be will be seen from how often Minsk will soon be able to host EU+TC meetings.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expected from the relationship in the new format.
The Spokesperson, Ashton Maya Kosyančić, merely stated that the issue was not a priority in the context of war and peace.
However, it has been reported that Kazakhstan may be the next place for a meeting on the Ukrainian question, with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The small delegation to Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaev, in which he admitted that he was personally asked by the representatives of the European Union.
However, in the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties would not object to Minsk remaining the central venue for meetings, both in the Russian-OSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” will become a well-known European leader who helps to solve the global problem.
A European farmer’s best friend
The composition of the EU delegation, which included the Euro-Commissions on Trade and Energy, had already led to the conclusion that the main thrust of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbassa but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future negotiations on the supply of gas and to address the concerns of the TC countries under the Ukrainian Association Agreement with the EU is more ambitious than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Commissioner of Commerce, Karl De Gücht, nevertheless, indicated that EU representatives had “come to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that had economic consequences and not vice versa”.
It seems, however, that in the economy the crisis in Ukraine “works” on Belarus.
Its consequences - and above all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - are borne by Minsk, who is so far under the pressure of sanctions, a long-awaited field of manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Mises Research Centre, an ex-candidate to the President of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanczuk, European investors are actively interested in the capacity of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation, circumventing sanctions.
There are supply schemes for which Vladimir Putin, at the summit, pitted Minsk.
“The originators of these schemes,” said Romanchuk “Ogonka”, are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out supply patterns, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
The Russian business needs to be restored somehow, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies are willing to start production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials in addition to the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be very useful.”
In the view of Romanczuk, the role of the host of the EU and TC negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and for developing economic relations with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agrarian sector from the sanctions of Moscow were estimated at Euro5-10 billion, while the European Commission had now offered only Euro125 million in compensation to the agricultural community.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact on Eurofarmers.
This could raise Lukashenko ' s credibility in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality Without Initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk, from its active role in the birth of the TC+EC format, is revealed, and the Belarusian leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that he had initiated the new format and had become the new format of Kiev.
"It was your proposal to meet, without any incongruity to discuss, not with the Baracht Bay to take a decision, after the signing of the Treaty of Association with the EU, to investigate the situation that had been created in Ukraine at that time," he addressed the cameras to Petr Porosenko.
The observers, however, interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which reportedly was initially opposed to Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases its political power.
In the Belarusian diplomatic agency, Belarus is careful to emphasize that in organizing EU-TC interaction on its land, Belarus has no self-interesting objectives and the ultimate goal of such a format is to create a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“It is in the spirit of those concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, put forward and promoted the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation,” said Ogonka in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, an agency that has recently been scrupulously chosen.
Free entry zones may appear in Moscow
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of free-of-entry zones as a method of combating the congestion of central roads similar to other major cities in the world, and refers to the Moscow Deputy Transport Officer Maxim Likstov.
One option that has been successful is paid entry.
It's an expert opinion, we're going to study it, and we're going to look at all the negatives and benefits.
To say that some decision has been made on this matter before it's too early," Liksutov told me.
Zammera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and load to Moscow, was of great importance to the capital’s authorities.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already under way construction of a central ring road, adding Likstov.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example that does not necessarily cover all traffic through Moscow.
If there was sufficient transit infrastructure, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow,” the mayor noted.
Also, Maxim Likstov stated that the introduction of paid parking spaces had substantially unloaded the capital streets.
And according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to dwell on what they have achieved.
We will recall that on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobian, participated in a bookmark ceremony for the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CACAD).
Fatigue of Sinful One
Frank Miller and Robert Rodrigues film "The City of Sins: A Woman for Whom to Kill" did not revolutionize the revolution he was expected to take.
The first City of Sin (2005), filmed with minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized between films, comics and literary Nuar.
Sikwell is also revolutionary in his own way: in the sense that he destroys the fundamental line of thinking today's "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if we mean by the the thesis of the universe, and the antithesis - the cosmos of comics).
It should now read "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
"The City of Sins 2" is chaotic at both the playwright and the philosophical levels: it's both chaotic in the bad sense of words.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first City, although Marv (Mickey Rourk), remember, finished his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing can ever be taken away - as this popular wife - from the air of the knives and other ax with favours.
But the old men are literally pushed by the elbows of the newcomers, like they broke into a city from some other movie, about the meaning and story of which the viewers are asked not to worry.
So his story, shamelessly torn by the authors in the most interesting place, is that of Johnny's superb player, Joseph Gordon-Livette.
He's got a hot-fried Eva Lord and a vengeful Dwight.
But this confusion, in which Dwight, let's say, does not distinguish between Johnnie's face - especially since, like other parts of the body, the characters are carried out with an inexorable regularity - is not a disaster or even a half victory.
It's not people, but we realize they're the archetypes of the Nuara: a rock bitch, too confident of himself, a player who's good at a sex media trap by a detective, a corrupt hoop-sensor.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and the archetype chases, it's no longer a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And it's funny to ask abstract painting questions about logic.
Besides, even in this crazy world, there is something permanent.
Warlords from the first "Cities" continue to defend themselves in a circular manner against the shadow of their native slums.
And Detective Hartigan's ghost is not-no, and he'll look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem of "The City of Sins 2" is another.
Frank Miller was good at putting comics and nuar together as a painter, and as a director, he flipped the idea of how to put comics on the screen.
Comicx and Nuar are two aggressively opposite "realities."
The comic book phenomenon was born in the late 1920s, but when the novels of Dashil Hammet’s Blood Grench (1929), the Maltese Falcon (1930) and the Glass Key (1931) created the canon of Nuara, then known as hard-boiled school, created.
Or pop fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood dozens of heroes, from a pophai sailor, a spinach eater, giving him the wealth of power, Superman, Batman, and Spice Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "vengefuls".
But in any comic book movie, there was something harmful: the figures were persistent in their desire to grow a screen-based flesh, and they were nothing but fads in their unwitting "real" world.
Simply put, they were purely deprived of "exclusive."
Noar, on the other hand, is the most exotic genre of the world's literature.
After the wars of the world, the traditional novel — with experiences, personalities, family scandals and historical background — lost all credibility.
What kind of Forsites, what Tibo and Rugon-Macarra, what are even the Bologna and Rostov thinking after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
The novel was peacefully mutated in soap opera, and the criminal - by definition marginal - the novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett found out what it's like to work as a health worker on the front.
He was a communist.
Like, by the way, there were at least close to the company and the pillar of the genre, such as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors of Jules Dassen, Joseph Lauzi, Edward Dmitrick.
Therefore, the Nuar, whose archetype they named, first, is rude and cynical, and second, is purely social.
That's almost an American version of socialism.
The first City of Sins was observed in that it was unnatural but organically connected the comic book to the Nuar.
For the first time, the comic book was relived, not being ashamed of its graphic nature, but pretending to be a real movie.
The darkness of the selling world, where the cardinal ordered the murder and the senator covered a terrible sadist son, was quite worthy of Per Hammett.
And the painted details of a kind of cut-off head, which the sadist used to decorate his nest, the pen of the genius James Elroy, the author of the Black Orchid and the best -- that is, the declarative thinner -- the neonarian.
The City of Sins 2 is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller's radical style-- Rodrigues before the comic book tradition.
Probably a lot of this happened because of 3D technology.
When you watch the second "Grand of Sins", you feel like you're trapped in a glass ball inside which the snow goes into a toy bed.
But most of the time, it's not snow, it's bloody marks, but what difference does it make?
And there's nothing to be said about socialism.
Because it's only possible when there's a girl somewhere, someplace around us, but there's a normal world, where you can bring back a girl who's down the curve or you can say to the distraught parents that her killer is being punished.
But when there is no place in the city except sin, then sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
I'm bored, like any other rule.
The City of Sins 2 chaos is boring.
Justice for the sake of domestic corruption gave this little but small gloven of freshness to this man.
Titles warn that the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to maturity, in the most vegetarian episode of which a person's fingers are broken, it gives hell's humor.
Hammet would love it.
The socialists of France have to "stop and put France in order," says the key ally of Frasua Holland.
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left-wing forces to “exercise a warm attitude” towards the socialist President who was under attack, whose movement had not been approved by the overwhelming majority of the French.
The President deserves the respect of everyone, deserves our loyalty, and deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay close to him," he said, making applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured that his Government would not question the disputed 35-hour workweek in France, despite the inflammatory proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Makron, the new Minister of Economy earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobira, Minister of Justice, put his sticks in his wheels, came to a meeting of dissenting members of Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticized the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost their faith in the future”.
Marin Le Pe, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, expressed contempt for permanent internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not imagine that the new Wall's Government would last for months.
François Holland is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to gather a new government when the summer did not last.
"And the new one won't hold on in the fall or winter," Mrs. Le Pen told the reporters.
It reiterated its party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that it was confident that the party could easily win the early elections and was ready to run.
The ruling party of France experienced a breakdown in the March municipal elections, and the extreme right national front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey of Sunday's Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of French people believed that the Socialist Party was at risk of falling into several competing factions before the end of Mr. Alland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at Xians Po University, warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to feel that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"A city without drugs" has no claim.
The Sverdlov arbitration court left the Regional Ministry of Public Administration's decision-making authority to the Drug Free City Foundation without consideration.
The Office intended to recover more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rent charges for the building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the Court of Arbitration of the Sverdlovsk Region has left the Executive Directorate of the Department of Public Property Management of the Region (MIGSO) without consideration of the City Without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders is the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugenius Royzman).
The regional authorities intended to recover 7.3 million roubles from the organization as rent charges.
It is now known that the plaintiff did not appear twice before the court, which led to the decision to refuse the proceedings.
The reason for the absence of representatives from the ICGESO administration was not clear, and the Chief of Legal Affairs, Maxim Titov, did not respond to the phone calls.
The Fund was also unable to contact representatives.
We will recall that this is the mansion, which has occupied a foundation in the centre of the city on the street of Belinsk, 19 on a grant basis since 2011.
That decision was taken by the ex-governor, Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the executive direction of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Sverdlov region filed a claim with the Sverdlov arbitration court for the removal of the fund from the building.
According to the claim, the agency required the court to declare the grant contract to be non-convictionable as the premises of the monument.
In the view of the ICGESO administration, the agreement did not record substantial terms for the lease of the cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlov arbitral tribunal dismissed the claim and an appeal was filed with the 17th Permi arbitral tribunal, which was granted.
The fund then filed an appeal against this decision with the same court, which was not granted, and the decision was appealed by the fund to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court accepted the management.
A new lease contract was concluded in 2013, under which the fund began to pay rent again, as described by Eugenius Royzman, the head of the city.
Rental fees were awarded to 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous district administration has given us this building for free, recognizing our drug-control merits, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration decided differently," he stated.
Tatyana Droyaev, Ekaterinburg
Why Mayor Ekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, Monsignor Ekaterinburg’s unirosse deputy, Alexander Kosinitz, invited the mayor of the city’s Speaker, Evgeny Royzman, to resign.
A criminal case was brought against the arrested person on suspicion of the murder of the retired deputy of Gorpez Kineva, who was considered a partner of the mayor.
How Evgenia Royzman Found a Criminal Case
On 1 July, it was reported that criminal proceedings had been instituted against the “celevette” (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) on the blog of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Royzman.
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlov region, where Anna Filatova, Director of the Legal Centre for Defence, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Royzman accused her of writing on her blog that she was involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her ex-wife.
The mayor of Ekaterinburg is convinced that "this is a regular attempt to avenge the truth."
The iPhone's gonna turn into a purse.
In the lead-up to 9 September, when Apple has to present his new developments, there are more and more leaks in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
Referring to sources, the American media report that the sixth generation of the iPhone will be equipped with a mobile purse function as a result of the joint Apple project and the Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Blogberg and the dedicated Internet resource Re/code, on 9 September Apple can, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, which will make the cell phone function available in the new smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this matter.
This function allows payment to be made at the store's cash register by means of a smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user by means of the Touch ID function.
It is reported that NFC technology will be introduced into the iPhone for the first time, which allows for a non-continuous payment by means of a smartphone and a corresponding reading device on the cash register.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Simiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC function was presented in 2004 as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Simiconductors and more than a hundred other companies in the so-called NFC Forum, the Association for the Advancement of Technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with the function NFC - Samsung Nexus S was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google presented a Google Wallet system that allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with an Android smartphone.
However, American experts stress that despite the large investment of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, U.S. Ritlers are still cautious of innovation and are not too willing to spend money on their stores ' equipment with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's entry into the market will make the Ritzlers accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their trading places.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France: The position of Paris regarding the supply of Mistralley to Russia does not change
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs official Romen Nadal stated that Paris had maintained its position on the delivery of the Mistral type of helicopter to Russia.
“I can recall a statement by the President of the Republic (François Holland) in his interview with Le Monde of 20 August: “Today the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is a decision of the Europeans, not of France," quotes Mr. Nadal `RIA Newska'.
Thus the representative of the French foreign policy department responded to the question as to whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in the position of Paris in the performance of the contract

The Ukrainian National Security Council: Seven soldiers were killed in the past 24 hours in the area of military operations
The representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, Andrei Liesenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the fighting zone in the east of the country during the previous 24-hour period, while 25 had been injured.
The situation in Ilowaysk is extremely difficult.
Until the withdrawal operation is completed, details will not be disclosed.
Upon completion of the operation, loss data and the reasons for the situation will be made public.
The perpetrators of such a situation will be held accountable,” added Mr. Lisenko, refusing to discuss the situation in greater detail in Ilowaysk, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded.
According to the representative of the SNBS, “every effort is being made to return the soldiers who have been captured”, reports ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Liesenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had withdrawn from Luganska airport in the direction of Georgia.

Norwegian Cruise approaching $3 billion in Preside Cruises
The Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the end of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide the Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, with access to cruise ships of class "lux" and secured customers of Preside Cruises because it competes with the larger competitions of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, sources reported on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Preside Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of the Norwegian Cruise.
Sources asked to remain unnamed, as the negotiations were not open.
The representatives of the Norwegian Cruise and Preside Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, manages 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent higher than in 2012.
Preside Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She reported income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than one year earlier.
The 29 billion-dollar cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of the middle class in developing economies, such as China and India, in the coming years.
Companies are trying to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulatory authorities for the primary public placement of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after $850 million in 2007.
The Norwegian Cruise was created in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator belonging to Ghentting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino controlled by the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in the Northern Cruise in 2008.
The Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a share of 28 per cent, Apollo owned a share of 20 per cent, and TPG Capital LP owned a share of 8 per cent in the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of North American cruise passenger flows, according to registration documents, at the first public publication of Prestege Cruises.
Crimea may receive 250 million roubles of subsidies
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposes to allocate 250 million roubles in 2014 to the State radio station Crimea.
As shown in the draft Mincompassion Regulation, which is posted on a single information portal on the preparation of regulations, subsidies are intended to be spent “to cover the costs of creating conditions for wide-ranging information about the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also be used for the purchase of equipment, roof repairs and power systems in the radio transmission building based in 1959, reports RIA News.
The Hong Kong Democratic Movement has been thwarting the statement of the Chinese representative the day after the election decision was taken
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress established on Sunday a procedure whereby only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the election of the head of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of the majority of the members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Pekinists.
The decision made it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the ballot paper and forced the democratic activists to renew their promise to stop the Hong Kong financial centre with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform was the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders feared that the call for democracy would be extended to other cities.
Following the publication of the Beijing document describing China ' s control over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city ' s business centre and held a sit-in strike.
The briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China People ' s Congress, Jang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Bureau of the State Council, Feng Wei, were also to address a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students stated that they would meet at the head of Government of Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 hectares of land owned by Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced their intention to join 400 hectares of land on the West Bank of the Jordan River belonging to Palestinian autonomy.
According to BBC, the decision to join South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to pay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli youths in June of this year.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence announced the occupation of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish an administrative office on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saiba Arikata, the world public should call Israel to account for “the ongoing settlement activity on the West Bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin requires Kiev to begin negotiations on the “Statehood” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “Statehood” of the separated region.
His Spokesperson, Dimitri Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the Eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine must be reviewed to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin ' s appeal to the Kiev Government to begin negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equal to the obvious strategy that it should have since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help separatists take over the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly declared territory of Novorossia de facto independence in order to draw closer to Russia, not to the West.
In an interview with the State First Channel of Television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of the separatist-held territory in eastern Donetsk and Lugana regions, which had been captured in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula to Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists recently named the seized territories of Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace negotiations would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians began campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces attacked peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, the “Illussic plenary”, reported ITAR-TASS.
“We must start meaningful negotiations immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of the society and the State status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said that Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the East regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, “because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict”.
The intervention of the Kremlin press secretary to correct the “untrue interpretation” of Putin's words underlined the decision of the Russian leadership to act against the separatist rebellion in the east in a different way than the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugan region of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million non-Russian residents and the pre-conflict polls showed widespread support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats had discussed in international forums would empower regional Governments in Ukraine to determine trade agreements and foreign policy, in fact, by giving the Kremlin factual control over the territory that would connect the main territory of Russia to Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, which was joined five months ago, lies the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical marine resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and casting plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
The Ukrainian President, Peter Poroshenko, proposed during his inauguration speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, weigh the amendments to the Constitution to give more control over their finances and language status to the isolated regions.
His view of autonomy, however, appears to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arming and incitement are accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to agree with separatist leaders, as equal, followed the new rebel offensive last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from before the peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took control of the city of Novoazowsk in an attack, about which Ukrainian security officials say they fear it is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory until Crimea.
This has led to extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupoli, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between the Novoaz and the narrow passage to the Crimea peninsula.
On Saturday, Powderko appealed to the European Union leaders meeting in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of no return," warned Powderenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU Summit has not taken certain measures; leaders have called for the drafting of more severe sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaysk after two convoys of Russian armoured personnel and 1,000 military personnel entered the Donetsk region last week to support separatists in difficulty, Colonel Andriy Lisenko, the spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly detained in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airliners captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago and reported to Lisenko on Sunday.
The naked scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his aversion to hackers who may have stolen naked photos of his bride, Gabi Greco, and an entire list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was outraged when a number of frank photographs depicting the naked Jennifer Lawrence came onto the Internet as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with famous people.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have about 60 frank photographs of the Star of the Hunger Games, Lawrence and Superstars, including Kate Appton and Kara Delevin, Ryan Grande, Ariana Grande and Lia Michel and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strakhowski and residing in Melbourne also allegedly stole photographs from the iCloud leak.
On the list 101, the name of the famous.
Edelsten, who made a proposal last month to Greco, said, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was "shameful" and that the people she was directed to "feel they were invaded."
The hacker is expected to have 30 photographs of Palmer with a former boyfriend, Scott Spidman, including two images of her lying in the naked pool.
Palmer's work in the film includes Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of "Chac" Strahoski and the actress of "Prohibited Reception" Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen photos.
The representative of Lawrence said TMZ, "This is a sudden invasion of privacy."
Acter Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker by Twittering "To put out photos stolen from the mobile phone is, in fact, no different from the sale of stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, you can't tolerate publishing stolen photos.
Potential method of theft of photographs of naked celebrityes discovered
The mass hacking of star accounts may be due to vulnerability in Annex Find My Phone.
The next Web resource was described by a potential scenario.
A Python script was published on the Gitub resource, which allows you to pick up passwords for the Find My Phoner service of Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
The same combination of logic and Apple ID password is used to access it as the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photographs of famous photographs were stolen.
The script allows you to recognize a password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces various combinations of symbols, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the Find My Phone service provided no password input.
When the security system is properly organized, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and the user must be informed of the hacking attempt.
Because of vulnerability, users have not received any reports of an attempt to obtain a password for their account.
The hackers recognized the password from Apple ID and used it to access iClaude.
According to Hackapp's Twitter user, vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripting program was written to select passwords.
The vulnerability is currently closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user of Hackapp and noted that the above vulnerability was common to many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability had been used to access the “star” account.
It's not me, plz RT.
The Prime Minister has re-enacted foreign records on Twitter
Although there is no solid evidence that vulnerability in Find My Phone has been used to steal photographs, there has been a wave of harmful acts using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded ransoms from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, the safety of the clouds was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
Russia has also previously been hit by the Twitter of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev.
If the perpetrators have access to iCloud as described above, the password of the head of government account in microblogging may also be stored there.
The Next Web resource could not obtain Apple's comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-conqueror
President Vladimir Putin of Russia gave Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anna Burak.
The relevant decree is published on the Internet legal portal.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia to a permanent residence and asked the Federation of the Modern Five Camps to give her the opportunity to speak in favour of the congregated Russian Federation.
In 2013, she won two phases of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European championship in personal life, and became the world champion in a mixed-staphet, which is one of the new types of sport.
It maintains leadership positions during the current season.
According to the rules, she would have to obtain special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee in order to attend the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Anna Burak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her nationality.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to Shakhmatist Ekaterina Laggen, a native of Lviv, who is a two-time champion of Europe (2005, 2008), a world on the face (2010) and a rapid chess game (2014).
On behalf of the Ukrainian women ' s team, the athlete was the winner of the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the command championship of peace in Astana (2013) and the command championship of Europe in Warsaw (2013).
SCR dropped its investigation into the disaster of Tu 204 in Vnoukovo
The Russian Investigative Committee (RCC) has terminated its criminal investigation of the accident of the Red Wings aircraft Tu 204.
This is reported by the agency's press service.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and the aircraft engineer.
The forensic examination revealed that the accident was caused by increased landing rates, non-compliance by the crew with standard landing procedures, and the unintentional departure of engines to higher direct-travel speeds.
The Red Wings flight to Prague Moscow took off on 29 December 2012 when it landed at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.
The airship flew over the runway and was set on fire.
At the scene, an aircraft commander, a second pilot and a flight engineer were killed.
Two flight attendants were taken to hospital facilities, where they subsequently died of injuries.
Three more flight attendants who had been hospitalized with severe injuries had been treated for a long time.
In addition, the driver of a car moving on the Kiev highway at the time of the disaster was seriously injured.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The Transport Prosecutor's Office, after the disaster, conducted a test in Red Wings, which revealed numerous violations.
The airline licence was suspended in February 2013.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelyanenko started training in SIZO
The well-known Russian mixed-style fighter, Alexander Emelianenko, aged 33, who is in SIZO on charges of sexual violence against a domestic worker, has fully recovered from injuries and has begun training.
This is reported by the Championship.
In May of this year, the Russian Investigative Committee charged Alexandra Emelyanko with rape.
The suspect was wanted, detained in Tambowa on 9 May following a traffic accident that resulted in his thigh fracture.
Emelyanko, Jr., was arrested until 31 August, and a sentence was imposed on 1 September.
However, the court was postponed and the investigation insisted on extending the period of detention until 30 September.
If the athlete's guilt was proved, he would be sentenced to up to six years' imprisonment.
What's the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelyanenko's career.
Emellanco spent his last match in January this year, losing his technical know-how to my compatriotdant, Dimitri Sosnowski.
Alexander is the youngest brother of a more famous fighter named Fedor Emelianenko.
The latter is the four-time world champion of mixed martial arts, the four-time world championship and the seven-time Russian battle samba champion.
Anger has proved to be the most universal and functional human emotion
The facial expressions are biologically universal for mankind, and each organ and group of muscles involved is not accidental but an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers from Australia and the United States have clarified.
They described their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavore, which can be briefly read in a press release issued by the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - moved and lowered down by the eyebrows, drawn into a thin line of lips, crushed nostrils - is the same in all cultures and is made by even blind children who have never seen it, notes the lead author of the study, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion had emerged to deal effectively with disputes during the conflict.
The more physical harm one person can cause to another, the more ability he has to dictate his circumstances, and the more he is able to communicate it to the householder by means of anger.
Researchers have also found support for another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to become angry and to move to action, feel that they are entitled to impose conditions that are not suitable for them, and prefer to use force to resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner.
In view of the fact that anger is primarily “the emotion of the tender”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create the angry expression of the face should make the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor, thereby making him accept his conditions as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, researchers simulated and showed each of the seven elements of an angry person on a computer.
While the lost eyebrows or forward-looking chins did not separately make a person wicked, the physical participants who were represented with such characteristics recognized the strength of the study as unanimous.
Man’s anger, like that of animals, poses a threat: an exaggerated display of his own strength, forcing him to accept and obey.
A man crushes his nostrils and puts on lips for the same purpose as a pup or a baboon that shows its pebbles.
“Gneve “starts” by refusing to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that best demonstrates the consequences of the refusal.
But the most amazing thing is that none of the components of an angry person are arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” noted Anthropologist John Tuby.
Mincomms proposed to allocate 250 million Crim to the radio station.
Mincombs proposed to allocate 250 million roubles from the federal budget to the autonomous non-profit organization “Crim” in 2014.
This is referred to in a draft Government Regulation prepared by an agency that has studied Lenta.ru.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget would be directed “to cover the costs of providing extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is planned to convert the hardware studio unit, video walls, central hardware and video server.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite sender is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fibre-optic link (VOLS) and the renovation of the energy system.
Grants will be provided within the framework of the federal budget provided for the Mincompassion.
The State Broadcasting Company “Krim” was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, over 75 per cent of the peninsula area is covered by television.
In 2011, the Crimea Television Company obtained a digital television licence.
