The white pawn on f3, the black pawn on e6, the white pawn on g4, the black pod on h4 -- Matt!
White: a1 foot to b6, c8. Black: foot to a7 and b7, king to a8, elephant to b8. White puts the rival in the position of the zigzwang, setting the hand to a6, then blacks only have two options: take the hand to a6 or move the elephant to any other field of the b8-h2 diagonal. In the first case, the whites move the pawn from b6 to b7 and set the mat. In the second case, the black man takes the black foot to a7 with the same result.
