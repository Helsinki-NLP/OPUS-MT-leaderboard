No need to demonize the people of Khabarovski.
Vrio of the Head of the Khabarov Province told of his visit to the region in an exclusive interview with Komsomol the Truth.
The Interim Acting Governor of Khabarovsk province, Mikhail Degtyrev, called upon Alexander Gámova, in an interview with the Comsomol Truth examiner, not to demolish the bribers against the background of the rallys in support of the arrested ex-head of the region of Sergei Furgal.
I want to address all political commentators, political scientists, participants of all kinds.
You don't have to demolish the people of Khabarowska.
There are hard-working and wonderful people living here, ” said Michael Degtyrev.
In an interview, Degtav recalled that he was a member of the LDDP and a one-party Furgal and added that he wished him good luck in court, and that the party and Vladimir Girinowski would be supportive of the court.
The full text of the interview is available on the KP.ru website.

Two Mexican states were alarmed by Hurricane Hanna.
The Mexican National Civil Defence Office has declared an orange (high) level of alarm in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León due to the approaching hurricane Hanna, reports TASS.
The hurricane will bring heavy rains to Mexico, and in some areas it predicts a fall of between 150 and 250 litres of rainfall per square metre.
The authorities have prepared some 800 shelters for the population.
The people will be helped by 10,000 people, including rescue workers, Nazigwards and the military.
So far, the hurricane has reached the coast of the American state of Texas at a wind speed of 150 km/h.
The arrival of Hanna in Mexico is expected on Sunday morning.
Semilarski v. Public Prosecutor ' s Office: Cassation of former Vice-Mier Tarto will be considered on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided upon early in September.
The courts of the first two courts refused to hear the case of Semilarski, but as of April, his appeal was filed by the State Court of Cassation.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant, since its authorization was outside the competence of the Administrative Court.
The Court ' s ruling stated that the complaint required compensation for damage caused in criminal proceedings.
“The Public Prosecutor's Office and the District Court must regulate such matters”, explained earlier to the correspondent, ERR, by Anette Cratesmann, Spokesperson of the Courts of Tarto.
She said that Walvo Semilarski had appealed the decision to the District Court, which on 5 February had not changed the decision of the Court of First Instance.
Now I must say my word to the State.
According to counsel for Semilarski, a jury lawyer for Oliver Nees, his client was unduly suspected of bribery for about two years.
It now requires the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to refute the wrong allegations and to compensate him for the moral damage he has suffered.
The reason for the complaint to the court was the statements made by the Special Prosecutor of the Liuna District Prosecutor, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another Vice-Maurta Artem Sovorov, was arrested on suspicion of having committed several crimes at the time.
“Let us recall that when I was arrested, the Security Police and the Public Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tarto, one of the most influential local self-governments, were corrupt.
These public suspicions in the air accompanied me for about two years.
Now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the Public Prosecutor's Office does not want to say anything about it," commented Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Neyes, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the Public Prosecutor ' s Office should operate at a press conference.
"Affirmation of bribes and corruption has proved to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, State representatives should be careful in the choice of words, so that suspects are not represented as criminals prior to sentencing.
The Public Prosecutor's Office also imposes a presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” said Nees.
“The public perception of Semilarski as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still clarified is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair treatment of the complainant,” added counsel.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former Vice-Macquer Tarto Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted for bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, a former official is charged with a deliberate violation of anti-corruption law in a particularly large transaction.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tarto participated more than thirty times in the municipal administration meetings in the decision-making process involving companies operating in Tart, whose owners or leaders Semilarski had been actively associated at the personal level during the period of time.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, so he had to be suspended from taking decisions.
Previously, as rus.err.ee wrote, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had charged Semilarski with receiving bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation in carrying out transactions on a particularly large scale.
This occurred in October 2016, when he was detained along with another Deputy Mayor, Artem Sovorov (Central Party).
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police then stated that there was strong evidence against the two Vice Mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
The Suvorov case later reached a court that fully justified politics.
The trial in the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.

How the CB ' s decision to lower the key rate will affect the economy
The bank of Russia is expected to reduce the key rate again.
It has fallen by a further 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25 per cent of the annual minimum formally another historical minimum.
The regulator looks at economic prospects more optimistic than before, according to the return of the short-term reduction of the rate, as well as the tone of the CB statements and the updated Russian economic projections.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy mitigation can soon come to a halt.
“We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, particularly given that there are still risks of inflation falling from 4 per cent down in 2021”, reported the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvir Nabillin.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a decline in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabilina, will take more than a year and a half.
It noted, however, that since the end of the pandemic, economic processes had reactivated: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand, construction and production of consumer goods had been restored, and annual declines in transport traffic and production had slowed.
According to an updated CB forecast, in 2020 the economic decline would be 4.5 to 5.5 per cent (4 to 6 per cent) and the recovery growth in 2021 would be 3.5 to 4.5 per cent, and in 2022 it would be 2.5 to 3.5 per cent.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the annual oil price forecast to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The CB used to expect $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the forecast by the Bank of Russia for inflation for 2020 was 3.7 to 4.2 per cent, compared with the previously expected 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The view of the Bank of Russia on the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which draws us closer to the end of the cycle of mitigation, and economists for Russia and the CIS, the Renaissance Capital, Sofia Donts and Andrei Melaschenko.
For example, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate for more than a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
At the last meeting, in June, the CB reduced it by one percentage point, due to low inflation rates due to reduced demand and the need to stimulate the slowing down of the pandemic and its associated constraints.
The prospects for monetary adjustment remain (at the next meeting, on 18 September, until the end of the year), but the limit is near, and Rosbank's chief analyst, Evgenius Cochelev, agrees.
The aggregate of inflation risks also indicated the proximity of the delay in mitigating interest policies - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to prevention measures and faster (compared to expectations) recovery of demand, he said.
In order to complete the follow-up by the Bank of Russia, more attention will be required to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased in the context of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
In any event, lowering the key rate will further lower the rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, perhaps, the mortgage, says Max Petrnevic, a senior economist at the Discovery Bank's Office.
The adjustment of the rates would be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarified.

Survey: The ruling Union of peasants and Greens of Lithuania once again led the party ratings
The Union of peasants and Greens of Lithuania, the leader of the Seimas Coalition, led the party ratings.
This was illustrated by a survey conducted by the Vilmorus sociological research company during the ordering of the newspaper Letuvos ritas.
Following the victory in the 2016 parliamentary elections, the peasants lost their first place and for a long time led the main critics of Russia in Lithuania, the oppositionist Fatherhood Union - Christian Democracies (Conservatives).
However, recently, President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania, while assessing the electoral capabilities of the parties, stated that the Union of peasants and Greens, after the parliamentary elections this year, was likely to be able to form a coalition again.
This statement caused conservatives to resent.
The latest survey showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 per cent of voters would vote for peasants and 17.2 per cent for conservatives.
According to the director of Vilmorus Vladas Hadis, the gap was within the limits of error, but the rulers were no longer behind the conservatives.
According to Hadys, the sociological success of the peasants had contributed to the news that their electoral list would be headed by Prime Minister Sauls Squares.
This politician was the first on the list of peasants and in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, which is now ready to vote 7.1 per cent of respondents.
For a month she suddenly lost 2%.
The fourth is the Labour Party, headed by a businessman of Russian origin by Victor Uspasski (6.2 per cent).
The remaining political organizations, according to the survey, will not be able to overcome the 5 per cent electoral barrier.

Amendments are made by the Government to the Law on Procurement of Goods, Works and Services of Certain Legal Persons.
The bill has been drafted in response to the road map for the implementation of the Strategy for Small and Medium Enterprise Development in the Russian Federation up to 2030 approved by the Government.

“Acquisition of the document will exclude arbitrary contracting of the composition and content of applications by small and medium-sized business participants”, states the Explanatory Note.

At the meeting, the head of the region commissioned all mayors to be actively involved in the development of human settlements genetics.
This is one of the main conditions for integrated district development.
All human settlements must have defined borders and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the Territory, for the construction of socially significant sites, and for infrastructure and cultural heritage, as emphasized by the head of the region.
The discussion also raised a problem with a 30 per cent reduction in the intake of milk from cooperatives.

The authorities of Podmoskovia told of the fate of the closed dumps
In Podmoskovia, solid waste sites continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being upgraded to modern waste management systems.
But this option is not possible for each site, many of which have grown into a dense housing structure.
Once the field is closed, it stands for reclamation - the body of the field is filled with soil, and the systems for degassing and decommissioning are installed.
This allows chemical processes to stop inside the landfill, so that it does not become heated, ferocious, poisoned soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump will be raised up by a useless pile in the midst of its built-up dwelling.
Why don't you make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the re-establishment of the Annino site was literally completed the other day, the authorities are considering making a pile of ski slopes.
The site, operated from 1976 to 2016, expanded to include land allocated to it.
Therefore, the reclamation involved the purchase of neighboring sites that were de facto piled up with garbage.
"Sometime it's going to pass, the field's going to "sit", and we're going to think we can make it work.
It's a ski resort, right in the eye," told the head of the Russ district of Nicolai Parthenov.
Two sites will be renewable energy production sites
The Torbejevo Polygons in Lubertsa and Timymohovo in the Bogo District will be sites for the extraction of renewable sources of energy from landfill and biological gases.
Torbeeva will launch a gas-fired power plant by the end of the year, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year and an estimated 0.95 gigacalories of thermal power, which will provide its own needs - the heating of administrative and production facilities.
Timhoho will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste-processing complex.
A museum could be set up at the Kucino Balashin area, which was closed after the residents' complaints on the line between the President and the President.
“It was an idea to create a museum for the re-establishment of Podmoskovya sites”, reported the government's vice-presidents, the Minister of Environment and Environmental Management of the District of Dimitri Kurakin.
Israel reported a drone crash in southern Lebanon
An unmanned Israeli army aircraft fell in southern Lebanon.

According to Degtav, the Khabarovski region cannot be left without a leader, so by decree of President Vladimir Putin, he was appointed to the post of head of the region, so that “a remarkable building (the government of the province) functioned, all worked, and the budget was spent on social needs”.
Vrio explained that he had not gone out to protesters before because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
So he broadcasts on social media and reads all the comments.
Two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk on 25 July.
As of 11 July, meetings in support of the former Governor have been held in the region.
On the eve of another action, Mikhail Degtav said he would leave town on the day of the rally.
It was stopped by the protestors and called for a statement on the fate of the arrested ex-governor Furgal.

The beautiful high minerals only adorned Aya Sofia
Once again about Aya Sofia, the text of Vladimir Zelinski came up, which, please, must be protested.
First of all, there's a free entry--hurrah!
I wasn't in Istanbul, but God's house is better off free than paid.
Secondly, Muslims have won this land just as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volgo-Ocean interstate, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans won America.
We're all gonna get everyone back?
Do you think there will be no Gentiles who will need to return their cape, whose place is the Decapolis Church?
Thirdly, the Muslim people have improved the building, invested in it.
I mean, it's just like the factories and estates that the Lenese took away from the bourges, they belong to the Leninians - Putin and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything from Kremlin to Angar, so it's their right to progress.
The beautiful high minerals were very beautiful to Aya Sofia, very beautiful.
There was a stupid ink, a stupid ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “Islamic” and “Islamic” civilizations.
And there are believers, and there are hypocrites.
The believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
It's the thinking of a British Mida Toynbee official who believes it's a shame to think so.
And as for him who believes every place of prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray except where he is asked to go, and goes to another place, and prays therein.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're knuckles, not hum-cocks.

A Rwandan man admitted that he had set fire to the cathedral in Nanta
A Rwandan who worked in the St. Peter’s and Paul’s Cathedral in the French city of Nant voluntarily confessed to his burning a week after the fire.
That's what France-3 reported on Sunday.
According to him, the man who had already been detained on 19 July, the day after the fire, was again detained the day before.
On Saturday evening, he appeared before the investigating judge.
Following charges of intentional damage to property, the man admitted that he had set fire to three places, under a large organ, under a small organ and in an electric shield.
He now faces up to 10 years of imprisonment and 150,000 euros of fine.
Motivation for action by a 39-year-old Rwandan has not yet been reported.
It is only known that he voluntarily assisted the congregation and that on the day of the fire, his doors were to be closed.
However, according to the camera records, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about the fire in the building.
The burning of the St. Peter and Paul in the congregation took place on July 18.
More than 200 firemen fought for several hours to commemorate the Gothic architecture.
Nevertheless, they failed to save Louis XII’s time and a unique organ of the Baroque era.
It was only three hours after the fire started that the situation was brought under control.
No one was injured as a result of the incident.
The present fire was not the first time the temple existed.
In 1972, fire destroyed his roof.
It took 13 years to deal with the consequences of that burning.
It was not until 1985 that the cathedral was opened again.
