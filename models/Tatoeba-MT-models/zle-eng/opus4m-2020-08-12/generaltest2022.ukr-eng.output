In Kherson, the people went back to the rally, and the Russians didn't get out.
As reported by the Western agencies, the Germans were able to hold a rally before they arrived at the site for the decommissioning of the military raf and the equipment.
"We've had a meeting, we've got a ref technique coming in," said one of the Westerners.
In the past, the citymen had traditionally gathered to protest in Liberty Square -- near the DDA building and the semblance.
This area, like the building, is currently controlled by the armed Russian forces, which use weapons against rallyers and are kidnapping people.
On April 3, armed Russian occupiers reportedly used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakovka.

Zelenski: Mariopol, the heart of war, will stop fighting; we will have weak positions.
President Vladimir of Zelenski believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariopol will determine the course of the war – and if the FDA is defeated there, the Russians can leave the talks and reoccupy the occupied territories.
Direct language: "Mariopol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It's fighting, we're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They are the people who have taken a large number of enemies away.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the EPA, and if they're stronger, the negotiating table will be closer for us and we'll have some advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all of these directions, we can wait until we meet.
Because then Russia will take all of these steps that could lead to a return even to the cities that we've been deoccuping right now.
They can do the same.
Then our negotiating situation will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting to the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find it.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory..."
The Green also said it's difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose opportunity for diplomatic solutions if we have them."
Direct language is, "People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think they're going to be satisfied with any peace under any circumstances.
But if we are not speaking emotionally, war must end in peace or end in millions of victims.
And even where there's a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight – but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for the dust when nothing's gone, no people."

Because of the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality.
It's the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
English poetic metaphor in modern literature makes it possible to come up with an analysis of the post- up-to-date context as a kind of metaphor that plays the role of the axiological criterion.

The Directorate-General of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence published a list of Russian military personnel who participated in war crimes in Bucha of Kiev.
According to Uchrinform, this is what the Department of Defense General Intelligence has to say on Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 individual MoUs who are directly involved in war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Buča,” the report refers to.
The MoU notes that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and brought to justice.
You can browse the list by reference.
As reported by Uchrinform, Irvny, Bouch, Gostomel, and the whole of Kiev were released from Russian invaders.
The liberated towns and villages have recorded mass killings by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, the city’s head, Buchi Anatoly Fedorouk, reported that 280 people had been buried in brotherly graves.
On April 3, the Attorney - General of Irina Venediktov stated that 410 bodies of killed civilians had been removed from the area of Kiev, which had been released from Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, announced a full - scale invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian troops are shooting and destroying key infrastructure objects, firing massive shots at residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, fire-reaction systems, ballistic missiles, air bomb.

We promised that if you went to school, we'd bring you a surprise.
It would be great, I have two months' rent, the Olomouc district doesn't matter, I'm very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the savage treatment of civilians north of Kiev.
The pictures of the people who were tortured and shot were confusing to the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?
It's what I've been waiting for, and it's what I've been waiting for.
I took the children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
And then the girls and the kids, and only then did they go back to work in the capital.
Since 2014, I've been able to help the FDA consistently, and I have no doubt that in the case of the occupation of the suburbs of Kiev, my family will not be spared.
Because I've been and I'm pretty sure that the essence of the rotten Communist-KGBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it just can't exist; it's built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in the city of Gitomir.
A few years ago, the Jewish S.B.S.A. was given a copy of the shocking case of the great - grandfather — over a hundred pages to the right, and the death sentence was very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was illiterate, the guilt denied.
The ethnic Pole, the Catholic, had five children, was of free people, poor "one-two" nobles, never walking in cobblers.
The fact that he lived on a hamlet and had several cows was enough to condemn the peacock and nurse of young children to death.
The relatives did not even know where to bury them.
She said that nearly a hundred people had been taken from the village and killed except two who had agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case, there's the name of Shari's knocker.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I'm not surprised if it was his relative who was a KGBist informant.
An apple from an apple tree is, as you know, falling....
The shooting triad that condemned the execution of the peasants was the ethnic Russians.
As he examined the case, he became interested in various information resources.
There's great information resources in Russia, such as the Unmortal Barack, that are qualitatively reminded of the events of those years.
So in modern Russia, the descendants of the NCWDs found ways to punish and destroy almost all those who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 or 80 years ago.
The people who found the mass graves of the victims of the Stalin repression and publicly wrote the names of the murderers were first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like they found child pornography files on the computer, they put her in jail, and he died very soon.
The KGBs are still killing people who are trying to learn the truth about crimes of the last century.
Why, then, do you suddenly wonder at their actions now?
The most disgusting features of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries have been built up in the thousand-year-old Ordinian tradition.
And then the thing that came out was done by a beastly genetic experiment, by cutting out the intelligence in a few waves of red terror.
Look at the 1992 half-French movie "Chequest," that's what happened.
You saw my pictures in the bathroom.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from cough?
Sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I still wanted to ask maybe you know where the kids went because Gala can't find them.

According to European Truth, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in Ukrainian government circles.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 gabs, including a study kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As is suggested in the APC Boxer version for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to climb relatively close to the enemy’s targets, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire more than 20 miles [30 km] away.
As the Ukrainian government circles report with a link to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-sustaining hooks will follow a circular scheme.
In the shortest terms, the Bundesver will give Kiev 100 of its habitors, and the gaps that have been created will then be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new hookers may be delivered 30 months after the contract was signed, earlier in the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.
And this is us in the morning, or in the afternoon together?

The doves are: in the pot, I cultivate a tomato paste of 0.5 quarts [0.5 L] of water for 3-4 tablespoons of tomato pasta, which leads to boiling.
I teach the doves in a pot and fill them with this sauce.
It's about 1.5 hours dead in the oven.
How much money do I have on this number?
I have to bring it all in.
Monday 4.
4. In 2022, war refugees in Ukraine can ask for humanitarian assistance at a new job site in the Office of the Labour Market in Prague.
The branch office in Room No. 29 is specifically designed to file and process requests for help, so there is a translator on the spot.
Lydia's in school, but we're gonna go to the teacher's Tuesday night because of the illness.
I'm sitting, holding earphones, listening to music and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I feel like we're together, that we're couple.
I'd say after the war there'll be a lot of work.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I don't know what's going on with the apartment.
I need to be tested for a food license.
Please tell me tomorrow we have five guests to prepare the flat.
Is this where I'm in the room with the TV?
Stir and make a couch?
Can we stop at your place while Mrs. Margaret finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new ones you've used, but they're working, but they don't need it.
Write an address in Czech, look at the map where it's from us.
I don't know how much free space there is, so I can't plan with the furniture I want this week to finally look at that apartment and then figure out what furniture I need.
Sorry I've been responding for so long, working day, hard to adapt.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, have this opportunity to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how nice you are.
There's already a bed and a bathroom for the baby, and I've got it for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me when you had the opportunity, but don't give me the last one.
I want to make a haircut called a cap.
She's better off not taking her to us so she doesn't get infected.
I'll only be a little bit later -- about 8:00 a.m., can I?
I don't want any misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm worried it's going to be okay!
Because we didn't even talk about it with these excretions!
I understand how important it is to you!
I'm not talking about myself. (It's just a top that I can't reach.)
How are you feeling today?
Hi, I'm sorry, I just woke up, slept badly.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was disappointed that Kolya and I had begun to translate the test badly yesterday.
I'm going to ask if Gregory Denisenka or maybe Jonashek) to help me with some mathematical ideas.
Maybe I could use them as well.
If that's possible, I want to pick up mathematical terms in the weekend.
The geometry is very complicated, but we have to work with Kolya to make sure that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for your test assignments.
We hope so too.
She's so happy about any gift she's given.
I'd like to connect the Internet to my Czech number.
Yesterday at the stop of 402 buses, I met Victoria, a Ukrainian woman.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed that we would be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine to have a feeling of friendship.
The branch in Room No. 29 is specifically designed to file and process requests for assistance
Turns out I ordered a back-up card
Don't, I'm just a man.
So she wouldn't be afraid no one's coming.
I didn't go, I did it myself, I could do it, and the main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babin Yar Memorial Center in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yare.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of State, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and their way of life in territorial integrity, peaceful and secure Europe.
That's the foundation that we have to protect -- it's also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "wicked demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, “there can be only one answer for us Germans: never more!
The fight must go on."
Today Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the inhabitants of its blocked cities, and caused them to die of disease.
Russian troops have carried out mass shootings by Ukrainians, even visually, in the form of shootings in Babina Yara.
For over a month, the Germans see it in real-time news.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons that have not been imagined in the past.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy arms needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than speaking out against swastika.
That means fighting all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way to win and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine without the risks and victims.
One song for you tonight.
We agree, make arrangements for a tour, and write down when you're together.
All were sick except Lydia. They had an omicron of a new kind of valor.
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm using this plate instead of the kar
Call your documents late.
The ticket cost me 2,000 girths.
Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership was no longer a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against NATO, and only 18% of those polled were in favour.
After the Decay Revolution, the flight of Victor Janukovich, the annexation of Crimea, and the outbreak of the war, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, and the number of supporters of NATO began to rise.
Since the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO — more than 75 per cent of Ukrainian citizens.
Despite support for Ukraine's entry into NATO and the assistance that NATO is doing in war conditions, there are now many criticisms about the Alliance and the member countries – for the late delivery of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the reluctance to “crush” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will have to give up the desire to join the Alliance because of its position of the Russian Federation if it can stop the war and Ukraine will have reliable security guarantees, including military guarantees.
In the new episode of "Cursed Questions", together with the editor of "European Truth", we're talking about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the time of the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our vision of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why the security assurances discussed at the talks with Russia can be the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is right here?
I've got a volt partner that's what my application is for.
I gave it to you through this mobile app.
We don't have a visa, we have to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was formed in Poland, and we didn't give it, but we gave it to the pesel.
We'll have to write to you!
Fuck Denis, he's in a good mood today.
I made an appointment with a boy from Ukraine who I met yesterday to meet him at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
'Cause I don't like it, I'm missing for a long time.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic sent T-72 tanks and infantry combat vehicles to Ukraine
I'm going to leave the kids alone waiting there for three or four years and going home because I can't leave anymore.
Take 'em with you for 6-7 a.m.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he didn't act so well, so I left him.
After a while he returned and apologized.
I turned him down.
Then, after a while, he phoned for heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I was psychologically supportive of him for almost half a year.
During this time, we had a lot of communication.
I had problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me back then.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe we really need to look at it differently.
And he asked me to get married, and two days later he died.
Thus, God has determined our own destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to tell you that I was able to find a place to live, and I'm very glad I have a place to live now and a place to be with the baby.
Should I have remembered before?
( ) Because I was helping to look at the children in the family.
Don't apologize, just write down the words you didn't understand.
I understand myself that a translator does not always correctly translate the text
I don't know how to talk to a doctor or how to give him paper?
It must've been forgotten. I put it in the closet.
It's probably time for you to go to bed to work tomorrow.
Or anyone can help, you need things for a woman the size of XS or S is 165 and for her daughters (8,10.12 years old) Thank you.
Then in the ice, I bought two packs and Mom bought two
It's very nice of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
Okay, give me something else, and I'm still awake, and I'm falling asleep, and I dream of bombing...
God is never late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:)
I understand very well the price of unskilled work and I realize that a job like I had at home in Kiev I can't have it here and the money I made at home I won't get it right now.
But I just sit there and I can't do anything, because then all the bad thoughts go into my head, so I have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are being sent from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and at other times you can just wait.
Vladimir came back at 4:00 in the morning.
So we took them to our home.
We slept with Vica in the kitchen, and they were put in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and accompany them to the airport.
When you have it, write it and you'll know what's next...
I can't find a place anymore.
Sir, these are Ukrainian children's invitations to go to gymnasium.
Yeah, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, write me when it's comfortable.
I wish I could get my kids into kindergarten and school.
That's what we planned.
I'm sorry, I don't really have any missed calls from Wednesday.
I'm offering work, cleaning the bathroom and toilet, washing 3 windows, drying the dust.
Work is about three to four hours, 800 grand a day, from 1904 on Tuesday, from 2 p.m.
I hope I'll tell you just now we're good.
Can I call you?
Or can you write your wife's contact?
Grishko started coughing, I want to ask you what I can buy from the drugstore.
I'd like some advice.
We have Anna's native name, Anja.
She passed her uncle out of the house.
Made an English version, added new partners
Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget about me, please.
Are Monday and Wednesday classes different?
Thank you very much.
To be in a pool, we need help
But that's my opinion.
My uncle gave her skates and a skating board out of the house, she was riding them at home, so it has
I'm also up at 9:00, and I'm just cooking breakfast.
I'm very ashamed you're talking to me on your weekend, and I hope I'm not too tired.
We want to report a change in the home, and we want to present the documents for the card to continue.
We're now providing medical oxygen to all the hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you I'd have a snack for tomorrow.
One mother said it was hot for kids with jam donuts.
He's coming to visit you.
Please tell me, do you have at least an approximate schedule of cleaning your apartments a month ahead of time, even though for the sake of understanding, on what days?
I can't remember this schedule.
The Russian army is threatening to launch rocket attacks on Kiev: they say they haven't done this before.
Konashenko's direct language is, "We're seeing the diversion attempts and the task of the Ukrainian troops hitting the sites in the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously been held."
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kiev from the early days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian occupation forces.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that hit the Ukrainian PPO system fell on a apartment building in the Capital Poznays.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a multistory view on the Avenue of Valery Lobanowski.
On March 1, the Russians hit a television station near Babina Yar, killing five passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian PPO systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense's building over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, pieces of rocket hit by the occupiers destroyed a building and a trolley bus on Kurenitz in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential array on the Vinogradar, killing one person, and wounding 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern TRC Retroville on the Vinogradar, killing at least four people.
The mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klyczko, reiterated April 13 that residents of the capital who had been evacuated from the city were about to return early.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians were still able to launch missile attacks on Kiev and that there were many mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
On April 12, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence General Intelligence warned that the Russians were planning a series of attacks in the territory of the Russian Federation to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil bomb exploded near Belgrade in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
Early in April, the local authorities of Belgrade claimed that a Ukrainian shell had fallen near the city.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing in a cold sweat from the very idea that the Nazi fighters will strike Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Selskie is speaking to them, not so much, but to their voters and their societies as a whole.
By his talks in parliaments and in front of the multi-millionth crowds in the major cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
He doesn't persuade European politicians to do anything for Ukraine, he's convincing the European people who choose those politicians.
And these talks, this elegant alloy of strength, the warmth and the times of despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
As long as the same Byden is categorically opposed to the closing of the sky, 70 percent of its fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against the speed of Ukraine's introduction, it's already going on.
I understand, so I don't want to be seen as frauds.
The costs you collect are better given to those who need it.
I can come and decide if I want to help.
But the air is clear, that's plus.
It says I have a "One on Two Without the Internet" tariff, I asked you to make the Internet.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we have any other room today?
So I'm on my way and what you're doing is you're a train.
But I'm not gonna stop loving you, you're all for me.
This loan is handled by a financial consultant.
So it takes a few days.
Cata asked about the Internet, could I give her a password?
I thought you and Milan didn't shoot each other.
Super then my husband will drive me because he's got a car today from the building firm where he works.
How happy and grateful we are that our grandchildren and Nick are under your protection!
Thank you very much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
one has to be cut into four sections.
One of these particles can be used for two to three days, but every hour of stripping.
I'm interested in architecture and color.
I'm glad you're okay.
It's likely, at 4:20 p.m., that the concert will begin at 6: 00 p.m., and then I'm free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet.
So I'll make some tea and give you some candy.
I went to the school page and I'm going to try and get Anny lunch for tomorrow.
But I like to go out on weekends.
So can we go over there tomorrow, get the terms?

He is very much involved in helping people to see what they are worth and what they have to do.
If you don't need a pro-list, I won't put it on.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
By the way, you didn't want to write me tonight... for some reason.
Don't worry, I'm not here to ask for anything.
I'm asking for more attention today.
I have so much to say today, so I ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, you go to work, you plan shopping, you plan vacations.
You have dreams.
You're planning on buying that dress you saw at the mall yesterday.
Tomorrow night after work.
Your mosaic can't take it.
He's clinging to the old reality.
You call your job, find out if you're going to work tonight or not.
You decide to leave them at home.
As long as something becomes clear.
There's hope... this isn't for long.
There's going to be... something to be done.
The brain refuses to accept...
I don't have anybody anywhere.
I have $50 in my pocket.
Many of our leaders have not been paid in our jobs.
Where do I go?
You don't have the ability to take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything out of your house, okay? You drive 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning till evening, you drag kids all over Prague.
I don't know how many kids ask for sweets, and you can't... you're expensive.
And from each of these, we don't have one.
We have a choice: stay there and expose the children to danger or try to escape here.
She was very happy with the hearts and things the kids gave her when she came to school.
I should have called when you came.
I'll text you tonight.
Yes, I believe in God and I trust in him for my life.
I don't have the strength to do that anymore.
I thought you were in love with some Ukrainian girl and you didn't have time to talk.
I've already ordered it from the menu.
2. Would you be interested in sharing arrangements with your Czech neighbors, friends, and community?
If so, what kind of species, species.
Please send a visa page or an introductory seal.
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian assistance.
Mrs. Libusz, did you pay for the crèches?
Because I can't understand.
You are doing us so much good.......
We owe you a lot of debt... thank you!
Yeah, I know it's very good.
I'm going to drop your photo of the lady's card I'm learning English.
Well, what do you write tomorrow, whether or not I'll see you, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We've got enough money.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
You're busy tomorrow, don't you want to meet after 4:00?
What a general impression you've had since the first week.
Karina brought us medication the other day, and we drink it.
I can work with sick and disabled children.
But I must say I speak only Russian and Russian.
I don't have it.
May I wash your soap for the mill?
Because there's only an antibacterial gel.
I'm not sure if I'm not going too far into the city.
What services/activities do you think are needed/missing for the elderly?
I don't know, because I haven't had a text from the bank yet and I haven't taken the bank card and the kids have removed the bank's attachment by doing this and they've upset me a lot.
Then write to me as you go.
Today we have joy - our city of Bouch has been set free from the occupiers, and our troops have gone.
It's cleaning off the enemy, looking for Russians in basements and apartments.
The whole city's been replaced, demining will begin.
And John would've seen if there was something to be repaired or something to be done.
Diane, whatever you want, maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
The Panas we want to stay at home, says he's tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We're going to make some corn and we're gonna do some classes.
These are small entrepreneurs who opened volunteer headquarters in their homes and shops.
These are tractors that are actually coming out of the field under fire, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree today to drive in rubber terminals to temporarily occupied territories to take relief supplies and to take people there.
They are heroic leaders who move safely into the war zone, calm and help refugees in the cars, and help volunteers to get a humanitarian into the cars at peace stations.
It was the gas station that stood on the Zhitomir Road during the early days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous people.
They are commissaries who carry garbage under fire, repair water lines, and power lines to provide needed supplies.
They are doctors and nurses who rescue people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and they are still volunteering to collect pharmacies on the front.
We're in Ukraine, we're out of juice when little ones have leaves.
Please tell me, little children -- what age do you mean?
My daughter is eight years old, is that acceptable?
I'm looking for accommodations for my daughter and me for three or four days every day to come to Czechia and hand over passports for my visa to Canada.
There's a lot of people in Warsaw at the visa center and they don't work on-line.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, it's taking a long time on the train, it's gonna be hard for the kid.
So I decided to find a home in or near Prague.
No, we're fine.
Yesterday’s Tools Where to Be Taken
But I can't change the password when I follow the link, because I get this wrong:
It's in the microwave, it's burning.
In Ukraine, the biggest bank operators are always in contact with customers 24 hours a day and all questions are resolved quickly:)
It's okay to get used to new realities.
I don't like it, and I want you to know that.
You can edit the post.
Yeah, the TV's full of it.
We've already arranged for the refrigerators to have some Czech guys respond by 1:00 p.m. and help us move.
I want to go to you and hug you and kiss you.
At 7: 30 p.m. I read the history of the World Theatre to Actors, Directors and Theatres.
Tonight, I appreciate the projects. After dinner,
The mushroom's still asleep, crying very much at night, licking its tooth.
I'm on the phone right now with everyone I know from Lviv, and a lot of people have died.
The Czech Republic began issuing visas after March 22, after mine.
By that time, they were putting images like this and then comparing them to a cart.
The foreign electoral district of Ukraine (U.S.A.) is an electoral district that unites electoral areas outside Ukraine and consists of voting facilities in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and military bases abroad, with Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and Democratic Congo).[1] The role of the District Electoral Commission for the Foreign Electoral Region is played by the Central Electoral Commission.
In the Foreign Electoral Region, there are only state-wide ballots — presidential and national elections and all-Ukrainian referendums.
There are no local elections in the VMS.
They're at the station next to the mother's and baby's room.
Says he doesn't know where they're going anymore.
Are you angry at me?
I'm going to go delete the photograph in the bathtub.
I don't need money anymore. I borrowed it from a friend for a long time.
I wanted to say I've already connected a Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device, I went to O2 and they made me an electronic SIM map that I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
I'm very uncomfortable, Sunday works and I can't do it anymore.
You said you had a broken washing machine.
We don't have enough blankets, swell blankets, plates. The kids don't have pajamas and don't have anything to rewind.
Good morning, I'll be leaving at 10:00... write another address where the text is missing.
I don't want to torture you or me, I'm gonna hurt myself.
That would be a good thing, but I know there wasn't a place to go, and in principle they're having all the scheduled lessons right now, and they're teaching pretty well.
Do you have meat to make a farce?
Good for you after Easter.
Did your mother tell you something hurt you last night?
She can't tell them everything she wants, and she doesn't understand everything they say.
Today I too went to school.
Today I saw Christina’s mother, but she didn’t even say hello.
Very delicious apples, what kind of apples is that?
President Andrey Hermank's head of the office said that Russia was starting a "fee surgery" about the weapons that the allies are handing over to us.
Hermak's direct language is, "They realize that they're losing the war, seeing that they're backward, and they're trying to "kill" the arms supply in any way.
For example, one of the last of the fairies is the destruction of the C-300-transmitted FARDC by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What's going to happen next is we know the Russian scenarios, and I'll call one of them.
They can launch fairies that Ukrainian soldiers surrender with allied weapons, and it's massing into the Russian army.
I want to warn you of these fairies right away.
Because weapons in the hands of U.S. soldiers only send an enemy to that world.
Excuse me, did you forget to ask how much bull would cost a garden in the moon and would it work in the summer?
Each one is given according to his own strength.
There are much sadr stories, believe me.
So I had to survive to change.
In Torah it is written, and God created a wicked beginning in man so that during the course of life it might change spiritually, become better
It's your home, you can invite whoever you want)

Your father may have told us that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses among us, but I do not practice any religion.
However, she was baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all religions based on love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, and began reading the Torah.
I believe that there are no intercessors between man and God.
You can think of putting the refrigerator outside the door of the boys ’ room.
Thank you so much for helping me.
We're looking for a sedative for the usual cleaning of houses here in the village.
It's 150 kroner/year, and it's another collaboration with them.
I got an ammonia ffarb in my eye, and I'm afraid of chemical care, and I might be examined by a doctor?
I'm just worried about how we're gonna communicate with you.
But we can just look at each other's jokes.
I went alone to my mother, and there my sister and her friend were going to go, and Anastasia asked them.

At the end of each description, you have contact with the owner.
You can use this online translator from Ukrainian to Ukrainian and vice versa.
Anyway, we're four on the same bed in the room where you can't even get around, thank you very much.
Well, did you click the links I sent you above?
In each of these you have a free supply of housing, a description, a contact with the owner and a picture.
I can't contact only an enamel, and I don't think I'm going to be able to find a place closer to the Czech Krumlov, where we work in the Czech Kremlov and now we live in Prague.
I'm not going to help you.
Thank you for helping us, we found a place to live, but we need a bed and a couch maybe show us where we can buy not too much because we have a weak budget, thank you very much.

We cleaned up the whole room and moved into the other room.
The international community continues to express shock and resentment after evidence has emerged that the Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as “provoking”.
“Reports of killed, raped and seriously injured by Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians are to be condemned”, said New Zealand Prime Minister Jasinda Adern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer the world for what they have done”, she added, noting that her Government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
The Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kissida, called the incidents “a violation of international law”.
The announcements were made following reports that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into fraternal graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Buchi, by Russian troops who had left the area after their occupation for several weeks.
The pictures, which allegedly depicted the bodies of the executed civilians with tied hands, shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
President Emmanuel Makron of France stated in a radio interview on April 4, that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bush.
“What happened in Bush requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures”, said Makron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian coal and oil exports.
The Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, claimed that Russian troops could go so far as to have committed a “genocide” in Bush.
“We will make sure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” Sánchez said in Madrid.
On public television late April 3, Maria Zacharova, the spokesman of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rejected the charge as “provoking”.
She claimed, without proof, that the United States and NATO had “convicted” images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first few minutes after the material was made makes no doubt about who “proposed” this story," said Zechariah.
In the past, the Ministry of Defense of Russia also claimed, without evidence, that the image of Buchi was “a further ruling of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called the "provoking Ukrainian radicals" in Bush.
On April 4, the Russian Investigative Committee issued a statement declaring “investigation” for allegations of Ukraine's “knowingly false information” about the actions of the Russian forces in Bush.
On April 3, the president of Ukraine, Vladimir Greenski, charged the Russian troops with a genocide in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they were supposed to come to Butchi to see what their troops had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see their orders being carried out," said Selskie in the video, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting in the back," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of the victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, a city about 20 miles [35 km] northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a Ukrainian Service correspondent, Radio Liberty, saw some sort of civilian body on the streets of a small city.
In just one place, a reporter found up to 10 bodies on the street.
Journalists AP saw the bodies of at least 21 people in different places in Buchi.
The bodies of one group of nine — all in civilian — were scattered on land near a place that the locals said Russian forces used as a base.
The victims seem to have been killed from a very close distance.
In all, the Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in the Kiev area, which until last week had been controlled by Russian troops.
Thanks for everything, we bought everything on the list.
"They said, "Kieva's gone," "when the occupiers took the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus."
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
There is another item on this list that is currently far from known — the movement of the local population to enemy territory.
Since about mid-March, Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied communities into their territory and that of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko has actually placed under the Russian military force.
The "Truth of Ukraine" found the Ukrainians who had been deported and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" was taking place and whether there were ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The characters of this text were forced to leave the country under psychological pressure and no way out.
Fortunately, they're alive and in contact with family members.
However, in view of the claims of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were forced to leave for Russia and Belarus.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the personnel of the second maternity home, took the children out of there without the parents, including 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of the dead Ukrainian champion on the voyage of Joseph Zapensky.
The family of Alexander, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter, Vally, moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander was the first to get a job at Antonov Airport, which is about five miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in the territory of a military town, although they were civilians.
As true plateaus, Dennis and Marina had collected disturbing suitcases ahead of time, but the morning of February 24 failed to evacuate.
They didn't have their own car, and the suburban buses didn't take anyone anymore.
At about 12: 00 p.m. on February 24th, they saw helicopters with a letter V followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighbor’s house.
Then the family went down into the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17th, when the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, there were about 40 people in their basement.
Not everyone has decided to eat.
"At 6 p.m. on February 24, people came to the driveway, and they didn't speak Russian, and they didn't speak Ukrainian.
They say, "There's a who?" I say so. "Get out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there was a weapon.
All the men were questioned whether they had served in the army.
The women said, "We came to protect you, as directed by Ramzan Kadirov."
It was the Chechen MOON, not even the military, young boys 25-35 years old.
They said, "We were assisted in the war by the Ukrainians, Sasko Bilij (running the Una-Union of the Una-Union, which was fighting on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Cheinn war – UV), and now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we needed.
We say the water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke up the store, they took the goods from there, they took the Russians anyway, and they brought us six of them.
There's a video on the Internet where kids thank Kadirova for food.
So that's what they did after the shop was looted and they said, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need video for Ramsan Ahmadovic."
Nobody wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid says, "You have seven days to give up our phones" -- they laughed.
And they kept separating themselves from the Russians.
They said, well, they did come because they didn't want wars, the Ukrainians supported the Ukrainians, and they said, "Putin is a bastard, Kadiv, too, but there's nothing we can do because our families are there."
And mostly they weren't fighting, but they were going to rob shops, they were pillaging.
The chicken was picked up, and one was tied to one leg of the Georges Strip, and the other was their white scotch and they called it "sill."
They arrived in Ukraine unprepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence was working... when they were beaten in the Bouchi, so they didn't even take the dead, they said to us, "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had built - up squads — Chechens didn’t know each other, and during the first days, we asked for passwords to find out whether we were strangers or not.
We had them until March 13th, after which the Russian MON arrived, followed by the Omas Air Force.
They put 30 or 40 pieces of technology between the houses – ours were constantly coming into it from the Beiractars.
But these came and told us that the DMS is gone, but there's "Azza," and they say "Azova" is like that in Ukraine.
The "Kyev's Surrendered" has been on its way since early March.
One day a Russian officer, or a representative of the FSB, came to see us and said there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- it was about Bouch, Gostomel, and we thought maybe we had a green corridor.
Right from the beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian Command.
But they tell us, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
They said, "So pity the mentality of your children!"
As it worked, they took us into the basement and started shooting us from under the house - or "Grades," or mortars.
And then it came back... and neighborly houses were just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
The part didn't go, saying it was for traitors in their homeland, saying, "You're going to be shot, you're going to be sold to organs."
We were taken across Chernobyl, and on both sides of the roads there were potions, broken equipment, even though the Belarusians told us that the Russians were taking the equipment to them immediately.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment, and soldiers.
We went through improvised control at the Belarusian Comar crossing, and many people were completely undocumented because they were burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, and tea was given.
And here we hear shots fired, and the rocket is firing, and you can see it's lskandar working on Kiev.
Although these ones from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these are planes flying, turning across the border."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
We were then loaded into a bus and taken to the Chonky Sanatorium near Gomel.
And his boss, Wenger Vasil Stéphaniewicz, comes and says, "Here I am Hohol, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves get you.
The poor people are suffering!
We've got Lukashenko so good!
He will say, and it will be."
They asked for interviews with Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium said to us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and from the United Nations -- at least so-called -- spread disinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a document problem, and my daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to get him on Monday, and on Thursday, the war broke out.
The Ukrainian Consulate didn't help us anything, and at Minsk, the station said nobody would take anyone on the bus without passports.
I'll tell you what the Belarusian volunteers really helped us.
We were sent to Minsk, where we were accompanied.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
Our second migration representative said you could stay here for a maximum week or one and a half because Belarus isn't Europe, there's no payout here.
We found an internal transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled about 30 miles [50 km] from the Ukrainian border — U.S. — we saw ballistic missiles launched throughout Ukraine — the rocket first flies out, shines beautifully, and then goes out.
The people who boarded the bus in Mozira told me that the Russians were shooting at the polygons all the time.
But I can say that the Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
Generals are fired from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was called on.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, is not believed at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
They don't realize that their polygons are used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we're going through the registration process, deciding what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, the English flags are now probably as many as the Estonian flags."
Marina lived in a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family, his wife and two children, in the 18's and 22's.
On the morning of February 24, she phoned her nephews and asked them to collect the basics and documents.
At night they went to sleep in the basement of a nearby building.
Marina herself can't come home and she can't come back. She's gone.
No one knew anything about evacuation.
Can't you get anywhere in the center on Monday?
Thank you, we've got everything. And we've always been waiting for you!
Thank you for the deal, the moths are beautiful.
And this little apartment doesn't have a Wyfai, and I'm basically answering all your questions, and now I don't know how to be, and kids on Monday have online classes, and the Internet isn't available.

On April 1 the city’s head, Buchi Anatoli Fedoruk, delivered a joyful message – the Ukrainian military released the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day the occupiers were thrown out of the entire district of Kiev.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would have felt at this time was overshadowed by the horror and hatred that at the same time it became evident that at least 280 civilians had been shot by the Russians in Buchi alone.
They were killed right on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back, some of those killed were minors.
The chief of the village of Motijin, Olga Suhenko, and her husband, Igor, and his son, Alexander, were found murdered on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the fraternal grave, Igor, in the sewers.
On the side of the road 20 km from Kiev, the bodies of several naked women were found wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there's no one at home.

President Vladimir of Selski stated that certain types of armaments provided by Western partners were too late.
He said that in an interview with the Associated Press, which was published by the Office of the President, he wrote "European Truth."
"All the equipment, all they have already sent, for some types of equipment it's done too late.
So what, when we talk about, for example, Mariopolis, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their positions, but you can see the price of these changes," said Zelenski.
And to the question, this is enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would be no such war, or it would look different.
"It would open differently, we would have the shoulders of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be any war," he added.
Remember, the British Prime Minister promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armoured equipment and anti-ship weapons.

Today, a new girl from Ukraine appeared in the garden.
I didn't even touch the door, and she called.
If I understood the Director correctly, he said that if I worked in the garden, I could come to work some day for as many hours as I could get.
If so, I will be able to go to work, for example, for a few days a week for several hours.
For how many hours and what days I'll be watching to get out of me so that I'm fashionable and clean up the apartments, there's more cleaning paid so I don't want to give up that job.
I'm a water-supply technologist, so I feel it right away.

Thank you very much for your concern.

He was a very rich man, but he liked me because I had my point of view on life I met him, and then I left him.
He was a very wealthy man, and after a while he called and told him that he had had heart surgery.
I asked him to talk to me and support me, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man, and he thought I might be his toy and maybe I need his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"There was a car in my yard that looked like a crocodile, and she was putting out hailstones.
And they kept me in the house, and then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, breathing was nothing.
And what about the housing that you dropped
I haven't really got there yet.

All right, he'll come over there and get them.
I'm not greedy for anything.
I understand I can't sit at your place. I need to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or any Ukrainian television.

"I tell her "the TV and radio repair" has been delayed by import details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to say too much when they call."
"We've been hiding a war infestation from my mother-in-law for a month.
So far it's working.
However, the fur on the pus and back paws of the comb is a result of stress, a change in the food supply, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but the stress doesn't depend on me, unfortunately.
Unlike her mother-in-law, she's deaf, and she's hearing both sirens and explosions."
Because Olga has a hearing problem and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her incognito.
On April 1rd, 93-year-old Oksana Paulov took up arms for the first time in his life.
"33 days I lived with her in an apartment.
The war was hidden from her, and what I was around was formally there for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver, and she listened for four hours, and then she sang for two hours."
The radio receiver was always at the bedside.
Most of the time a mother - in - law spends in her room.
It's bad, it's allowed me to be imperceptible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "quicks," I was hiding in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
And then I called everybody who's talking to her, and that's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning until the end.
It's April 17 - I'm cleaning 2 apartments:

A British man who defended Mariopol in the ranks of the U.S.A. says he's ready to surrender to the Russians.
The British, who is a member of the U.S. Army Marines Brigade, who is involved in Mariupoli’s defense, told his friends and family that they would take up arms and surrender to Russian occupiers.
Source: The twitter page of Aydin Eislin, a British who has been serving in the WCC since 2018, the Air Force, with reference to Aislin's family and friends, Atlas News, with reference to Aislin's friend's words, who spoke to him
So literally twitter Eislin, we got a message from him, "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariopol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian army.
We had no food and ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will soon end."
Aislin was a member of the 36th separate NSA Marine Corps, which is involved in Mariupoli's defence operation.
The Air Force journalists contacted En Wood's mother, and she confirmed that her son was on the phone that they were planning to surrender.
A military friend, Brennan Philips, also confirmed to journalists that in the last telephone conversation, Eislin had described plans for their capitulation unit.
He said that the brigade had run out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted a friend of his who said that Aeslin's unit intended to surrender to the Russian units, so that they would not get shot and hit the so-called "Cadian" squads without weapons and bullets.
Also on social networks were audio recordings of a telephone conversation that Aislin was talking to his familiar American friend, who is planning to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Aislin said that they were trying to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British said earlier that in Instagram he had been threatened by representatives of a private military company called Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark and Trent in Nottingemshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight the so-called "Islamic State" terrorists in Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the U.S.A.S.A. and took an oath.
Elsla's friends and close friends were called Johnny, and on social networks, he's more famous under Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know whether we're together or not.
But it won't be easy, you'll have to find him...
You offered to come with you, I agreed if you'd be okay.
Thank you, as long as you don't have to, you've done so much for us, we're so grateful to you.
If you don't ever want to write to me, I'll wait.
Hi, Natalie, please pour the flowers outside by the front door.
I'd like to learn Czech, too.
I'd like you to take some rest and think of yourself.
I'm sure you're gonna have to put face cream on tonight.
Yeah... thank you very much. I didn't even expect to see such a man, your health and your luck!
Little Doshan's not ashamed anymore?
Onjrzej and his father came to visit us.
No one went in again, even though there were many magicians on the street.
We're home today.
The kids are learning lessons, they're playing right now.
I have to go to Leedle in the afternoon to buy some food.
You have me.
You know I love you.
I'll do everything for you.
How can I prove this love?

The climate is almost identical.
The family's fine, I've got my mom, three brothers, and a husband.
A brother to the war in Mariupoli, a second in Zaporozhye, and a man from Kiev today was transferred to Harkov.
Every day they say everything's fine, and whoever knows him, they won't tell the truth anyway.
I wanted to come to see you, but I wanted to get some stuff done.
I'll ask my husband in the morning if he can do it tomorrow.
When you get home, please write to me, I'd like to talk to Daniel.
The Bolsheviks assailants for their loss of battle have played full game.
The teacher, Dmitre Pavlicki, was shot and killed by his unknown relative, Boris Alexander.
Their bodies are thrown into “a deep bathtub, which has been buried in the earth”.
Behind the memories, "there was some dead silence in the city."
From house to house, one of the inhabitants ran eagerly.
The bodies of Bolsheviks were always met in the streets
I can't do it without you.
3. What will your own activity/activity help you or your friends to better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you're not going to make it because there's a remodeling of the railway and the entrance is closed.

A Better Future for Us

Well, we're gonna try and take us to social services Tuesday.
Then, when it cools down and the dough fits, the pebbles are turned on and they are roasted on a small oil fire.
Okay, I'm sure I'll ask him.
As soon as we set up tomorrow night, I'll pick it up Tuesday night.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because that was the last hope, the truth.
I am not afraid of my work, as I was living in a village, so I can and enjoy working physically.
When You Can Bring Things
You're very interested in the tradition, and we're doing this on Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council adopted draft resolution 7176, which is entitled "Achieving the Monitoring of Potential Threats to National Security in Ukraine in the Economy."
It's amazing that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere has proved to be... the meeting place of members of the supervisory board of companies and heads of banks.
Initiators believe that decision-making by the executive board of the state of Kiev can somehow solve Ukraine’s national security problems.
We know of a lot of new threats to the companies, but so far no company that requires physical meetings of the supervisory board at the location is unknown.
The potential threat posed by such a law has been understood as an excellent basis for putting an end to all gains in the heavy enterprise reform following the Hygiene Revolution, including independent oversight boards, and then setting up manual management.
That's what it was before 2015.
Why are the oversight boards in charge, and who should be involved?
What's more – if under patriotic slogans one harmful billing projector is going to take off tomorrow, others can take off tomorrow – for example, government procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the U.S.
A lot of things you can write into war.
By the way, this initiative came before the war and the piece of legislation, 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this rule was added to the comparative table of draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse oversight boards in one way or another has been circulating among some of the popular electors for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but to show the possible consequences of the bill, let us examine the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then let's give our suggestions on how to deal with the management of entrepreneurship in time of war.
The first deputy economic minister, Denis Kudin, explained the need for such innovation to be at risk of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make it impossible for the oversight boards to function remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the board of directors will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which could be paralysed by the company's work.
We agree that this is a risk, but will it be able to prevent members of the oversight boards from moving to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation in which independent members of the oversight boards (which make up the majority of the population) put their personal security ahead of the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In such a case, they could be released by law.
And then, most likely, it will lead to the loss of the quorum, the necessary oversight board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not quickly be possible to appoint new independent members of the board of oversight, since the law requires competitive selection, which averages three to four months.
Thus, the draft resolution 7176 is likely to be unable to prevent the oversight board from losing its ability to make decisions, but rather it will!
The People's Deputy, the author of the draft legislation, Dimitro Nataul, gives other arguments for his support.
In particular, he says, "many enterprises, such as the Defense and Industrial Complex (PKC), now need relocation," and so "it's hard to imagine that a human being, for example, can talk about addresses and other sensational information from Zoom Vienna."
To begin with, Ukraine has little or no entrepreneurship with oversight boards.
The board of directors is except in Ukrobarneprom, which essentially manages almost all of the DPC's businesses.
But even at Ukrobanprom, under legislation, the board of oversight has very limited powers, and all its members do not perform duties without payment.
The full power of Ukrobororom belongs to the Director-General, who will, by the way, decide on the necessity of relocating one or the other of the PKK enterprises that are part of the company.
Moreover, this argument does not stand up to criticism because drafter 7176 does not change any legislation that regulates the activities of PKK enterprises.
On his Facebook page, Mr. Dimitro also cites arguments that can be classified as "emotional."
Such arguments generally have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of companies and holdings, but let's try to understand some of them: " good alien experts at the first word "war" leave Ukraine in 2021, but remain members of the oversight boards in Ukraine's state-owned enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand dollars, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from war."
First of all, it's a manipulation -- most of these members of the board of oversight never lived in Ukraine, and only occasionally did they come here.
So it's fair to say that they're leaving Ukraine, to put it mildly.
Second, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian board members have long been engaged in online meetings.
This tool has long been widely used in world practice — in a wide variety of fields — business, education, medicine, and so forth.
We should also remember that membership in the oversight board is not a full-time job.
These people tend to have other jobs, and these are the electronic means that help them do it.
Third, all these claims are read as claims only to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dimitro not make identical claims to members of the Ukrainian oversight boards?
Because they're not behind their companies either.
In fact, it's not the first popular attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from oversight boards, and war is just a new opportunity.

In Brovarsk, Vischgorod, and Buchana districts in Kiev, which were exempt from the occupation, an increased curfew will be imposed for two days.
Pavluka’s direct language: “In the settlements of Brovarsk, Visgorsk and Buchanan districts under Russian occupation and released by the Ukrainian Defence Forces, the curfew has been increased!
These cities and villages will have restrictions from 9:00 a.m. on April 2 to 6:00 p.m. on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the neighborhood, it is strictly forbidden to travel on the streets of the population and in other public places, on transportation and on foot.
Residents can only go outside at the alarm signal to get to the shelter.
Such restrictions are imposed to remove the effects of Russian aggression — to clear and clear the territory.
Omelyank has called on people who have left these areas for the time being to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the country, the curfew will last from 9: 00 a.m. to 6: 00 a.m. every day.

After full-scale aggression against Ukraine, the Western countries took very seriously the predictions of a possible increase in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainen conflict is complicated and globalized.

The Lukashenko regime forces have detained three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years, who have been involved in the destruction of two handboards of an Osipović signalhouse, which enables railway trains to travel.
Source: Radio Svobada, M.I.G. Gennady Kazakewicz, a law-enforcement centre, quoted by the Belta State Information Agency.
MAF Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three Bobruisk residents were arrested and one wounded because of the strong support of SDRI agents.
According to The Springs, the men were actively opposed and tried to escape when they were delayed.
The security forces used their weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and in a medical facility.
Others were given local medical care.
The Head of the MAF Criminal Police of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, claimed that "terrorist acts on the RB railways will be severely stopped" by the military using weapons.
On April 6, it was reported that on March 30, the police arrested another member of the Belarusian Railway, a member of the Baranowitz Section of the BWC and an administrator of the BWC's thematic resources at Vkontaktie and One-Lessers, Valentine Samsuk.
Where he is now and in what state he is not known, @belzhd_live.
By the end of March, at least 40 railway workers had been detained in Belarus for the diversion.
We're reminded that the formation of Bypol, declared by Lukashenko's regime to be extremist, continues to call on the Belarusians to carry out diversions on railways and infrastructures in Belarus within the framework of the "Victory" plan.
Belarus's river guerrillas are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As we know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is turning over to fight, and Ukraine is living in power and technology.

U.S. bans investments in the Russian Federation and sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of President Putin, the largest banks of the Alpha Bank and Sberbank, and prohibiting all new investments in Russia.
That's what we're talking about on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia's largest financial institution, owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prevent U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
The United States will also ban new investments in the Russian Federation entirely.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Byden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by citizens of the United States regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision of over 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
Private sector output includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as legal and consulting firms” in the White House statement.
A third step in the new U.S. sanctions was the restrictions on major Russian state - owned enterprises in the critical area.
It will ban United States citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in United States jurisdiction.
Minffin's detailed list will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete freezing of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Lavrov's foreign minister, as well as members of the Security Council of Russia, including Dmitri Medvedev, the Russian Prime Minister and Prime Minister Michael Mishustin.
Sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.

My name was Olga, and before the war, I worked as a flight attendant for SkyAp, my mother, a seamstress of industrial products, and my son, Macarczyk, were in kindergarten.
We lived a beautiful life, and we did not think that we would be forced to flee because we no longer had the strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky enough to find a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we hope for the first time someone's going to take us in) we can even pay for a room or an apartment, but if we can afford it.
Clean and orderly.
We do not have harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.
I had one English lecture in the afternoon, and then I went to work in the children’s room.
I explained to Margaret how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands everything and will do well.
I also met Mrs. Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an ad from the pool.
It's a free swim.
You can call school, Kira doesn't take the phone, doesn't answer, I don't know if she went to school.
They isolate the Russian office: stop investment and stop supply.
However, we did not understand.
The military did not settle in our home.
Our home is near the military and oil fields.
He just helped me because I couldn't do it myself.
Delicately cook, do not ask for anything, and give good advice
I'm on my own.
It's a little hard for me, but I know I have to go through this stage.
I'll meet you on Thursday and tell you everything.
It's all right.
Gould, how often do you clean up?
I clean up every week.
I don't have any software, but I'll try and figure it out.
I dreamt of being a teacher
My girls can't move anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you if you could hear information about the house, you'd let me know.
I'd love to rent a place with some decent girl.
If you can know him, let him know.
I'm not going to let it down.
Thank you early.
I haven't written you another guy at 54 years of age. Please write the exact address and how much is the cost of the courses?
I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I haven't changed my name since I was born.
I'm sorry, I'll do it and I'll send you right away.
We're going to the medical commission.
I mean, you don't have to work this hour for another day.
On what day is it better for her to arrive early? ( Maybe on what day is a little more work?)
I'll listen to you tomorrow, the Internet is not working well.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thanks... some of the things they found, but there was nothing out of technology...
Both novices but the alphabet are unknown
Nothing's happening.
May I have Monday 25.04?
Children can be taken, toys are enough here:)
I figured out about Dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'll figure something out with that money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how it's gonna be paid, please, no loans.
Write me straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
You got to take that clothes you gave me?
It's not my day. It's been a long time since I've been in the living room.
Something came from you, I can't see.
I'm also very sad.
I'll remind you later of the invoice.
You're the only one who's got your dad talking and understanding Russian?
What day does a colleague want to clean a house, and how many windows?
I'm ashamed I'm distracting you from your business.
Good evening, I can't share it with you.
I suggest you read Joe Dispense, he's doing scientific research on external influences and the formation of new connections neurons.
A 1+1 television columnist, Natalie Nagorny, released a video in the morning of April 12th, which he was given to the 36th Marines Brigade of Mariupoli.
In it the military say that they had no weapons left to participate in the fighting, and the mountain was wounded.
They said "the score goes on for an hour."
Earlier, on April 11th, the 36th Marine Brigade, which is involved in Mariupoli's defense, published a statement to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement was that April 11 could be the last battle for the supporters of Mariupoli, and the Ukrainian military command had no contact with the fighters for two weeks.
The social media said that the statement was published in Russian.
The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valery Zalyna, assured us that there was a link between command and defence forces in Mariupoli and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of public debate.
The Russians threatened to block the Ukrainian combatants in the area of the Avostal factory in Mariupoli and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariopol.
Andrey Belecki, leader of Azova, reported that the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azztal plant, which is holding the Azov regiment fighters.
Thank you, I'll adapt to you.
The situation is the same as we're staying here for the time being.
Two hours ’ drive) walk, shopping, and back!
It's not important.
She forgot what she'd do here.
The Czech dronin squadron began flying over Ukraine from now on.
Almost 50 professional Coptics will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy the enemy.
Two Carpathians and two Czech brothers, the “birds” to Ukraine, were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to Mr. Vladimir Labuten, a deputy of the Mukaev City Council.
Today, their inter-rural friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplewhere101/ Vasil Schur, have been delivering drones to their assignments, and they have been given special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting is taking place.
In order to make the most effective and safe use of the Coptics, the locations of the Coptics will now be kept secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army to stop at what they've done say that in the very next few days, many more interesting gifts will be sent to Ukraine to serve as a means of destroying the Russian occupier and saving the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, I love sweet, but I can do it without him.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine soon, to continue my work.
If it's okay, I'll take it.
I'll try my own way, but if there's flashes, I'll text you if you can?
The key to understanding each other
We were personally in the old lady's village in Java, she saw me and I was pregnant but said there was no place to live.
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll get better.
I got my phone fixed today.
And I think I'm freezing on the street today.
I drank medicine and tea, and I feel worse, but I'm not critical.
I'm sorry, too, but it's better to meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, give me the music you like.
I wonder what you're doing with your music.
Mom and Dad Must Be Obedient
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
It was colder today and it's raining, and it's gonna be warm tomorrow.
But it's not a pity for the houses that have been destroyed, it's a pity for the people who are being abused by the occupiers.
In Kherson, the occupiers were huddled from the "Glory of Ukraine" memorial at Kherson on the street of Perescopesk.
It's said that the unknown have broken the flag of the European Union, broken panels with photographs of the sky hundreds and killed in the Russian and Ukrainian War.
The occupiers have broken off the portraits of the heavenly hundred heroes and the dead participants in the Russian-Ukrainen war.
The flag was removed.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for the Christmas carol, we don't have that custom, so we didn't know, we only gave the kids chocolate and cookies, maybe something else had to be given.
There's someone to talk to, if anything.
Because I'm living like a dormitory Until 12 people are here and then they go to work.
Hi, it's a little better.
I was already in the backyard today.
Even today, I was asleep there.
As a result, we have made great progress.
I'm sure I'll bring some cooks another time!
I don't have the power to do it.
Since I push away from the days and times when there is work to clean up after guests, I can say roughly a month for April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
By May, I could say a month or so by the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hey, I'm sorry I haven't had a long time to prepare dinner and slept a little.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or I'll meet you after you're here.
He's a modest man, he's been learning a lot lately.
It went very well.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people in such a high position.
Today I learned a lesson from a lady who is the director of the economics department of the highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
The greasy in the manger acted well.
On Monday, I have to provide confirmation of employment and cash wages for the day’s sake.
I've been lazy since Friday.
I'm not doing anything but doing a lot of them, and I'm sleeping . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If I'm going to see a doctor tomorrow and I'm going with you if I can.
I have to get another analysis.
You don't have to go again.
It doesn't work well, it does not work well, it does clean well, it needs a master, it needs to be fixed.
That's how it's done.
Can you send me the right e-mail?
I'd like to send you an invitation to the Czech language class you've enrolled in.
And are the children fed there, or should they bring them with them?
Now you can come in for a moment and ask one question.
If You Need Help, Write
If I'm right, you're celebrating the Passover tonight, right?
We didn't really want you to raise money from the beginning, so people don't think we're trying to do it!
But I didn't have two things to fill online:
I'm going to go to rest, and I'm going to have to get some energy and energy.
Now let's see, this is going to be a good idea because the whole family is going to draw.
Carazin University urges workers and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messing and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Only use official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who has stayed in Ukraine, is also assisted by the army
I've got a couple of papers for the portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet is to be held.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How do I count the day I was out of work is a pass?
Headquarters: Russia prepares a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against a neighboring state”.
Literally, "It is not possible for the armed forces to carry out acts of provocation in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring State."
Details: Opposer continues to form an offensive group of troops to act in the direction of Slobojan.
It is likely that in the very next few days, the occupiers will try to restore the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send individuals, weapons and equipment for fighting in Ukraine.
There's training of weapons and military equipment at the permanent location of the 60th separate Moto-Grandship Brigade (Monastic) of the 5th General Army Army of the Eastern Military Region.
It is likely that these weapons will be transferred to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk.
Also, in order to repair the loss of the individual unit of the Battalion tactical unit of the 36th individual Moto-Police Brigade (Borza, Zabaykal Krai), 29 army-wide army of the Eastern Military Region are recruiting military personnel from the same brigade.
A particular problem is that the enemy feels when he fills out the positions of driver and water mechanics.
The removal of the selected person from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
The enemy is likely to continue to attack the transport infrastructure in Ukraine with the aim of destroying or decommissioning the cargo to combat sites.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belori border in the provinces of Brussels and Gomel.
In the Slobojan direction, separate units of the 6th General Army and the North Navy coastal forces continue to partially block the city of Kharka, continue artillery shots on individual areas of the city.
In the Isum direction, an air reconnaissance site is under way to identify the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
The enemy uses Orlan-10 to do that.
By force of two Battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to attack in the direction of the population of Longgögne and Dmitrak, and he failed to succeed and moved to his earlier occupied positions.
In Donetsk’s direction, the adversary continues to focus on taking control of the population of Popasna, Rubiezne, Lower, and Novochmuthka, as well as full control of the city of Mariopol.
The enemy tried to attack the area of the Gold, and he was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, shelling and aviation continue to take place in the areas of the Avostal plant and the seaport.
In separate units, the enemy fired artillery shots at the positions of the Ukrainian forces in the areas of Viscopilla, Labour and Mariana.
In Donetsk and Lugansk, Ukraine's supporters during the past 24 hours have been targeted by four enemy attacks, five tanks have been destroyed, eight armoured units, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
You don't understand what you're thinking?
We'll try to make it, of course, but I doubt it.
And how could you want to sleep and I'll keep you awake?
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you don't want to see me tonight, so tell me, I'll understand.
We didn't watch TV at home, and much less 1+1.
I'm gonna turn on the TV just to listen to the Czech language.
I'm running out of tariffs for the month:)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy fabric for stitching, canvas, threads for stitching
I understand, I can prepare material in this area.
I'm a little ashamed to ask, she's giving us so many pies.
I'll see my father later, I'll be sure.
I read an ad on Facebook, I guess Google wrote something in his own way.
Good morning, we brought the things you brought, but are there the things you can bring them to us that are little in 10 minutes?
I've been thinking about the job.
If Mr. Director's good, I can start working next week because I'm planning on going to work tomorrow afternoon at the office of work to give the papers (if I can, because there's a lot of queues) and Saturday rain:
I'm looking for a team at the beginning, I like chemistry very much, I'm learning Czech to know perfectly, I want to work on Tevi.
Friends of old and not so much, friends I don't know personally, friends of the spirit and the mind.
Now you too have had difficult times.
During the past month, I have been associating with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy before, has been turned upside down, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilty and ashamed because of your country's actions toward your neighbors.
Because of why Ukraine is offered on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been threatened, and you've been preparing for a decisive strike.
Early in March, I wrote to Alexander Chercasov, my very old friend from the Memorial.
I'll tell you a little bit later – as usual, Sasha answered kindly. – Now we're going through the ruins after the search.
Others — cultural actors, artists, critics, writers — are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of very few of you — those who worked in the Memorial, the New Gazette, the Echo Moscow, the Medes, the Navali organization, and a number of other places — how many of you have done anything to counter this regime?
Except to participate in meetings while they were still taking place.
See also the column of Russian journalist "Stay late, keep quiet"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just abstraction?
Maybe they're caused by your long-standing indifference to what's going on around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which is now probably a heavy burden on your soul and heart.
It wasn't always like that.
There was a short period in the 1990s when you had some freedom and democracy -- messy even bloody but genuine.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why, every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of sadness that you seek salvation behind the king's back, his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel safer next to him.
Indeed, mistakes have been made.
Instead of captureing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took a soul on the Dzrzynski monument – and let the KGB lie low, update, transform and take control of the country.
When you were presented with a choice between a robbery of the country and a return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly accept the robbery.
In 1998 your economy fell, marking the end of mass rallies for great social justice or for the war in Chechnya.
Survival was a major concern.
Then Putin came along, young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to attack terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started comparing Chechnya again with the land, most of you closed your eyes.
I remember well those years.
I was then working in Chechnya to help the victims of the Putin "anti-Terrorist Operation," and I saw with my eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Jurty, Itum Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killing of children, the soldiers selling bodies to their families.
You said to me, "We're sick of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I said, "My friends, this isn't my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your power to bomb one of your cities, kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic recovery of the middle zero, driven by rising oil prices and the willingness of Putin to condone the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the middle-class pockets.
Many of you have made a good living, some have made a fortune, and even the poorest of you have purchased new housing and have found a better job.
Prices went up, wasn't it?
Moscow glistened and glistened with its head.
When a number of opponents were killed — Yuri Szczekochivina, Anna Politekowski, Alexander Litwinka and others — many of you were shocked and terrified about what was happening.
However, the matter was not going on.
When after two terms Putin transferred President Medvedev's office and took the prime minister's seat, I see you barely paid attention to it.
After several months of Medvedev Russia invaded Georgia, most of you either ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you have I met in the years to come on the mountain slopes of Gudaure, in the foothills of Kazbie, or in the cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we've hardly done much in the West if we've done anything at all.
A little resentment, some sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia’s flagrant violation of international law when the great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and domestic markets was so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the hard 1990s, it was the most important thing.
But at the end of 2011, you Russian friends woke up.
When Putin again changed seats with Medvedev and sat down with the president's chair as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you're mass protesting.
The name of Navali became family name, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt terrified that you were losing soil under your feet.
Then he struck back.
At first alternative actions were organized, and more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were imprisoned.
Some were given enormous terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Disturbed by the pro-Russian president, who had misled their European expectations, they once captured the Mayan – and never left him again.
They built a tent town on their own and prepared themselves for decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves by means of sticks, fittings, and Molotov cocktails.
The police finally opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters went into an attack.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitive was Yanuković, and the Ukrainians restored democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and to expel them if they were doing bad things.
Putin was greatly displeased by the Mayan.
That was a bad example.
So he took advantage of the general confusion and captured Crimea.
Some of you objected, but the benefits were limited.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91 percent of the citizens of Russia supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his chauffeur suddenly returned 180 degrees Fahrenheit [180 ° C] and began to adore it.
I find it hard to find a reason, since we stopped associating right after that.
The rest of my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding new ones in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, all the way new ones since the restoration, which was initiated by the mayor of Moscow in 2012, with their binbubs, popular waifs and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, wasn't there?
IDIL or something... even the Moscow editor who released my book about Syria criticized her in an interview, because I didn't understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I saw myself on Homs' streets shooting cold blood at my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia, there were only your soldiers who, in 2015, began to bomb thousands of civilians with experience for the next serious war.
Indeed, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came for socialists, but I said, "because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came for the union members, but I said no because I'm not a member of the union.
Then they came for the Jews, but I said no, because I'm not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense."
How many of you were talking about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority were silent.
Some people are really talking right now -- like Dimitro Glukovsky, Mikhail Schishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some people from the middle of the country, like Marina Osovnikov, risking entering a new Gulag or forming a company for Nabal.
In the case of others, you are best aware of the country you live in.
So I'm sure you realize that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians – or that seems very likely if he doesn't, he'll take care of you.
For all of you my friends, for those who were brave but who were mostly alone in protesting and who still had a very small time, but soon they'll get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreements on social networks (even in a black square in Instagram) or who spoke privately to colleagues at work.
At a time when 10 or 25 years of deprivation of liberty were given simply for anecdots, they were not in such a distant past – and now they are very likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you?
The example of the Ukrainians – even more than in 2014 – is frightening to the Putin regime: they prove that they can fight it.
And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop it, no matter how oppressive it may be.
In view of everything, few in Russia realize this, as does the fact that war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know exactly what's going on right now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you communicate.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence came to an end.
Your election is just a hahma, your laws, except for repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is gone, your economy is destroying faster than I am writing, you no longer have credit cards to buy air tickets abroad, even if there are any flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence; he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try or go or be crushed.
I doubt you're seeing something else.
Still, there's another one left.
Which will eventually overthrow this regime.
And maybe under the circumstances that you're made up of, you're going to need less than you think you're going to need.
Think about it.
It's not going to blow up from you, because of the economic collapse that's coming on Russia, it's most likely to burn in the provinces, in the small cities.
When the prices go down and the wages don't pay, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out on the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people a lot more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you my friends.
But if each city goes to a rally on its own, as it has happened on a periodic basis, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
We're going to need organization and coordination, and we're going to need to turn the crowd into mass.
You have this great magic tool, the Internet, which can be restricted, but which still works and which can be set up under almost any circumstances.
Now, the organization of the Navalve has been broken down, but other, more informal, more decentralized ones can be created.
There are a lot of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps a hundred thousand.
If you get more than 300,000, it's going to be amazing.
The army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to action?
After everything he made them go to Ukraine, what did he make them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will feel a sense of fear: but those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid if I were you.
In the case of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their host, who dare not only demand freedom but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, countless lives will still be lost in vain.
Your son will put a joke in the chat room of the computer game – and be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the Internet – and be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes – and die in the raw cell under police quirks.
Here's what's going on for many years -- and it's going to get bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know what's going to happen.
Act in a cold - blooded manner, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were on Friday night, they told us we could come on Monday.
We'll be home tonight.
That You Take Me as a Spokesperson
Vico, how often do you go to a expensive restaurant?
Once in a while, I go to dinner at an expensive restaurant.
I'll try to explain everything to her.
So we liked it very much and we wanted something bigger, so it's a better option.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people, and I got very tired of energy.
I don't feel well, cough, temperature, voice, weakness and head revolve
I have to go to that government of work.
We've done it before, but we told you who registered in April to get the money only at the end of the month.
We need a pass on Thursday, we're going to see the doctor with the kids.
But at night I wrote to a lady who liked your job, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm expecting new news from her, and I'm sure I'll report it.
While working in the Public Prosecutor's Office, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a complicated psychological, responsible, intellectual job in which I was completely disappointed.
I'm sorry for my time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but I take marriage issues seriously with one another.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died, a heart problem.
I think people have to love, respect, trust each other to make a family.
I haven't met that yet.
Good morning, where can you get uniforms in Yi-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Yi-Ja-Ki-Ki-Ki-Ki-Ki-Ki-i-i-i-
All right, thanks for the advice, I'm going to put a statement on the Vala's paper.
She's got a PCP in her bed, she's got a leg broken in the plaster, she's got a wheelchair in her bed, she's having all the food in her blender.
Mr. Reyhardd, I'm sorry I'm bothering you at work.
But I have an important question for you.
I went into a game room today in Natalie's room to say hello to her.
She had a bad situation.
Because when the kids went home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said she came to see things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our children's room until 7:00.
Can that really be the case?
The working time of the room is up to 4:00.
And finally, it's our responsibility.
But I don't have a load to open a page with a very weak Internet.
Cola's working well, she's filling out invitations yesterday, and I've been with the elders before I went to gym school.
It's hard to figure out how to do this in geometry.
On Saturday Vladimir helped us.
Vica studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We Thank You very much for Our Homes
Yeah, but I thought you weren't filling up.
