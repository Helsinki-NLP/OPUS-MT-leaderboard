A 28-year-old cook found dead at the San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old cook, who had recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a ladder flight by a local shopping centre this week.
However, the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, saying, "He's got things going right."
- The body found in Westfield Mole on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galisia, reported to the San Francisco Forensics Bureau.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that death has been classified as murder and investigation continues.
The victim's brother, Luis Galisia, told the ABC radio channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, a past delivery line cook in Boston, was given his job as a cook at San Francisco's Sons & Daghters restaurant six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daghters said that they were “scraped and oppressed” by his death.
"We are a small team that works as a friendly family and will miss him very much," said the representative.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Louis Galisia said that Frank had stopped at the hostels first, but recently, "He's been doing some sort of work."
"He found an apartment, he dated a girl," Louis Galicia said to KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a great heart.
His way of communicating with his family has always been to make us some food, make us dinner," Louis Galisia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of fight.
He was a brother who was floating through the river.
"With all the bad things that are happening to this world, it was the limitless diamond that was shining brightly every day," he said.
All those with information are asked to call the SFPD Hotline at 415-575-4444.
Churkin said that the UN Sowebes meeting on Crimea was useful.
The Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, stated that the last meeting of the Security Council on Crimea had been useful and referred to Interfax.

He explained that, in closed consultations, he had provided Member States with information on incidents in the territory of the Republic of Crimea and had read out a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation expressing concern and indignation at the attempt to terrorize and sabotage the territory of the Republic of Crimea.

Italy’s Dome has grown to record levels
In June 2016, the Italian State was over Euro2.248 trillion.
At the central bank, countries stated that this amount was a historic maximum, passing on the RIA News.
The previous negative record was established in May of this year.
At that time, the public debt reached Euro2.228 trillion.
It is noted that Italy ' s debt burden increased by Euro77.2 billion during the first half of the year.
It had previously been reported that at the end of 2015, Italy ' s state debt represented 132.7 per cent of the country ' s GDP.
Meanwhile, the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Pierre Carlo Padoan, projected a decrease of 130.9 per cent in 2016 and 123.4 per cent of GDP in 2018.

Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
The international group of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived spinal animal is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, passes RT.
Scientists conducted a radio - carbon analysis of the crystalline eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, with a length of more than five feet [5 m], may be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolicism plays an important role in the shark’s longevity, which leads to slow development.
Female sharks of Greenland reach puberty only by the age of 150.
Previously, it was thought that the longer all vertebrate animals lived on the shark's neighbour, the Greenland whale.
The oldest person known to the scientist was just over 210 years of age.
Putin has changed the composition of the Sowbez of the Russian Federation.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, by decree, amended the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation and informed the Kremlin press service.
Earlier, it had become known that Putin had removed President Sergei Ivanov as head of administration, and Anton Vaino had been appointed his successor.
Ivanov will now serve as Special Representative of the President for Environment, Environment and Transport.
Among the permanent members of the Russian Federation, Rashid Nurgaliev, the Council's Deputy, was removed.
It includes Sergey Ivanov, Anton Vaino, half to the President of the FNL, Sergei Menilo, and half to the FNL, Nicolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov has been released from office as President's Chief of Administration.
By decree of President Sergei Ivanov, he was released from the position of Head of the Kremlin Administration.
Ivanov has been appointed Special Representative of the Russian Federation for Environmental Affairs, Environment and Transport.
Anton Vaino, former deputy of Sergei Ivanov, was appointed the new head of administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked for another job.
Should I go to a sanatorium if there is no health problem?
Our expert is the chief doctor at Olga Bohus Sanatorium.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of his job, should he go to a sanatorium?
Sanatorium rest is needed not only for treatment but also for disease prevention.
In a sanatorium, a person can check his or her condition and receive a doctor’s advice on how to live so that his or her health will not be damaged.
Such recommendations would not be superfluous.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, and you don't want to miss it.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is about 90 percent of those who come.
The most vulnerable are people from large cities between 45 and 55 years of age.
So it's better not to make things difficult and let yourself rest on time.
Studies have shown that 98 per cent of people are declining their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable recreation for the whole family.
So if you want to have a holiday with your kids, you won't have to break up with them.
Children, even the youngest, have health programmes that include both diagnostic services, paediatrics, analyses and treatments.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are child basins), inhalation, special feeding conditions, massages, oxygen cocktails, therapeutic exercise.
The procedure defines the doctor according to individual evidence and the characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, sanatoriums tend to operate a children ' s club with animators, where children can attend play classes and various master classes.
Some sanatoriums even open their doors to visitors with babies, provide breastfeeding facilities and provide services to an experienced babysitter.
A soft winter, a long summer, and an abundance of sundays per year (over 300) create good conditions for year-long rest on Caucasian Mineral Water resorts.
And then the body doesn't just need rest in summer.
So there is no need to be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for those of advanced age.
Of course, the main focus of the Caucasian Mineral Waters region is the treatmental mineral sources: Slavanovsky, Smyrnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect various systems of the body.
The water varies by temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical composition and gas composition.
The doctor picks up water depending on the patient's feelings.
Narzan, for example, has an inflammatory, immuno-immunodicative effect that restores the gastrointestinal tract and the exchange of substances.
The Essentuci-4 affects the stomach and bowel tract, lowers sugar levels.
The “Essentuci New” has an inflammatory, yellow and urinary effect.
The same effects are shared by the waters of Slavanovskaya.
In the assignment of water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there's signs of hypertension, it picks up less salty water because salts keep the fluid, which leads to higher pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, at the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are now available in sanatoriums.
What types of recovery based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus are available on the resorts of the region?
Near Pygorsk, for example, is a salty lake called Tambukan, which is used for joints, spines, and internal organs.
It has an inflammatory, disclosing, immune effect.
These are health walks along individually designed routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Kurt Park, the second largest park in Europe.
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the mineral source Narzan.
You can also take baths of wine, pearly, yogurt, spleen, scaffolding, depending on what you're going to get.
We're going to have more fertility.
What can you do to keep the harvest going until the end of the season?
Tells Julia Belopuchov, agroman and a Danish woman.
It's time for the tall tomato to have a haircut: take off the new pastures, cut the puppies, remove all the leaves before the last one, with the fruit and with the small curtains of well-being, they will not ripen.
All tomatoes, independently of the “constitution”, and peppers and eggplants, shall be fed with silica, biopreparatophosphosphate, bio-preparatics (Survivor - for the acceleration of the flow and growth of the fruit, Phitosporin-M, Phytosporin-M, Hamir, Bactofit - for disease, Immunocytophyte - for the enhancement of immunity, Bytoxicibicillin, Lepidicide, Pytoverm - if there are any pests).
From the chemicals at the end of summer, we should use only copper cassava, colloid sulphur, and green soap.
We're making the last crop of plants.
The long-plaster cucumbers in the greenhouse heater shall be lowered from the wallpaper so that the lower, nude part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, watered with warm water and the solution of the Circon, and placed 5-7 cm of compost.
It is also easy to extend the papaya’s fertility by cutting down the old leaves, pouring hot water and a solution to integrated fertilizing, and putting the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against nighttime colds, set an arc superimposed with cover material above the row.
Keep plants open by day, and close by after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s withdrawal from the longest recession in the last 20 years.
The GDP of the Russian Federation has shown a positive trend, as reported by the Bloomberg Agency, when GDP fell by 0.8 per cent in annual terms in the second quarter of GDP.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the Russian economy slowed down to 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The stabilization of the situation has also recently been announced by the Central Bank and Minaconomation.
The front is slow growth.
According to experts from the CBI, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
"The Russian GDP index estimates indicate that the recession remains behind, and the economic growth ahead is slow," says a bulletin of the Bank of Russia entitled "What the Trends Say."
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter of regulators increased to 0.4 per cent and the estimate for the fourth quarter was 0.5 per cent.
As reported by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the fall of GDP in the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter at 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared decline in GDP was 0.2 per cent by the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the recession stopped: in April, it was 0.2 per cent and in May and June, the change in GDP was between 0 and 0.15” and quoted the representative of IREA as “News”.
The slowing down of the Russian economy during the last five blocks indicates that “the bottom has been reached”.
Among other markers indicating signs of national economic recovery, Bloomberg refers to increased demand for electricity and rail transport and business recovery.
If an adjustment was made to the fact that the year was high, it was clear that the trend in plus 1% of electricity consumption could be due to an additional working day.
Add a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is an increase in freight transport, but it's difficult to get accurate data here, and a plus-minus 0.5 per cent of semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality,” explains Kirill Jacobenko from ALOR BRACK.
However, there are other more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressures.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared to 15.6 per cent last month.
Moreover, Rosstat has been recording deflation for the last two weeks.
Prices in Russia have dropped for the first time in five years.
If you look at the course of the ruble, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has grown by 12 per cent since the beginning of the year since August.
It's also one of the signs of recovery, followed by indicators from the real economy," Jakovanko points out.
In addition, the Russian Federation has seen an increase in industrial production since April.
The figure increased by 1.7 per cent in June.
Foreign trade has slowed from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
A positive trend is also evident in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4 per cent.
It was only below in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the good situation in the labour market, the issue of real incomes available to the population left much to be desired.
In annual terms, the figure falls by 4.8 per cent.
This can hinder economic recovery, as household expenditures make a significant contribution to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the firm policy of the Bank of Russia is also a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator retains a rate of 10.5%, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
The poor level of investment is also a negative factor, which hinders the development of industrial capacity.
But, in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the economy of the Russian Federation will have slowed down to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015,” says an analyst at the CD Force Club, Irina Rogova.
The naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well established in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not developed so actively in summer sports.
If the Rio Olympics are for Russia and former foreigners, in most cases they are natives of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
At the same time, in Rio de Janeiro, we can see the reverse process - quite a large number of Russians are flying the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality varies.
Someone's parents were taken to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone couldn't stand the competition for a place in a Russian prefabricated.
And some thought that there would be better conditions for development in sport abroad.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
A German passport of a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But she used to be Elizabeth, of course.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Only four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow her older sister's footsteps - to pursue a slight athletic.
Like my sister, Lisa chose 6th jumps.
She's staying in Russia, and she wouldn't be able to move Helen Isinbaev off the throne.
Unfortunately, on the Rio Olympiad, Lisa will be our only landr, albeit former, in the 6th jumps sector.
Its best achievements in this form of sport are the bronze of the 2010 European championship and the silver of continental primacy in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaev.
Elena Pirovkova, 29 years old, was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelists.
Because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
Besides Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started fighting back in school.
Showing good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued her studies under the leadership of another former Russianman, Vladislav Slayer.
On the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first fight.
But at the world championship the same year, there's a victory.
Prior to that, she had won the world’s first silver harvest in 2010.
This was followed by bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavla, where she first learned to swim in synchronism.
But it would be wrong to say that she was raised by our Russian coaches.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
Soon she was entering the United States and was showing excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronizers are unable to compete, but for America its performance is a ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Christine Chaldibina when her parents decided to continue the education of a girl with artistic gymnastics beyond the ocean.
Up to this point, the girl was engaged in a favorite sport in her native Yaroslavla.
When she emigrated to the United States, she quickly joined a young group in that country and later entered the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Cristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she didn't have to fight, but for the United States, she made a real breakthrough -- she brought out a star-slum assembly at the Rio Games.
Another of our former artist is Jan Berezko Marggrader, who is in favour of Germany's gathering.
She was born in Tolitti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects for joining the national assembly.
Soon she was representing her country at the 2012 London Olympics.
True, she was able to occupy only 17 places that were not enough to get into the final competitions in her personal first year.
But two years earlier, she had won the bronze medal of the Olympics -- a young man.
Another gymnast, only this time the sportsman is Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigrating the previously mentioned athletes can be described as standard, the choice of the Irina family is very unusual — Iceland.
Ira's a student at the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland she immediately became a champion of the country.
True, Ira is still trained in Russia - she makes a special visit to her country so that she does not lose her skills.
In Rio, she did not speak as well as she would have liked.
The best place is 40 in a private maze.
There's very little evidence of Mary Ooglokov's swimming in the Russian information area.
For a very long time, Maria has lived and been trained in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it had been flying the Russian flag, showing good results — even the country ' s record of 200 metres of Butterflück.
In 2015, she obtained Swiss citizenship and began to act under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in the complex 4x100.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, which allowed her to collect some 6,000 francs to pay for her training for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter named Adam Battrov spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
During this period, Hasawurt was able to become the three-time champion of European championships, the champion of Russia, and the master sport of the international class of Russia.
When he stopped getting into our national assembly, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports posts.
A triumphal return took place at the Asian championship in 2016 - Bativ had already represented Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and was on his way to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Koonnova, is even less well known in her homeland than even the Swiss seamen Maria Ugolkova.
The point is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to engage in sports gymnastics.
It has not achieved much at the international level.
In Rio, the best result was 40th in qualifications on parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting into the Olympics in sports gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her training in synchronized navigation, showing good results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European championship in Berlin, the girl took the sixth place in synchronized navigation.
In a duet with Eugenia, Thetelbaum Anastasia was ranked eighth.
It was the fifth in the salt program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dimitri Croiter is in favour of Israel's gathering.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, Dimitri became a champion of the country by the age of 17.
That same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croyter also wins the gold of the young Olympics in Singapore.
In addition to leaps to height, Dimitri takes care of the jumps in length and three jumps.
Albert is another native of Hasawurt, 31 years old, who, after a long speech for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
Unlike Batyrov, however, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, however, he promoted the Krasnojarsk High Sports School, even becoming a champion of the country in 2011.
Oleg Antonov, who was 28 years old, was born in Moscow as a family player of the U.S.S.A. volleyball, Yaroslav Antonov.
Just one year before the birth of Yaroslav, he was considered the world’s best volleyballist.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
There, the family remained permanently resident.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became a bronze champion of the European championship in his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and joined his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, my parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was the first target, but it was not possible to enter that northern country - it had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to study the free struggle.
Soon he won the primacy of peace among his peers, and later he was qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio he will be France's only representative in the competition tournament.
Once again, a free struggle, and again, a former Russian.
This time we're talking about a North Ossetian who emigrated to Spain, the Times of Freeway.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is currently in favour of the national team.
Until then, the 30-year-old athlete had been able to show off on record in Russia as well.
He became a bronze champion of the 2007 and 2008 championships.
The charter of non-invasion into assembly, Timemuraz decided to replace sports citizenship.
The last on our list is the Chechen boxer born in 1995 in the capital city of Dagestan Mahachale, Arthur Biarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur began boxing on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has been a champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became a world champion among young people.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan-American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, having a son.
Why the kids in the classrooms?
According to Governor V. Condratyev, “it is said that they should be brought up in a systematic manner rather than by actions and parades”.
They have to grow, and from at least seven years of age, they have to understand that they're cassavas and education.
But for the time being, I think this work is being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
I'll be happy if the kazooka classes absorb all the positive things that have been accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level.
If everyone's drunk and we don't know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
The MCC remains one of the most criminal sectors of the country ' s economy.
There is an abuser of funds allocated to the public sector from different budgets.
According to the Office of the Attorney-General, over-pricing is one of the most common crimes in the area of the CCS.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid more than 170 million roubles for energy.
In recent days, the Prosecutor ' s Office of the Krasnodar Province has identified the inclusion of unreasonable costs in tariffs.
A total of 4 million roubles have been charged to the cost of OIA-Consulting (which provides cold water) for the rental of vehicles at a higher price than the market.
And there are a lot of such examples across the country.
The people pay the latest money for the “community” and pay well, according to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, 94 per cent of the population's average collection rate.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: waste, legalization of proceeds of crime, abuse of power, etc.
According to the case file, as head of the fund working on the renovation of urban facilities, Makarov entered into contracts with entrepreneurs, not actually working on them, but paid for.
Businessmen just gave him most of the money.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers didn't pay and spent it on their own.
As a result, the budget and the inhabitants are affected by millions of rubles.
Macarov's scheme is typical of Russia.
There has been a wave of arrests and detentions of U.S. leaders, who have paid for the money of the citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan, by the way, is ongoing, and is also being charged with 91.7 million roubles.
In the 2012-2013 version of the investigation, he set up 6 companies in Elisevo Kamchatsk province and established 3 limited-responsibility societies.
One of them carried out contractual work for the CC, and the other two played the role of cash centres, which meant that they accepted money from the population.
But by energy A. Cohan didn't transfer money but spent it on himself, his loved one.
It's difficult to deal with LHCs.
Cases don't get excited, they're delayed.
And “helps” in this extremely confused housing law, says Svetlana Rodzorkova, executive director of the NP, “GACC Control”.
We don't have time to make the same law as we do the new one, which has to make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, on the issues of the MCCs.
Lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to housing law in universities.
Non-prosecution of criminal proceedings is also reported in the Office of the Attorney-General.
Of the 3.5 thousand crimes that are being prosecuted in 2015, less than half of them are in court.
The remainder of the investigation has been prolonged and 1 in 5 has been suspended owing to a lack of identification of the accused.
The shortcomings in law enforcement agencies are often described by them as gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the investigative authorities are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were some 230 reports of counterfeiting, with only 60 criminal cases initiated.
In the course of the five months of the current year, the number has increased only slightly - 99.
What, though, is the falsification of the residence protocol?
This means that the change in home administration, financial and other matters bypass the opinions of owners.
This also means that the housing and utilities market cannot be entered by normal companies that want to work honestly rather than “salvation” the population.
It turns out the tenants are in the mini, small and medium-sized businesses, too.
First of all, through the eradication of corruption as such throughout the State, Anton Zharkov, a member of the Property Committee.
This work is now under way.
This is not just a single action; it is an anti-corruption focus.
Of course, this is not the sad situation in all regions.
In particular, there are no scandals in the capital.
Why are there no such scandals in Moscow in the area of CCS as in many other regions?
Because the Metropolitan Government has shown iron will and order, says AIF Anatoly Electoral, member of the Committee of State on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I refer to both the personnel issue and the legislative amendments and legal education.
Managers have been closely monitored and all have been licensed.
Complaints from citizens are promptly resolved in public space (and from residents, and responses are posted on the Moscow Government portal).
Many not only pay their monthly receipts but closely follow what is written about the house.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource- and management organizations is very high.
The Moscow Plus verifys the validity of the tariffs on housing and utilities, since a large part of the budget is allocated to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Perhaps this together explains the calm conditions in Moscow.
Is it possible that everything is rooted in the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe it's worth changing jobs.

Will Erdogan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Reggie Tayip Erdogan, put forward an ultimatum for a choice between Turkey and Fechullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d ' état.
He said so when speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to refuse support for the “Fehullahist terrorist organization”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States is called upon to change its position.
The experts believe that the division between Turkey and the West is increasing and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“Early or later, America will choose between Turkey and FETO.
Either organizing a coup d'état of FETO or democratic Turkey.
It should make this choice," quotes the Anatolyan Agency of Erdogan's address on Wednesday night in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once more demanded that the United States comply with his demand for the first time since the rebellion was suppressed.
We will recall that on the night of 16 July in Turkey, high-level Turkish army officials attempted to overthrow legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt against the life of the head of State.
However, after Reggie Erdogan addressed the population, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
A total of some 8,000 people were suspected, including teachers and scientists besides the military.
According to Reggie Erdogan, they were mentored by Fechullah Gülen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
Herdogan’s supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the coup.
The Panel recommends no award of compensation in respect of the amount of USD 260,000.
The last statement by the representatives of the State Department in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan ' s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey, he insists on his own and he also demands other Western partners.
“Ancar will cease to fulfil his obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not set a date for the lifting of the visa restrictions on Turkish nationals”, said the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Chelik, on 9 August.
He said that Ankara ' s amendment of the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe ' s own security.
Note that on 1 August, German vice-cancellor Ziegmar Gabriel asked Turkey to stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open the borders to migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were in response to a statement by the Head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevlut Tchavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu made on the past Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The Head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not rule out the possibility of a withdrawal from the alliance if he did not receive the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence field is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign States in the defence sector - importing missiles,” Chavushoglu stated to Andolu in an interview.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system based on its technology and to cooperate with other countries.
“Turkish has so far tried to cooperate with NATO countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have been looking for others,” said the Minister.
The experts believe that all of this is indicative of Turkey ' s serious differences with the West and the country ' s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Assessment, Eugenius Minchenko, believes that Reggie Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go into a brutal confrontation with the West.
He has a lot to do with the West both from the business point of view and from the military point of view (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining a framework with the West.
Although, of course, the Americans would be more comfortable to see a fully obedient person in this position,” Aif.ru explained.
He said that it was possible, after the statements of the Turkish leader (the non-payment of EU compensation, the demand for a non-visitable space with Europe and the extradition of Gülen from the United States) he would be pressured.
“Rejép Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will pressure him on humanitarian issues, on dictatorial management practices of the country and so forth,” Minchenko says.
The Head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, admits that the President of Turkey is changing his views in his relations with Russia as soon as it benefits him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very strict stand against Russia and sought favor in the West by all means.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that, after some time, the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdogan entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
When he is between the two poles of the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself,” Muhin believes.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today was to retain political power in the country, which was precisely why he needed Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin so that the United States could stop supporting Gülen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
A consensus will therefore be reached with Turkey”, the expert believes.
The head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glasov, takes a different view.
The relations between Turkey and the EU and the United States are now quite tense, and this is primarily linked to the domestic policy that Erdogan personally has.
I think that this crisis will be exacerbated in relations and, against this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to overload policies in both the Middle East and Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, are willing to change their position on a number of Syrian issues, have settled relations with Israel, and are actively engaging with Iran,” explained Aif.ru Glasov, allowing Erdogan's next move to normalize relations with Egypt.
She said that the policy now pursued by Erdogan was to return to the course of the foreign political concept followed by Turkey before the Arab revolutions.
Turkey then began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
The President of Turkey has now made very good visits to Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and strengthen Turkey's position in both the regional and international arenas,” the expert believes.
The Glasgow believes that returning Turkey to its previous relations with the EU would be extremely difficult, but now the question is whether the EU will respond rigidly to Turkey, which could open borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Call for new collective protests
The junior doctors asked the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new contract of employment.
The JDC of the British Medical Association (BMA) is about to request its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC said the ministers were unable to answer questions about the employment contract.
The junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the contract of employment agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members voting in secret ballots.
In a letter to members published on Twitter Thursday evening, JDC Chairman Ellen McCort said that the Government had continued “to remain silent” about the problems she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: “In view of the prevailing situation, JDC's leader voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiation on all your matters.”
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC leader today made a formal request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuous programme of expansion of collective protests since early September.
The dispute led to the participation of young doctors in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the Public Health Service.
Dr. Joan Malawana, head of BMA junior doctors, resigned after voting for the cancellation of the agreed contract of employment, which BMA recommended.
He told the BMA members that the deal was a good one to be made during the meetings in anticipation of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunte, said that this employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alians bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague to a gold palace in St. Petersburg, I had the strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked tense, and he barely emitted heat, even according to his own self-restraint standards.
In contrast, Regge Taip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his “precious friend” Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I've lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even to a higher level.
The following day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the prolonged cold from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first reason for the crisis was mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was illogical.
Mr. Putin was angry with the tyrad, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger on the basis of an alleged friend.
Restoration of real confidence will probably not be possible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, State-controlled media carried out a shocking, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be held guilty of everything.
The most serious allegations were that Mr. Erdogan ' s own family had resorted to illegal oil trafficking from Syrian areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it firmly.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, the meeting was only because Mr. Putin had received the apology he had asked President Erdogan to apologize.
Russia could have claimed to win a kind of victory.
The benefits of the armistice announcement are clear to Ankara.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost dethroned last month in an attempt at a coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey must have shocked him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
The Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the charter ban, which usually brings several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has dropped dramatically by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, the tour operators and charter companies here will of course feel relieved when the flights finally resume.
They peak the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in a report in the Vedomesty newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ancar's evil in the West because she thinks it's a weak answer to the coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged discontent to the turtle’s pace of talking about joining the EU and Mr. Putin’s step — which seeks to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy the Turkish ties to the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support from elected authorities following an attempted coup d ' état.
Remember, this is a tribute to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So the summit at this brilliant palace on the coast of the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described me as “bad: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
Despite the public display of reconciliation, however, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently stood as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
Perhaps it is for itself that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two Presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even touch on the subject.
The President of Turkey had deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin had chosen to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language for Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and taking into account the possibility of a total disaster when a NATO member of Turkey hit a Russian jet fighter — it is certainly better that two leaders speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
The RBS is to be reduced to the role of a bec-office, according to the bank executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC of Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has retreated since it almost collapsed eight years ago and needed to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used RBS to protect other brands of consumer credit.
He was supported by millions of pounds of sponsoring support for international sport, from the Gregby Cup of six nations to the Wimbledon Andy Murray championship.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already being used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will gain greater influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brand RBS will eventually become our investment brand and our staff's occupation, because we're now more of a brand bank."
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I am now saying that we no longer have global aspirations; we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not be possible to continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building up a profile of various brands in sponsoring sports.
"This is an appropriate time for us to move a brand bank, because at the core of (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the customer bank?" said the executive director.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we were going to be an excellent bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've done, focusing on the needs of customers, not on our own, I think you've seen a lot of change.
We can get these brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners in New Market in the Pacific.
The detectors spraying champagne after a double in New Market brings it to 3,000 wins.
Jokey Frankie Dietori won his 3,000th British victory in New Market on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track, the Passion, trained by John Godden.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey and has reached this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Edderi and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion of the Zakee Detective, who had won the ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm really excited because my family's here too.
I'm really glad this happened in New Market, because it's where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event; it's not a Royal Agust -- it's a regular Friday night with 2,000 people.
I'm free of business and I'm very untapped.
The detectors receive applause when they bring out a precipice after the victory.
Two of the jockeys reached this mark with obstacles: the champion Richard Johnson and the retired 20-year-old champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins for his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern world, and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark that so few have reached before him.
He's a kind and strong man, but it's his tactical snitch that makes him different from others in the weight room.
He's a great jumper, his enthusiasm and charisma have been attracting fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Eps he would have brought 6,000 winners if he hadn't been just a jockey for the weekend and a big jump!
And seriously, Frankie's been bringing winners to Britain for the most part of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a vigorous character that's good for British jumps, but he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a brand-new fast-tracked horse nipple.
From the rapid finish line to the rapid nipple, Frankie Datori is a symbol of British smooth leaps for two decades.
It was take-off and fall.
Many of the winners of the great leaps, including his famous Great Seven in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified because of doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualifying, but he showed great will to challenge skeptics and return to his uniform.
And he may not have finished for a while -- the detectives have said before that they would like to continue participating in the competitions, at least until he is 50 years old.
Putin dismisss Sergey Ivanov, Chief of Administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivan has been part of Putin's trusted neighborhood for many years.
The 63-year-old was now appointed environmental and transport representative.
A statement from the Kremlin states that Putin “decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President” but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy, Anton Waino, has been appointed his successor since 2012.
Mr. Vaino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in Estonia’s capital, Tallinn, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later the head of the protocol of the President and the Government apparatus, reporting to the Kremlin website (in Russian).
At his appointment he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your work as Head of State in drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being followed.
Putin told a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his removal from office and had recommended that Vaino replace him.
Do smiles convince you?
It's a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin ' s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on State television, both men stated that the Chief of Administration had resigned on his own.
Despite the smiles of the camera, this has convinced few here — especially now — just before the parliamentary elections.
So, this is the unintended consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that the man who was once advocated for being a potential president suddenly wanted to govern Russian environmental policy — was met with tremendous skepticism.
In Putin's comments, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It's true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to talk to me about this very difficult position, even, you could say, a difficult post, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was president of the President's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as was Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced KGB, Ivan was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could have become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since the third term for Putin would have been contrary to the Constitution.
However, another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, occupied the post.
Putin became Prime Minister before his return to the presidency three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson is fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was a party to the filming in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studies and CBS Television Studies, which produce serials, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences in filming and differences of opinion.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be removed from the show, which monitors the FBI agent team, is expected to come later, according to ABC Studies and CBS Television Studies.
A 54-year-old actor who had played the leading role in the Sitcom of Darma and Greg has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I've loved to think as a criminal and put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of my life, but now it's not possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team, and, above all, the best fans the show could only dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
The problem: The fish landed in the garden of Banffa
A man from Banf sought help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish may have been sands left behind by a water tornado.
Bane, 500 meters from the sea, put a picture of this in Periscope, hoping someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The Bridge is now connected to Fife
Project 1.35 billion pounds is now due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern overflight and the viaduct of Queensferry Crossing, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It's the first of the four circuits between the "weirs of the canvas" that are now approaching completion near all three of the bridge's pilots.
The Fife Bridge Section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vants of bridge.
The $1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The economic minister, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnesses to engineering art that's truly epic in this project, where over 30,000 tons of concrete were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the collision between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtuoso operation using extremely precise assembly tolerances.
A total of about 79% of the bridge canvas is now in place, and for the last section of the canvas, the concrete is released today in Rosate, which means that the entire canvas is ready to go up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Fort Crossing Bridge Project, said, "The first collision on each project bridge is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this contiguity is the most modern construction art.
With the installation of the last section of the road canvas and the connection of it to the expanding North pilot road canvas, we were left to close the remaining gap on the northern side — or toward the shore — on the north side.
This was done by extending the North Approach to 700 millimetres south.
It was a large - scale, yet very elaborate, operation.
Large-scale, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and should have been raised to an angle of about 3%.
Fine because the tolerances the team was working on were tiny — just a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, all of this went very well.
Salvation in the Gulf of Moelfrey: Three men are lucky to be alive.
Three men were lucky to be alive after being thrown off a fishing ship in England.
The Molfre RNLI rescue station raised alarm at 13.20 British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in the Moalfr Bay.
Three men tried their best to get to safety while their ship continued on its way.
"We've seen their ship orbit around them and suggest the worst," said the lifeboat of the Melfres Vince Jones.
"Unhappily, by the time we got down onto the water, a strong wind had driven him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and a third man, 60 years old, was found exhausted and stuck in a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all taken aboard the shore lifeboat and taken to the rescue station
Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
There was an emergency breaker in the engine of the boat, but he somehow pulled off the man driving the boat when it woke up.
Somebody's been picking these guys up today.
Pokémon Go, worthy for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that adolescents and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time watching the screens, has been a complaint by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages them in some physical activity.
Time on the screen was originally limited to television, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
It's so great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to the full engagement of Pokémon Go, an annex based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (the resulting series of cartoons, play cards and other branches).
Like many other pop cultural phenomena, all of this has become obsolete earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at that time was delayed owing to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
The number of days Pokémon Go had more users than Finder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a word, smartphone players are going to look for Pokemons that are tracked on GPS and that can be 'photos' (through a box on your phone) or 'rapped.'
A generation who played the game while younger joined in a vortex of passion, cutting away from the couches to look for.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the “normal” person every day.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch application that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported that within two days of the game, the number of people being tracked, who performed 30-minute exercises every day, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on levels.
Many health-care campaigns that convince people to find 30 minutes, get up from the couch and be active every day have not been answered, because most health-care messages are boring and are spoken by people who seem to be unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who regularly exercise reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high arterial pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she pushes people out to do what they love.
Thus, three basics of health are covered: traffic, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends hunting.
As usual, there are boring nuns looking for what they want.
And yes, someone might bump into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Because even though smartphone applications like Fitbit could keep track of our physical activity, they didn't give us any reason for studying like this game does.
The news says, and use will weaken over time.
But the success of the Pokemon will result in more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simon Byls wins the gold of absolute superiority in female gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the fuss.
Simon Byls is incontrovertible for all of this.
Dynamic on the back of the jump.
Unforced in a log.
Stunned on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic championship.
A 19-year-old American gymnasium rose to the title of the absolute primacy champion on Thursday, placing the gap between itself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under the close attention of the Olympics.
Her total score was 6.2.198 at a reasonable distance from the silver medalist and friend of the final five team, Ali Riceman, and the Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafina.
Byls, from the United States, stands on a gymnastic log during the final of the female individual absolute mastership in artistic gymnastics for 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byls became the fourth consecutive American woman who won the title of the champion of absolute primacy and the fifth in general, maintaining her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps at any time.
She was sobbing when she showed her the final general score and her long journey by that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as extremely rare athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Byls has spent the last three years dominating his sport, winning 15 medals of the world championship - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing programs in their mixture of work and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Ratton called her “the greatest gymnast I have ever seen”.
One last test was in Brazil, the competition was not so much between Bails and others in this area as it was between her and the cargo of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an impossible expectation.
Simon Byls, from the United States, on the left, and Ali Rysman, embrace after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the finale of female individual absolute primacy in artistic gymnastics at the Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Byls earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of the retired coordinator of the national congregated Martha Caroline.
While Bilas insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the summit, it wasn't exactly that way.
Part of her free training program — the one that includes her firm passage — is set up for Latin - American music, which would fit directly into the streets outside the Olympic Arena of Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandfather and grandmother, who began walking as a child and who had been opened by coach Amy Burman’s mother during her visit to the gym room, where Burman was a trainer, became a force.
It has not lost any competition in absolute priority since the summer of 2013 — a belt of luck that must continue for as long as Bails wishes.
Although Mustafina gained a small advantage by means of two spins, it was a mirage.
Hymnastic log and free exercise — where Bails defends the title of the world champion — is ambushed.
She went forward again with 15.433 in the log and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
The Riceman hugged her as they waited for the final account -- the pure formality -- and tears appeared around the brilliant red and blue eyebrows of Bilas when the scheme she had once written in the cut-off album came true.
Riceman's speech was a little vindictive for four years ago when she was dividing third place, but she lost Mustafina's bronze on a tai-breath.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that Americans call "Grandmother" was a long way ahead.
She sent out a crowd of kisses after her free exercise, covered by return, which at times seemed to be in question.
In the case of Byls, a 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week is now quite new:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the most deadly attack of the first serial killer of Phoenix in the last decade sat in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot dead, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Lyner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the carriageway, the authorities stated.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots from the gun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then hiding on the other vehicle, as reported in the report.
The police claim that the three-way murder does not appear to be the result of a robbery, since the perpetrator did not take the wallet or $2,900 that was at the disposal of an adult victim.
Agent Jonathan Howard, a member of the Phoenix police, stated that the shooting had prompted the investigators to check if he had been involved in the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others were injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"It's happening in the residential area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, branch of CBS, early this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including brown Nissan at the end of the 1990s, black BMW at the end of the 1990s, and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, aged 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter, Malia, were killed.
The Witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shelling, which was intended to be an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-year murder and which is believed to have been the case of a serial killer.
The investigators found the branches and removed the bullet from the seat and fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
A mother of a six-year-old child with a microcephalia: "It's getting better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixito likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund’s microcephalia is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Piccito, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for it.
Which, in fact, isn't true -- of course you sign up for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested placing him in a specialized hospital.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing it," Piccito explained.
Edmund walks with walkers.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But it's slow going through some of the stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and sings.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund made to "please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," said Piccito CBS News.
But more than just a common sign language, she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalia may arise from a number of different circumstances: genetic infections, such as Edmund, during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zica.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those living with the Zik virus.
Piscito remembers the emotional loss because of the uncertain future.
Did I always say what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifelong forecast, because I don't really expect anyone to be able to tell me.
But Pixcito has some encouraging advice for mothers of children with congenital defects because of Zik.
It's getting better.
You know everything will be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding is the cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state until Saturday.
Numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and south Mississippi have come out of the coast and threaten large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, reports the National Meteorological Service.
Governor Louisiana John Bell Edwards stated that government officials were in constant contact with the local authorities and that the assistance had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that there were requests for transportation for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steve said that it was the arrival of Tangjipahoa that invited tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The risk of flooding remains valid until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
The Metropolitan Service said in a statement that an extra 3 to 5 inches could float into the area.
In southern Alabama, the call was pending until Friday, as it continued to rain in the Mobil area.
The Komit River next to Baton Ruz and the Amit River next to Dan Springs, both in Louisiana, were supposed to record the level of the flood last weekend.
Synoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Ruja.
He also said that the flooding that was going down the Assensensean apparition was a threat, as these rising rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9:00 a.m. on Friday.
The rescuers were still taking people out of the floods in Amit and Wilkinson County in the southwest state of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and pasta were among those saved early on Friday at Gloucester's.
Hansford, 62 years of age, says that the Bever Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said that another pasture that lived nearby had warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept coming," said Hansford.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that this was the biggest tributary she's ever seen in 48 years who lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family had a disability, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the rescue workers saved all three by means of an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they took refuge on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is “swiftly spreading” as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain falling from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil had been filled with rainfall from the Wednesday.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets have resulted in the rescue of residents from homes in the parish of Tangjipahoa and the abolition of classes in five school districts, the authorities claim.
WWL, a branch of CBS, reports that the adviser, Tangjipahoa, spoke about 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they're both sinking now.
Robbie Miller's president stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets in high water.
The shelters were opened in Amit and Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
"They'll have an opportunity to go home as soon as the water starts to retreat," he said.
In the city of Hammond, about two dozen streets were closed because of high levels of water, and bags of sand were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacey Landram, city manager.
This is on the way to a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, Rupert Lacey, the head of the Emergency Service, reported that it continued to rain on the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses had been registered as being flooded on Thursday, but none had been registered on Friday.
Kate Tousson, head of the Hopper Value Foods store in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Tausson, "and she's still on the ground."
Mahage Brown, 6, “separated by bullets”, remains alive after shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shot at 6-year-olds in town this week.
His grandmother and grandfather identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandma and Grandpa are told that Brown received numerous gunshot wounds, including his scent, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious of being taken to the hospital.
"He had a lot of trouble, his little body was lined up with bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez of the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in a critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade in a local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the Germantown district.
Three men were also shot, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men was in critical condition; the other two victims were registered in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting to the station.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been shot.
Investigators report CBS Philadelphia, which appears to have been a exchange of fire between several armed men.
The semi-automatic weapons embezzlements attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons have become operational.
It seems like it was definitely a long-term battle.
There were cassavas on the street, on both sides of the side of the sidewalk.
Thus, it seems that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," reported Police Captain Philadelphia Anthony Ginaldi.
Many of the homes and cars in the area were also asses.
No arrests have been made, and the police are reportedly checking video cameras.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit in the hand by a groovy bullet on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her house in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's women's Olympic team for gymnastics and for several reasons.
First, I've been on every Summer Olympic since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second, three gymnastics play a key role in this collection: Simon Byls, Gabby Douglas and Laurent “Lori” Hernández, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this composite, supplemented by Ali Riceman, who is a Jewish woman, and Madison Coshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This prefabricated looks finally like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American women's presence at the top of this sport.
For the last four years, the female gymnast number one was African American.
Last year Simon and Gabby were Nos. 1 and 2.
It's powerful.
In the past, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed him.
Now the world may have witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time World Championship Simona Bails, Douglas and Lori Hernández, performing unexpected but nevertheless virtuous gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth consecutive American to win the gold in female individual absolute primacy.
And Ali Riceman's colleague made silver.
We're witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like this in gymnastics sections around the country.
Simona, Gabby and Lori all took the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic assembly.
They're the "final five," because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on its team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroline's training.
But in reality gymnastics is a expensive sport, and gymnastics are first trained in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, uniforms, contributions for competitions, hotels (for coaches and their gymnastics and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich suburbs that can support this business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get everything from their training, and it's a expensive and long-term responsibility for the families of the gymnasts.
Amy Burman, Coach Simona Byls, and Maggie Hani, Coach Lori Hernández, both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and affordable gymnastics education for the communities of the inestimable number of young girls inspired by Simona, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics, located in Harlem, for more than 15,000 urban young boys (mainly blacks and Latin Americans) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide a high-quality youth gymnastics that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Hymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to exhausting work, discipline and persistence for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive impact on good health, success in school and work.
It's the inspiration of this gathering that will send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
Sports is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simona, Ali, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the "Women's Force" in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors started to announce further strikes after Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected.
The Ministers hoped that the change dispute would be concluded by agreeing with the British Medical Association leaders, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce this contract, saying that NHS was on no land and any subsequent delay would cause damage to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes night work changes and holidays to improve overtime services.
Dr. Ellen McCock, Chairman of the BMA Committee of Young Physicians, said last night in a statement: “The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will support the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied fairly to all doctors”.
It is only eight weeks before the first team of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is required and time is needed.
The IBA ' s attempt to resolve the dispute in the negotiations was met with a reluctance to take action and sometimes a silence on the part of the Government.
And this despite Jeremy Hunte's promise last month that his door is always open.
"The Jeremy Hunte needs to act now, inspire the introduction and respond to the fears of junior doctors.
If he doesn't, then the junior doctors are clear that they're ready for the next strike.
The last stop at the end of April delayed about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses ' receptions, while nurses and consultants were engaged to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The Ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
ISA wants a better payday for 54,000 junior doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS Employers, encouraged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer stated: “The strikers achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on existing teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, sedators and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Associate Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Employees hoped that continued positive support on other important topics — such as staff distribution, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differentials in medicine — was a sign of the seriousness of employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health in meeting the conditions reached by the WIA in November, February and May.
The drug for 2 . . a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are going to use a drug for 2 per day, after the authorities have recommended that they give it to a larger number of people for a longer period of time.
The anti-retroviral drug reduces the risk of reabsorption for people with heart disease.
The drug has already been prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE National Health Service of Great Britain recommended that it be given to people for four years in order to avoid further the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE's National Health Service now recommended that it be provided to people for four years, so as to avoid further the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack affects some 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them experience another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fat accumulation on the walls of the arteries and by the formation of tins.
If the cane breaks apart, it can cause a blood - control tube that blocks blood’s access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if it moves around, it can move through the blood flow and block the blood flow to the brain by causing a stroke.
People who have already experienced one attack are at greater risk of receiving another.
AstraZeneca, a British firm that sells as Brilique, reduces the risk by making the trombes less likely.
The draft NICE instruction published today recommends that people give 90 mg of titagror for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention techniques with about a quarter of people who have had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke — often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative effect on a person’s quality of life.
There is evidence that the tiger, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes among people who have already suffered a heart attack.
In pre-advising the tiger, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of the tiger — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than that.
The PK culture allows for the flourishing of the falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim areas
Ex-Mer. Tower-Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption and served as a catalyst for the Government ' s report
A culture of political correctness has led to the closing of the eyes, which has resulted in widespread falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to the Government's destructive report today.
The former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is being criticized by the police, election observers and the city administration for ignoring the evidence of election irregularities because of “excessive sensitivity to race and religion”.
The former secretary of local communities, now an anti-corruption king, reported that religiously motivated voter intimidation was so strong that the police should be allowed to set boundaries outside the polling stations to protect the frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
To date, the electors must simply indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests putting unbidden ink on people's fingers when they turn down their ballots, with the aim of excluding someone from voting twice.
Better protection must be given to the whistle-blowers, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater access to documents of the local council and to decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a vote scandal in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the current mayor of Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office in connection with a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said that “his campaign was based on the fact that the Muslim believers had a duty to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were called into question or were the result of a conversion when a person voted as someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidences of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly concerned about the mail-voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community were reported to have put pressure on people to vote in favour of their choice of candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photograph, made several recommendations for cleaning up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your identity card to prove who you are.
His report states: “There has been evidence of the pressure placed on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote on the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There were fears that... government agencies had closed their eyes to such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of the `political correctness' to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from the mail ballot papers to stop the “harvesting of votes”.
The report, which is under consideration by Theresa May, also calls for stringent registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
Consideration is given to requiring voters to present their identity cards before voting.
Use unbidden ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their bulletin to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks of the nationality of persons to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year limit on applications for automatic mail voting.
Deploy political campaigners and activists from working with absentee ballots and post-mail envelopes.
Give the police the power to set boundaries around the polling stations.
Amend the law in order to facilitate people's charges of intimidation under the submission of the National Act of 1983.
Make illegal photography at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Intensify training to guarantee that the staff force the voters to go one by one.
Sir Eric is fiercely attacking the city police, saying it's "smartly" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower-Hamlets case.
“The election judge disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts”, he reported.
He was found guilty in the absence of a reasonable doubt — the criminal standard of proof — for a number of reasons.
It also criticizes the unsuccessful “checkings for the sake of the tick” of the electoral registration offices of the city administrations.
Sir Eric said, "The last year court order at Tower Hamlets was a wake-up signal.
Our nation has a proud legacy as a mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Cycling like Kate and other two famous Olympiads in Rio
This week ' s Rio Olympic fans went crazy at the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevo, which appears to be an impressive figure like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old member of the Olympics is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who can boast his own famous double — at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people who appear on our screens at this point in time, F.A. has drawn up a list of Olympians who have more than a superficial similarity to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Allison, a male archer on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's double on the bike track, many people were quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of Leonardo DeCaprio's superstar.
Brady Allison, a member of the U.S. arch team, caused a hurricane in Twitter after images of him looking frighteningly like Wall Street's star.
And in fact, the archer found out about the madness of the social media and admitted that he had heard he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a great similarity, maybe except vegetation on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt point to more this year: the striking similarity between Britain’s jump, Greg Raserford, and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnasticist Alia Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be an accurate copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the South African swimming pool, Cameron Van der Burg was compared to the star of Horus Matthew Morrison for many years.
Turning to the more unexpected: This user considers Nathan to be the “disputable version” of the actor Start.
Another long - standing comparison was between tennisist Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who may boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julius Efimov, can boast not only of the same tanned skin and light hair as of actress Annan McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, according to fans, looks like Joseph Gorgon Levitte's "disputable version."
Surgeons women: Hope Solo, on the left, and the actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, on the right, have the same face and eye
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of the couple.
One Twitter user recently turned to the website to announce his delight that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star and Dexter actress have incredibly similar faces and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of the actress Laura Linni, as well as the winning gold medal of Gabby Douglas, who may boast of his own beautiful broad smile, which resembles the smile of the star "Fuck for Success" Gabriel Union.
Commentor CBC of the Olympiad apologizes for saying "dead as a pig" about the Chinese flyer.
Analysis by Byron MacDonald, fourth place on the 14-year-old end of Ai Yanhan on a 4x200-m free-style female estafet has provoked CBC viewers in direct broadcasts of the Olympiad
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese flyer “started up like a fire” and “died like a pig” during the bay.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he started expressing his own opinion at the end of the final women's estaphet 4x200 m free style.
You could hear McDonald, who was used to the CBC team of commentators to "divorce it with color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese lady dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a wimp, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
China’s 14 - year - old Ai Janhan, who was in the second stage of the estaphet at 1:57.79, was 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing the Canadians to eliminate the backlog from China.
Spectators across Canada responded quickly to the network after they were shaken by the tone and expression used.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted, "Did CBC actually just say that a 14-year-old Chinese floater died like a pig?"?
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
And they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped out a ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately struck Byron MacDonald, and many called for his dismissal
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "It's nothing but #BironMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who broadcast CBC, apologized on direct air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize for the fact that the comment on the presentation on navigation was broadcasted.'
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
SAF concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who were tweeting in response to this statement.
A friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and apologized to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
The calf too was quick to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night we acted quickly to apologize to our audience on live air and to our social media subscribers.
Let's make it clear that Byron's comments were about floating, not about it as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron deeply regrets what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized on live air and tried to clarify his comment by saying that he did not think that his words were interpreted as an assault on the person.
'I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the female estaphet,' he said on the CBC Olympics.
'I've been talking about a flurry speech, not about it in person.'
'It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I'm very sorry.'
Primark's buyer insulted a woman who shamelessly exemplified the underwear in the middle of the store.
Buyers didn't know where to turn their eyes when a woman was naked to try her panties on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she showed them how she looked, pulled them out, and put them back in the regiment.
She continued her search and eventually died four pairs of underwear at the Bowerie Place of Commerce store in Folkston.
The Primark store of the Bowerie Place Trade Centre in Falkland, where a woman used a three-cottle panties before putting them back into the regiment.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children who was in the store at the time, said that after an example of underwear, a mysterious woman again "dressed herself and left the store and bought nothing."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the trading room, she took a couple of panties out of the window, took off her own ankles and panties, and put them on.
"She wasn't trying to find a quiet place somewhere to do it -- she was just standing there shameless."
"They were all staring when she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing she liked, dressed, and left.
"It doesn't seem like she was worried about who was watching her, or that she thought about the man who would eventually buy those panties she was following."
Jenny Davidson of Kent, 33-year-old, said, "It's a shame to think someone's going to take home panties that somebody else's already worn and they weren't sweaty."
The accident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I'm concluding that the staff were probably trying to get these clothes out of the sale after she left, and that's all the better."
"I wouldn't like to come home with a new pair of women's panties and find out the other woman wore them and took them off and they weren't covered."
The representative of Primark said, "Primark knows about the incident that happened at our store in Volkston on Tuesday, 9 August."
All items in question have been seized from sale.
How to protect yourself from attacks with a gun using a tailor
The environment is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Misracci, Master of the Federation of Cruises in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether it comes to you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to beat a robber with his own weapons.
If they come from behind, according to Misrachi, the first thing to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and 'free the line of fire'.
Then you press the gun between your forearm and your shoulder firmly before you hit them in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee goes down in the armpit, and while the attacker bends with pain, you pull the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with a gun, and step back, holding the weapon over him.
For an armed man from the front, the way you perform is to remove his body from the line of fire and quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, move your weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then pull the gun out of his grasp before you step back and aim at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizzadi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of any robbery -- if you're not the master of the tailor -- is to give up your cash.
For a traveler, Jan Wright spends his language in the most filthy places in Europe.
The British traveler has had his immune system and his rapid reflexes severely tested, licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
Jan Wright, 51, a 51-year-old travel writer and author of books from Saffolk, spent the euro's notes, Circus Piccadili's pearls, the button to remove the toilet on the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment that has to become a film called "The Guide of the Traveler-Lizan on the Internal Force" has produced some amazing results.
The idea of licking the slide button on a train used by thousands of others may be extremely repugnant, but there are actually more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During the entire European journey, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about an increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of this stuff brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for tests on the strength of his intestines, traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From the public rails in the stations to the button to shift the toilet, this task has no doubt been tested by his immune system.
In the film he filmed, he said, "From childhood I've been completely careless about my health and I've been pulling a lot of stuff into my mouth from the ground eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
Its test dab showed the value of the luminometer in excess of 4,000 units.
By comparison, the hands that have just been washed must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000, while the hands he had just washed showed less than 60
Wright and the Finnish milk manufacturer Valio filmed a traveler called "Travel-Lizan Guide on the Internal Force" that shows bacteria in various places, for example, in the toilet
In the film, he said, "This is close to one of the worst things I could smell in the bathroom."
There's nothing dirtyer than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The “Inner Force Traveler-Lizun Guide” was withdrawn along with the Finnish milk producer Valio.
The company provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate intestinal growth and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio for snacks, juices and new categories of Nico Voorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended up calling Jan.
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about food, we wanted to put it in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and through this documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakal, who was the film director, added: 'Let's say I lost respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.'
Of course, some things were easier to lick and some were quite rigid.
I'm glad that some of these lickings have been filmed.'
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of respondents linked the oxygen bacteria exclusively to the good condition of the stomach and intestines, while 58 per cent said that they used, at least occasionally, products containing added acid bacteria.
The hooligan family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall Municipal House, just before the eviction
The hooligan family left their municipal home with a loss of 50,000 once they had been evicted for intimidation of their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcoka were expelled from their real estate site in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forcibly evicted from the real estate site, shocked housing and construction co-operatives found the property in a state of repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the chaffs were exposed, the debris was scattered over the floor and the walls were trampled on by the Graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvo, the settler at Cornwall House, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live that way.
There are a lot of things that need to be weighed, because this real estate object will probably be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad name and a bad name.
The couple had three sons who lived in a real estate facility from time to time, and the police reported that the family’s horrors included fighting on the street with baseball beats, intimidation of residents in nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screams, disputes and harassment.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received a warrant for anti-social behaviour in June.
In several rooms of the house, which might be snowy, they found old garbage.
The floor boards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were removed
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and called the police regularly
Cornwall Houseing forcibly evicted her and her partner this week after being granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
Eviction was welcomed with relief by neighbours who said that their lives had been transformed into a hell.
One said, "They didn't care."
We've lived with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is incredible.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet, we didn't get used to it!
Now that they've finally left, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall House neighboring team, said that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and they called the police regularly.
Mussor and the old toys were scattered down the hilly side of the municipal house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant was unable to assume any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family, because eviction is always the latest method of action considered by Cornwall Houseing.
This was a very complex case, since conduct was limited, and their actions must have been shocking to her observing neighbours.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will provide some comfort to the neighbours and signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three of them lived in a house at different times, but said that they were a little over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the burning houses after the eviction
The settlement workers will now have to remove the garbage pile surrounding the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as weights corresponding to supplies and 1,700 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Skeldon was fined after confessing to possession of class B drugs for delivery.
She said that the money went to pay for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being made homeless, there are indications that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were trampled on all over the surface.
The police said they'd try to evict tenants who didn't comply with the rental rules.
Angela Crowe, of the Devon and Cornwall police, stated that the eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'It's a message for those who feel that they can act without charge by the prosecutor, and for those who are harmed by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a low-flying military aircraft nearly touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who loved sunflowers were frightened in their lives
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that it had conducted a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk
This is the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic, while a low-flying aircraft links up over a crowded beach.
A military aircraft is seen flying almost within a distance from hunters on a sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Recreational workers jumped to their feet as soon as they became aware of the noise of the aircraft’s engines but were unable to see what was moving through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the city of Aveira in Kosta Nova.
Daniel Fernandesch, one of several vacationers who published a video of the shock fly on social media, said, "He flew a very low number of times, and there was a moment when it seemed like it would break."
Nuno Arroga added, "I was surfing and I swear I felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
The tourists on the Aveira beach were terribly frightened when the plane appeared from the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the P-3C Orion pilot had conducted a training mission to detect fishing vessels off the coast and had been forced to descend as low as that was the only way to verify them.
The pilot stated that the plane had flown slightly lower than usual owing to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
During the summer, forest fires damaged mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances — dense fog and fire from forest fires that made visibility worse
The aircraft was trained and the pilot was assigned to locate fishing boats as part of the mission
The HASSP system has been compulsory for the general public for more than a year, but most of the cafes and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
The checks are getting more active, and the business is threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP, in Russian version HASSP), a risk analysis and critical points of reference, is mandatory for the use of food by manufacturers and transporters, as well as by companies in the generalty in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
The business checks by Roswanadzor for compliance with these standards began in St. Petersburg in February 2015.
For the time being, however, officials have only issued fines for individual violations of the rules (see the “List of Documents” ...).
The failure to comply with the rules will generally cost the enterprise 600,000 roubles for the first breach and 1 million roubles for the second.
As a system that takes food risks into account and prevents them, HASPS was developed in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about safe food for astronauts.
The system is now being used in all food companies, not only in the United States but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASPA has been operating on TC territory.
The development and implementation of the business system was four years old (the HASSP requirement appeared in the TC regulation in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we had long been convinced that the rule applied only to food production and not to Rectors, as explained by the head of the Helen Ceretler Social Council.
Now everyone's trying to make up for what's missing.
Expected date for resumption of charter flights to Turkey - end of August - beginning of September.
But they will not be demanding, because their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts point out.
The Alliance of Tourism Agencies sent a letter yesterday to the Government requesting the approval of charters.
“For many Russian tourists, the question of selecting a high quality and accessible maritime rest is intractable, as most of the facilities are already booked by the end of September on the resorts of the Krasnodar Province and the Republic of Crimea,” notes the authors of the letters and emphasizes that opening charters in August will not have a significant impact on the current demand for Russian sea-food.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union, if the Russian and Turkish aviation authorities agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
The clear understanding that charters will be renewed until now depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft could fly in September, even August, if the tour operators quickly built programmes and agreed with the airlines on the direction they needed,” says Pavel Rumiants, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the Northwest Regional Office of the RTA.
He said that the possible renewal of charters was good news, but would not affect market power too much, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - had already come back from rest and were preparing for school or on vacations in other countries.
During the barracks season, tours are usually purchased by single travelers and couples.
Charming programs can count on those who are able to rest spontaneously,” says Paul Rumans.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now makes a very budget offer -- 50,000 to 60,000 roubles for a two-way tour, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valery Rosenthal, Director-General of Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is definitely not worth the effort - the bulk of the journeys are already planned.
Paul Rumans also believes that since regular flights to Turkey are in demand, charters will be needed, but the task is not worth waiting for.
"To Turkey, the launch of charters is now a rehearsal for the next season," says Paul Rumans.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season," agrees Valery Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for exemption from NPFL compensation payments under the approved rules relating to compensation for injury caused by injury or other damage to health.
Provision of milk to workers working in hazardous jobs is provided for under article 222 of the Criminal Code.
However, the rules and conditions for extradition are established by order No. 45 of 16 February 2009 of the Ministry of the Development of the Russian Federation.
According to this document, free milk or other equivalent food is provided to workers during days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions due to harmful production factors in the workplace.
On the basis of these standards, the FNF concluded in the letter under review that, pursuant to article 217, paragraph 3, paragraph 3, of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, revenues in the form of the value of milk granted to workers on days of actual employment in hazardous work in accordance with the Regulations and the conditions approved by order No. 45n of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation of 16 February 2009 are exempt from NPFL.
Moscow's Gastrobank remained without a CB license.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew a licence for bank transactions from the credit organization.
According to the regulator, the GASSTRUYBANK AOC had a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
Adequate risk assessment at the request of the supervisory authority and accurate disclosure of the value of the bank's assets have led to reasons for the lending organization to implement measures to prevent bankruptcy.
The credit organization was also involved in questionable transit operations.
A temporary administration has been appointed at the bank until the time of appointment to the competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization, in accordance with federal laws, have been suspended.
AO GASTRIBANKA is a member of the deposit insurance system.
We will recall that the payment of insurance to bank investors, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Act No. 177-FZ on the insurance of natural persons' deposits in banks of the Russian Federation is 100 per cent of the balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total.
Payments, according to the Investment Insurance Agency, will start no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the reports, as of 1 August 2016, GASSTRUYBANK was 335 in the bank system of the Russian Federation.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS died in Syria
Cadiz Soultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Counsel Tasin Akundji stated that her family had learned of her death in Raqka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is believed that it was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqka, a band in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
She was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
“It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all of this is as a threat and a promise to others that these are the risks involved when travelling to a war zone to persuade people to make the same choice,” said Akundji.
In February 2015, he and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane into Turkey and then onto a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family said that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reid claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Gulland as a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge if elected
The leader of democracies in the Senate, Harry Reed, said he was confident that a democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton would be nominated to the Supreme Court by Judge Merric Gharland if he was elected as President.
The republics of the Senate blocked Garland's claim, but as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next president will choose the person who will be able to replace the last Justice of the Supreme Court, Antonine Skalia.
Reid said at the conference bell on Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Galand "with some confidence."
Reed's representative later said that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about if she was going to raise Galland, and she was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "roll the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Colombia.
Reid stated that the Republicans who block the Gharland’s nomination were “inviting” and “assistances” of the Republican candidate for President Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't suitable for the post.
Triats states that the erotic calendars for 'women as well as men'
The Treaty magazine works with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of nudity, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked muzzles.
President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of naked models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for Men."
I make it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar's the same.
"We need to go back to showing an eternal and classical naked figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," said Shaw in a press release declaring the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a great work of art.
Models can present photographs online or in person at open casts in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow's going to give us notes of unfair Internet shops.
In Moscow, we're going to release a monument that tells us how not to be a victim of an Internet shop.
This was reported in Rosvanadezor, writes M24.
It is reported that agency specialists are preparing a monument to help citizens choose the right Internet store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure is divided into several sections.
This will be general information and legislative framework, rules of delivery of goods, and means of protecting their legitimate rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to properly draw up the claim and so on,” said Rosvannadzor.
The memory is being finalized so far.
It will later be posted on the Rosrevanadzor website in Moscow, and it is planned to issue a printed version and distribute it to Moscow.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation issued a statement naming the second suspect for the organization of diversification in Crimea.
Persons from Ukrainian and Russian nationalities who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among these are Panov Eugenius Alexandrovich and Zacthei Andrey Romanovich.
"They all give confessions," says the communication.
In the past, a resident of Zapoena province, Eugenius Panov, who had been detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, had confessed his guilt during the interrogation.
FAS will fine Google for 438 million rubles.
The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine of 438 million roubles on the agency website.
“The fine for Google was 438 million roubles for violation of anti-monopoly legislation.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay the fine as soon as possible," said Alexei Docenko, Deputy Head of FAS.
In the course of the investigation, FAS found that Google supplies smartphone manufacturers who are sold on Russian territory with a Google Player app shop only if other applications of the corporation are installed.
These include a search engine that should be placed on the head screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of the Federal Act on the Protection of Competition (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the enforcement of the order will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will benefit our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act needs to be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, including,” noted the head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Department of the Russian Federation FAS, Elena Zaeva.
The authorities suspect 16 Russian shops are conspiracy.
The New Book Network was fined for selling 50 days before my suicide.
The New Bookstore Network is fined for selling Stace Kramer "50 Days Before My Suicide," reports Moscow City News.
As reported in Roswanadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book may be regarded as “provoking or motivated suicide behaviour of children and adolescents”.
The Ostankin District Court confirmed the violation of the requirements for the distribution of information products to children and ordered a fine of 49 copies of printed material arrested by the Roswannadzor Authority.
The source in the New Book Book confirmed that it was Stace Kramer's work.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookshops in Moscow were subject to checks for a book “50 days before my suicide”.
Moscow will have a memorial evening for Ernest the Unknown.
Moscow will be the night of the memory of Sculpator Ernst of the Unknown, reports TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central Letterary House.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say good-bye to the Unknown in person in the United States.
It was therefore decided to arrange this evening for those who want to mention it on their own land," stated the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It noted that this was important to the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
In the evening, close friends of the Unknown were invited, including poet Evgenius Eutushenko, artist Boris Messererer, President of the Puskin Irin Antonov, director of the Russian Ministry of Culture, Vladimir Medinski, Head of the Culture Department of Moscow, Alexander Kibowski, Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Leonid Petnikov.
In the past, it has been reported that the relatives of Ernst the Unknown plan to conduct a sculptor in New York, allegedly before 14 August.
The final consumer blamed himself: Who actually buys the records?
Middle-aged single men like to blame.
And until you break down the comment section with the rude insults under the pseudonymous Men of Middle-Lite, this claim is derived from the factual evidence.
According to YouGov, so much of the renaissance discussed is due, not to the boom among the generation of two thousand who want to enter the new material object, but to the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with high probability are between 45 and 54 years of age, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It's also more than just an act of gathering lovers -- it's emotional: older buyers are slightly more likely to have feelings (56% versus 53%) and to enjoy loneliness (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov’s results correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would have followed me as I walked down the center of a busy Soho street, in a modest grey suit, and violently gestured before the scene, laying hands and saying something impressive like, "Yeah, let's see."
All right, let's see.
While Soho’s heart is slowly losing its charm and dirt — hotels, cafes, Paperhase shops now fill buildings once occupied by independent sellers — several music stores with fantastic skills remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these stores and try to measure their age and emotional moods with the help of observation.
Glasgow Stuart, aged 55, who followed me from Sister Ray, to Reckless Records, London for a half-day meeting, and walks around shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I suppose so," he said.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates, shown above (he e-mailed me pictures, I didn't follow him home) along the lines of his living room.
His reason for acquiring so many albums and singles is partly derived from his available income: he can now buy records that he couldn't afford when they came out and buy the items he sold when he was young and small.
"Many of what I acquire is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably too young to buy," he said.
He agrees that those who buy records are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
It's my fault.
Wees, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets are in line with the YouuGov profile.
He noticed, however, a new wave of people influenced by media noise who heard of their return and felt the obligation to buy their old records.
According to the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually in about 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their wine to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records," he says.
This may explain the boom among renaissancers of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the plates?
Just spend a few seconds at a store like Phonyca to realize that plate shops offer a comfortable society to people with similar perspectives.
According to Wese, some of the older clients are, inter alia, insulted by a cashless pay system.
Some wine lovers may be shocked by the digital world and prefer to move away from familiar envelopes for plates, objects that awaken memories of young people.
"I think sometimes it could be filling up a void or having material things as a sort of calm," says Wes.
Since I'm the collector myself, I have it, and I think many people have it, too.
It's a simple way to get your head on.
"We're like their social workers," said a colleague in a plate stack.
In April, an ICM survey showed that almost 50% of the people who bought a vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a player that they never use, whereas 7% of those who buy wine do not have a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably have looked seriously puzzled, slatting with the Bosanovs.
The "trepheic" aspect of recovery is what Johnny, 42 years of age, said to be working at Sounds of the University (calculation of data: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead plate so we can put it in our regiment," he says.
It's not a lot of interest, but it's definitely happening.
More of an article, less of music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger, older, little under the age of 20 who just get to know this.
The Fopp, who's now taken away almost the whole floor of the vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops -- the last sont and sex pop of Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, is going through columns -- it's nice to see diversity in their clients.
None of them look particularly lonely, but a painful psychological trauma is hard to establish 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanora, 27, went to Foppp for a few minutes, looking at the various plates available for sale.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make much money, she says, so collecting the records isn't a good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but beauty is guilty of ...", she goes into dreams with a breath full of love.
I don't know how to explain it; it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of fans: city fashions.
While I'm creating an illusion that I'm looking at jeans-covered shorts, I'm looking at a group of teenage girls, every minute that gathers around Polarioid's cell, before my father and his daughter start talking about buying a Crosley player.
On the left is a ladder with plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Flatwood Mack: a mixture of modern styles and classics, binding plates for any medium collection.
No one looks — perhaps because they are mere ornaments — some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "pretty vinyl."
But given that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few clients to the depths of Socho for a while, almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, a segment of a population that is more likely to have more time and more money than most people do is a layer that spends most of its money on luxury items like wine.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho plate shops, they do not exclude the huge number of women collectors and wine lovers who exist in reality, in plate shops and online forums.
These people probably work all over the school or office.
But they obviously don't spend the morning of Thursday by walking through the plate shops on Berwick Street, by slitting plates and avoiding the looks of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland’s Polar Shark, the longest - living vertebral animal, is a video report
Scientists claim that the Greenland polar shark has the largest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, states that the record has set the female between 272 and 512 years of age and a length of 5 meters.
The French court rejects the offer to remove shops in the Jungli refugee camp
The French court rejected the proposal by the Kale authorities to demolish dozens of home-made shops and restaurants in the Jungli camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the trial this week, the Kale authorities stated that the State should be able to destroy a total of 72 homemade shops where people in the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40s) or simple dishes for several euros in home-made restaurants.
The Kale prefecture said that these places must be destroyed because they are parallel economies that do not pay taxes, and because they carry fire risks and sanitary risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, stating that free meals offered by the pro-Government association and other groups do not provide sufficient food for the growing population in the camp.
They said that homemade shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free food for those in need.
The Lille Court held that there was no legal basis for expelling the managers of 72 homemade shops, but stated that the problems of Kale's prefecture “were fully understood”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the balei, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely poor conditions."
He said that the spaces provided calm places for refugees and volunteers to meet.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the Children's Café of the Book of Jungley at the camp, which works for no profit and offers 200 lunches per day, English and French classes and counselling for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escort in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter sent to Guardian said his closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not over eight years of age."
Two charitable institutions, the Assistance to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the population in the Jungli camp had increased to well over 9,000 — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in arrivals during the summer.
Microarea libraries are inviting young freelancers to educational programmes.

On Sunday, 14 August, a "Fiscult-Hello" game program will be held for boys from the northern neighbourhood of the branch library.
Britain stops on silver in rugby 7, after Fiji's master class allows them to take gold.
Britain's impressive series in Rubie 7 was left to the final obstacle by the Fiji team in the finals on Thursday night, when they were totally destroyed 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has been given a master-class in ball ownership, unlocking, oblivion, game support, line running and rough force to win gold, the first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with little comfort in the form of silver — the third in Britain a day — and they could be proud of their efforts at the first Olympic tournament on Rubie 7, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated on their way.
The painful beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier that day, could have returned to have a negative impact on them in the finale.
But, despite all of this, Fiji has been defeated in this form by a better team of 15 people.
This may be some comfort to the British — but probably not — that at least one British will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Chief Coach of Fiji - Ben Ryan, former British chief of Wimbledon.
It was a trip for the British.
Eight years ago, underneath Ryan, they lost every game on Adlaide Seaves.
They lost just one here.
These blows will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began to be great, for fun, as a reflection of Britain’s attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and World Series champions went up 5-0 when Ocea Colinisau dived into the corner.
Having four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank that had been realized.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The remarkable attempt to intercept Mitchell has kept the man Mount Leon Nakarawa from killing a third man, but it only delayed Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jas Veremaloua made the touchdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakareva added another one after the resumption and there was still more than a minute... in the first half.
Vatemo Rabovo then broke through several more subtle attempts to intercept the Great Britain and storm the line to get a point.
Implementation led to an interruption of 29-0.
It seemed as if Fiji had been born to play rugby 7, while Britain still had a trade.
Which is to a large extent true.
Great Britain had massive replacements for half of the game, and they purchased a Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which was good for the first half, until Joshua Tuisov went through after some brilliant Fijian interaction.
Dan Norton took over an attempt for the British to make a truckdown in the left corner to make an bill of 36-7, but the game had long been on the path of South Sea Islanders whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing in stands.
Fiji’s approach could not have been admired.
The mother of William adorned the Fijian cake, which did not need to be beautified, with another attempt in recent seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell to a lawn that was totally defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-finals, and Britain slightly bypassed South Africa in a tense half-final of one attempt at each — the difference between the British implementation.
Kyle Brown takes the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some wonderful work of his legs, broke the line and scored it under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, brother of the 15th party of England, Anthony, succeeded — and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the Drill against cancer
There'll be no more exciting gold at these games, and it's talking about something.
From the first to the last, 220 heavy climbs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have found added value to their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of Coach Robin Williams was as long as they were striving for the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in Britain's sports annals who got to this height.
Their superiority was absolute, and ultimately it was their 39th unconvinced speech, again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant athletes who slide on the surface with the elegance of swans do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
For every gold dam, a ready-made battalion of hands that is contributing to the gradual growing victory, which is important, and there are no arms that were more important than those of a coach who, 30 months ago, when diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had ureter cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
That might have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your species a little bit for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky to be able to begin treatment early in 2014 in an inter-sezone, keeping the schedule at a minimum, if that could be the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed payment, so I had to get along quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and was walking 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The dam itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next moment after their victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little bit more than usual, trying to overcome his own feelings.
Stanning, the captain of the artillery regiment in Afghanistan behind her shoulder, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a little bit too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much this means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and Robin too.
It's been fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't ask for a better partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose a race in five years.
This couple sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even on the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark began approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very much in the phase.
Helen called out, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's very important not to get distracted right now.
We had a good start, but we didn't try to do something amazing.
We weren't waiting for fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to get a good sin and get out and win this race, which we did.
It's gonna take a year for a couple to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at her wedding next month, her own TV adventure seeker, Steve Beckshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
It would mean too much pressure.
It took London about six months to realize that I had become the Olympic championship.
It was so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the deadline for the destruction of food prohibited for entry into Russia.
The decision was signed by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo on countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in our country in August 2014.
The ban has since been extended on several occasions, and is now in force until 31 December 2017.
Some agricultural products, raw materials and food are prohibited from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and dairy products have been banned.
The management of food brought into the country without embargo has been under way in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, some 100 tons of prohibited products were seized from sale.
Hunting for "prohibition"
There will be rains and storms in Moscow on Friday.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, which will cause precipitation and lower air temperature.
The air will warm to 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C] during the day.
For example, on Saturday night in Moscow, there will be short-term rains, possible storms and wind surges of up to 15 m/s.
It is expected that it will rain between 12 and 17 m/s with storms and winds.
Rains and storms are also projected in Orlovsk, Kursk and Voronez regions, reporting “Dy.ru”.
Next working week, rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rates are higher than the commitments made by Russia at the time of accession to the WTO.
“This is the first time WTO took a decision against the Russian Federation”, states the communication on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient proof that the measures of the Russian Federation were “systematic” or “integrated”.
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the report of the Russian Ministry of Economic Development.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to appeal to the World Trade Organization for action by Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is referred to in a statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that US conduct in resolving disputes in WTO undermines the organization's principles of discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other members of WTO, owing to the refusal of Americans to approve South Korean Judge Chan Song Hwa for a second term.
Therefore, Russia will not apply to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now consists of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President's administration was replaced by a leader
President Vladimir Putin of Russia appointed Sergey Ivanov Anton Vaino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin had made real changes in the President's administration and hoped that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Waino stated during the meeting that he considered the anti-corruption work he had begun as President Ivan's Chief of Administration important and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Formerly, Izvedia wrote that experts consider the resignation of Sergei Ivanov as the head of the administration to be transparent and understandable and repositioning nothing will change the Kremlin administration in principle.
They note that the leader who worked for the President ' s administration for a long time has gone and has effectively built up the ARs.
He was replaced by the Deputy Chief of Administration, Anton Waino, a man who was well aware of the work.
In Poland, they say they won't buy fuel from Gazprom.
The State-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that within a few years the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become intractable because of the reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Bogslav Majetz.
His words are conveyed by TASS.
"Maybe we're not going to buy gas at all, we're diversifying our supplies now.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be East, CNG-terminal raw materials and Norway,” said Majetz.
Gazprom is now dominant in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that a Russian supplier had delivered almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, a 30 per cent increase over 2015.
The share of Russian gas giants in PGNIG procurement increased to 49.8 per cent, compared with 40 per cent earlier.
We will recall that on 22 July, the Polish anti-monopoly office did not agree to the establishment of the Gasprom joint venture and its European partners in the construction of the North Stream-2 gas pipeline.
However, one month earlier, Poland had left a request for Gazpromo to supply 11 billion cubic metres of gas for North Stream 2.
Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Holding Board, made this statement.
The North Flow 2 auction will take place in 2017 and the auction is scheduled for the fall of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action in connection with the Polish side's intention to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, as stated by the Vice-President of the Board of the Company, Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that during the first quarter of this year, Poles had only increased by 42 per cent the supply of gas from the Russian Federation.
Gazproma added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG filed an application with the Stockholm Arbitration Court did not mean that negotiations were terminated.
The Polish company had previously resorted to a court of law in order to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall that the Polish Government's Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the Gasprom contract.
Poland's contract with Gasprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Government of Poland Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimski, stated that his country could in six years refuse to supply blue fuel from the east.
He said that Warsaw planned to build a new terminal for the supply of liquid natural gas, Baltic Pipe, which would connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
The “North Flow 2” provides for the construction of two strands of maritime gas pipeline with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine ' s Crimea border.
This was reported by the first head of the CMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
“I can confirm that the CMM has increased the number of observers in this field,” he said in response to a question from journalists, transmitting “RIA News”.
According to OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm and there are no security incidents.
Observers followed three crossings across the Russian-Ukrainen border.
A video of the Kak-42 passenger aircraft landing at Ufa airport, which ran out of the 400-metre runway and landed on the left wing, appeared on the network.
The video was published by the TV channel "360".
The CP occurred at 4:30 Moscow time.
The flight of Krasavia came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, and there were no victims.
The aircraft was transported to the parking lot.
The Oofa airport works normally.
The Portal Investigation Department in the transport of the UK was looking into the reason for the tight landing of the liner aircraft.
The UN investigates the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict denied the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistura, considered the fact that had occurred to be indisputable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have initiated investigations into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on the toxic gas attack, suspected to be chlorine, was provided on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, aircraft had dropped poison bombs, but that in Moscow those charges had been cited as an introduction.
The Russian Ministry of Defence later accused the current opposition group Harakatit Nur al-Din al-Zinqi.
Soon it became known that there were two toxic gas bombs.
This was confirmed by BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the start of the burning of my eyes, the difficulty of breathing," quotes an eyewitness.
At least 7 people were killed and 23 hospitalized as a result of the attack.
If the use of poisoning gas was confirmed by experts, action would be considered a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told journalists: “There is much evidence that this has happened.”
The prohibition of military use of chlorine is prescribed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
While all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo complicates the daily targeting of its areas and terrorists obstructs the withdrawal of the inhabitants.
According to Reuters, the United Nations is waiting for Russia to establish “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current three-hour silence in the organization is considered “not sufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped”.
Staffan de Mistura ' s Humanitarian Adviser, Jan Egeland, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required every week to deliver relief supplies and evacuations from the city.
“We have to send bulk goods from convoy trucks to areas where roads are practically destroyed and those left behind are mined,” said Mr. Egeland. “But the Russian delegation has confirmed the willingness to join us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia regarding the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” are continuing.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the ongoing fighting for Aleppo, the second-largest Syrian city, Russia, on 11 August, announced the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities regime, which will be in effect on a daily basis on Thursday.
Humanitarian windows are designed to ensure that medicines, food and essential items are delivered to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was taken against the background of increasing international pressure against Moscow, demanding that the military operation be terminated and that the negotiating process be resumed.
Four people were killed in a series of bombings in Thailand’s resorts.
Immediately, several explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed, 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions hit the town of Hua-Hin.
Ten foreigners, four nationals of States, were among the victims.
None of the terrorist groups had taken responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs had been quick to state that Islamists were not involved.
Several persons have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
Preliminary reports from the local police indicate the extent and nature of the explosions that they were directed against the military leaders of the country.
Attacks took place on popular tourist resorts, including Patong beach in Phuket and Hua Hen, Trang and Surat Thani.
Following the arrival of the military Hutu in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, an increase of 1.5 million over 2015.
The first suspects in preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, and Colonel Chrisana Patanacharoen has reported to the police.
He added, but in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, “they are certain that they are not linked to international extremist groups”.
It is too early to draw conclusions,” said Mr. Patanacharoen.
But we know for certain that these incidents are not directly linked to any type of terrorism, in fact, local diversification, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The bombing took place on the birthday of Queen Sykrit of Thailand.
The Thai Hutu considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to General Sithić Srisopacharenat, bombs were bombed remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside the trees on busy streets filled with restaurant-eating tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who sold street food.
The persons of the remaining victims are not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them four Germans, three Dutch nationals, two Italians and an Austrian citizen.
Russia is not among the victims of the bombings, as reported by the Rostourist press service.
Local experts also link the bombings to the referendum held on 7 August, at which 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution drafting commission appointed by the military Hutu.
Voters needed to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper House of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role in electing the Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
We will recall that on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the commander of the country ' s army, Praut Chan-Ocha.
That step, he said, had been driven by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, and dispersed protesters and the upper House of Parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Thai Government, headed by Prime Minister Jinglak Chinavat in January 2014, announced a state of emergency in Bangkok and adjacent provinces.
The special regime extended 60 days.
How two explosions blew up in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred at the Victory Memorial in Bangkok, where one of the main protests took place, affecting 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by motorcycles unknown.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and engaged military forces to protect the demonstrators.
The development of conditions began in Sukhom Loga.
As “Happily” has become known, the Government has been requested to align the draft terms of the Land Log gold auction with the retention of two key limitations.
It is proposed that companies with 25 per cent or more of foreign nationals and those with no minimum of 25 per cent of State participation be excluded from the auction.
The industry does not expect the Government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are no longer at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction may be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature introduced the draft order and terms of the auction to the Government at Russia's largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, Suha Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million Unzs) and told two sources of “Happy” familiar with the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, specifying one of them.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project had been introduced to the Government.
A representative of the non-drive director, Vice-Prime Minister Alexander Bronin, said that the project had not yet been submitted to the officer's office.
“The auction may be announced as early as August, as soon as the Government order is issued, and given the time frame for collecting applications from potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender may be held in October”, says the Ministry of Nature.
According to the October data, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants described in the option, which was sent to the Ministries and FOVIAM for agreement in July (i.e., the . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The first is the existence of at least 25% of the capital applicants.
The second is denial of access to auctions for companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the FO-57 understanding of investments in strategic societies.
According to the two draft articles of the FM, as already written on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual nationality may be excluded from the auction.
The Government is entitled to impose such restrictions, since Suha Log is a federal subservient (more than 50 tons of gold).
In the Ministry of Nature, it confirmed that the project would “contain restrictions on the admission of foreign companies” but refused to comment on the details prior to the Government's order.
The requirement for capital participation in the auction was raised by the Irkutsk Region, spoke in December 2015 “Hi” in the Ministry of Nature, and confirmed later by the Governor of the region, Sergey Lévichenko, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, “to have an investment agreement with Rostech”.
Those who lobbied for a restriction on the admission of aliens don't specify.
“But it's in the spirit of time: not to give control in Russia's largest gold mine against the background of Western sanctions”, says the interviewer, “Welcome”, familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The Head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donski, on 1 August, stated that foreigners “may go to the consortium” if the claimants attract them “as financial entities, as technological partners”.
I think it's unlikely that the conditions will be adjusted in the government.
The main claimant in Suha Log in the industry is the consortium of the largest gold miner of the PAO Pole, controlled by Suleiman Kerim Said's son, and Rostach.
In July, partners created SPL Gold, where the Pole has 51% share, and the RT-GR structure has 49% share.
In Rostcheh, the comments were withdrawn, the Pole stated that it was “unreservedly interested in the asset” and had all the necessary competence and resources to develop it.
“But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the declaration of conditions”, added the “Police”.
The auction may involve FRASA, but the decision for the Government of the Russian Federation has been made by the sources.
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops the assets on Chukotka, have announced opportunities to participate in the development of the Dry Loga, while Polymetal and Nordgold are not interested in the asset, according to the “Jose” data.
In December 2015, the head of the Union of Gold Manufacturers of the Russian Federation, Sergei Kashuba, estimated a $2.5 - 4 billion investment in Suja Log.
Most potential claimants are afraid not only of the amount of investment, but also of the complexity of the project: the stocks and technologies for dealing with complex ores need to be seriously explored and explained by industry interlocutors.
On the pension market, the largest M&A deal, the “KIT Finance Administrator”, launched the process of combining four NPF-controlled companies.
As a result, a PNF will be created on the basis of the GasFund Pension Savings Fund, with a savings rate of about 373 billion roubles.
The start of the process of pooling the four pension funds, namely, KIT Finance, Promagrofund, Heritage and Gas Foundation Pensions, was announced yesterday by the owner of 100 per cent of the KIT Finance Administrator ' s GTA funds.
“The reorganization shall be carried out in accordance with the CB, subject to the requirement of non-degradation of the terms of the contracts in force”, states the company's communication.
The association is based on the “Gaz Foundation Pension Savings”.
As the director of the NPF, Oleg Biagostskiy, notes, pooling funds presents several challenges: enhancing the geography of the presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each fund and streamlining corporate governance.
He said that the target date for the completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the integration of the NPF, the “Gazfund Pension Savings” will become the largest player in the market of the SPC.
As at 31 March, the pooled fund pension savings exceeded 373 billion roubles.
According to the accounts on the fund website, the beneficiaries of their owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently Anatoly Gavrilenco (through the GCO-controlled possession of 65 per cent) and the Gazfund NPF (35 per cent).
However, the group itself launched much later than the competitors.
For example, the O1 NPF control group “The Future” devoured “Stalfund” early this year.
The joint NPF is now joining Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
“Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for structural tasks”, notes Nicholas Sidorov, director of the NPF.
Since April, active work on the consolidation of funds has also been under way in the Safmar pension group, the NPF “European”, “Education and Science” and “Regional Funds” to join the Safmar NPF until the end of the current year.
In 2017, the NPF Trust will join them.
“Unification of funds will enhance control over risks, operational processes and costs”, noted in the Safmar pension group.
The delay in the pooling of funds, which was sustained by the KIT Finance Administrator, may be due to several reasons, experts point out.
Until recently, the NPF was unable to buy more than 40 per cent of the production of infrastructure bonds to which the group was actively located.
Following amendments to the CB regulation in March this year, there are no such restrictions for a number of issuers meeting the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, the whole issue can be bought by one major player,” points out Yuri Nogin, director of the ACRA financial institution rating group.
Several top-15 NPF managers on assets refer to the division of spheres of influence and, as a result, of staff appointments in a single fund to be agreed upon by the owners of the group.
Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment yesterday.
The Gazfund NPF did not respond either.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and cost-effective exercise, this solution will be justified at a long distance.
According to Mr. Sergei Okolesov, director of the consulting company Pennsylvania, Gas Foundation has fewer outflows, accession will stabilize the group's other funds.
This will take into account the more successful experience of the NPF, KIT Finance, and Promagrofund, in the construction of retail sales of PPS, as well as the use of more modern PPs.
The CB's requirements for NPF processes and human resources are constantly growing, and therefore it is not appropriate to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, that Paul Mithrofanov, the managing director of the corporate ratings “Expert RA”.
“The effect of reducing duplicative functions will clearly cut off the potential costs of association,” notes Mr. Mithrofanov.
The cost of unifying the four Sergei Okolesnov funds is estimated at 30 to 50 million roubles.
“The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million roubles a year, while consolidating the budget in the medium term is effectively reduced,” Mr. Okolanov is sure.
A Russian rental was made of the good Svenev film Pete and His Dragon.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the smoldering dragon, the gasping story, and the style of the country are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic, he says.
The frightened child was chosen by a dragon who became a human child, a tender babysitter, and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, after a puppy from a fairy tale book, plays a pet and sleeps in his arms.
Six years later, when he was abandoned and covered in a string, he could no longer be distinguished from another mindless logger, Maughley.
In this form, Petea finds her husband's red - haired female Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the Gavin Brigade (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressive in the woods.
Now she'll not only have to believe in the dragon's existence, but she'll have to help save it.
Pete is taking an accelerated course of being human, surrounded by idiot Americans who wear cowboy shirts, a moral code in the heart and smiling more blindly than any commercials.
No character looks and acts too terrible to be truly hated or feared by a viewer.
Even Gavin, who sought out the unpretentious inhabitants of the forests under his control, is far from being a miserable villain.
A huge, fluffy dragon has also been made with the good face of a bulldog, the air - lined wing, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon urchin urchins, urchins, even grunts, and fortunately doesn't say, but he always wants to caress it, which makes him a good contrast to all the famous film dragons.
Elliot’s visual image and the manner in which he is held provide such a high level of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, he starts to sobb into three swarms not only of young spectators but also of adults.
It's amazingly good and young Oaks Figla as Pete, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuosoly issues a canonical grandfather who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to produce the fantasticly nice remix of the forgotten Drainev film Dracon Pitha of 1977, right from nose to tail and remembered only by an animation and a game film, and make him the most mental film this summer?
It's not like a miracle has helped.
In his painting, Louri took only two things from the original: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
Musical numbers and most of the weird jokes remain behind.
This good story reads features from the Bamby, the Extraplanetian, and many other lovely hearts of children's paintings.
The Disney studio continues to expand successfully the gallery of high-quality remews of the twenty-first century.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon are not as beautiful as the Book of the Jungles, and there's no skilled villain that Kate Blanchett found as a stepmother in the new "Bulk".
But this naive film is no less successful in putting faith in miracles and good things in the best of the Svenevian traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magical castle, the director of Lori, will be given again for the artistic film adaptation of the story of Peter Pane.
The "Piet and His Dragon" tandem David Lowry and writer Toby Halbrewkes entered a new ambitious project about a non-adulterated boy on James Barry's single-name story.
Journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged with a new charge
The lawyers of journalist Alexander Sokolov, RBC, accused of organizing the extremist structure, stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had found fault with their defendant ' s case.
That the Public Prosecutor's Office made this statement, we learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We were scheduled to take part in a court hearing on the issue of limiting the reading of the criminal case file, but the result was that the meeting did not take place and the investigators informed us of the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office,” adds Olga Dinze, a lawyer.
She explained that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had told the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the material collected were not in conformity.
The investigators will now have to clear the gaps in the evidence base and bring new charges against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CK) would appear in the case or would remain the same, but with other reasons and new evidence, Ms. Denze clarified.
Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015, as reported by I.C.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the charge the RBC journalist the phrase “to spread the political situation towards instability” and “to render power unlawful”.
Alexandr ZILBERT, correspondent at Commersant'boscosport, lived the life of an Olympic in the Olympic village, inspected a Russian prefabricated house, had lunch in a local dining room, and even then passed the WADA test.
I don't think life's dead here for a second.
Even at night.
The last startups sometimes end at midnight, after which athletes need another hour and a half to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, the village is being settled and evicted without stopping, as some athletes end their talks and leave Brazil and, on the contrary, just arrive here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all Olympian delegations are pulling on one of the temporary tenets.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues,” says Igor Kazikov, head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team.
It's hot water, I'm sorry, toilets.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, it's just that no one came to clean up.
Then the cliners came in, but they just put some stuff on the floor, and that's all.
The floors are, you see, innovative.
Mol, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these fields are common!
So, you've got a change in the clinical company, and now you're all OK.
The Olympic village is a South Boutovo, a sleeping area fenced on one side of the mountain, on the other side a spectacular roar, and areas filled with water.
There is still a two-metre-long railway fence around the perimeter, along which automatics walk.
A total of up to 17,000 people may be housed in the village in 3604 apartments located in 31 homes.
On one of the 18 stories, a huge Russian flag hangs - this house is fully devoted to the needs of our prefabricated one.
By looking at a small foye at the entrance, you can immediately identify the problems that appear to be most pressing for the domestic team.
There are two announcements on the registration desk: "Please don't throw paper into the toilet" and "Precise for a badge.
The table itself drowns in tracts.
Their cheery color contrasts with the headlines of the booklets: “Preparation on infectious diseases for persons travelling to Rio de Janeiro”, “First aid in drowning, falling foreign body into the airway, losing consciousness - the stages of cardiovascular resuscitation”, “First assistance in burns, heat, fractures and bleeding”.
The text inside is very encouraging.
For example: “Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not all will have a favorable outcome.
Of course, there is a health centre located in the built-up Russia, which is ready to provide qualified assistance, including relaxing and sporting massage, to the people of the home at any time.
It's the headquarters of our delegation that's on the side of the medical center.
Near the door is an inspiring poster, "No matter what, we will win!"
And, of course, poems:
All the arguments are absolute bullshit!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let the less taste of victory come to us Russia will not retreat or break!
And for a greater lift, there's an announcement saying, "Dear brothers and sisters!
Following the blessing of the Holy patriarch of Moscow and all of Russie Kirilla, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Olympian compiled Russia is provided by the protoire Andrey Vladimirov.
You can order melabes and other demands on the phone...
In general, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Celebrations for all faiths.
And the Russians, they're in a privileged position, they've got their own chapel.
With the elevator loaded from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs recommended for use during the fire.
And in the dark he stumbled over the bodies lying on her.
Apparently, these were sleeping female employees of the new clinical company.
I think they're ready to throw themselves at innovative floors at any moment, and they've decided to set themselves up for a quiet hour right on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was expected to meet with an old acquaintance, Vitaly Fedrovich Dubko, a trainer of ourbatutists who led them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and a European champion named Jan Paul kindly agreed to show her rooms.
The well-deserved trainer of Russia has much to complain about, but it's not critical.
The sanuse is one in four, but it's wide.
The closet, of course, is funny, it's fabric, it's not trusting, but you can put things in it.
"No, you're pretending they're out of tea!" "Sweelan Kuznetsov, the tennis guy I met in the main dining room, with his hands.
The main reason for this is at least because it represents a space of 2,700 square metres and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There's 60,000 servings per day, free of charge.
The menu options are: "The Best of Brazil", "The World's Cooks," "Asiatic Foods" and "Pice, Macaron Products".
The last option, as I watched, is very popular with our volleyballists.
But let's say I haven't found soup in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
What soups?
It's a good thing I took Chinese with me, you know.
And a teapot.
But in order for you to understand, our food is even worse.
There's nothing you can choose here, despite the inhospitable uniformity.
I've personally chosen a steam coke and a meatball in a tomato sauce.
A tablet bearing its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, as well as the food value and the availability of allergens, is next to each dish.
Well, I'm pretty sure I've had enough.
I don't even know why this is the line at the local McDonald's.
The fat, relaxed, you can say "dark" athletes outside the restaurant are waiting for our best friends from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're misleading the Victorian trap that gets the winner a T-shirt.
Invoking, you can say!
To receive a gift, you need to answer at least eight of the ten questions correctly.
I've got questions in Russian! I've been attacked by a VADA girl.
But the wrong one was attacked.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic rush, of course.
The situation has been exacerbated by the second question: “If I have received notification of a doping control, should I immediately go to a doping control point?”
I said, "No, I've got one hour."
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot I didn't have to wait for WADA to weaken.
Anyway, we have to be right now.
Well, during the seventh stage of Victoria, my position became completely critical.
I thought, for some reason, that if I find it difficult to maintain a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and by the way hard for me!), I could use bio-addictions to get "additional nutrients to increase my productivity."
No, they won't!
More specifically, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not categorically prohibited but strongly rejected in several proposals.
It's not fair playing WADA!
What's up, Russia?
There's nowhere to retreat, behind Efimov, Isinbaev and all of our bloodthirsty team.
That's why I'm focused and I've won an unfortunate T-shirt in my last effort.
Know ours!
In a victorious mood, I fell into the phytness center in the neighborhood.
I've got to count the trainers.
Got 250.
It was surprising to note that no Russian athlete had ever been found in this threat of running paths.
But maybe that's the right thing to do.
Let the one who doesn't know how to play be trained!
And here's one of our guys sitting in a clinic next to us.
In line for the eye specialist.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In the clinic, as in the whole village, where there is no spit, there's a condom delivery machine.
It contains an encouraging call: "Go out with the condom!"
The only remaining is to twist the iron that resembles the pen of the door lock, and a condom made of Amazonian natural latex is readily removed.
I took it alone to remember.
The athletes didn't get rid of them. They had 450,000 of them.
There is an entire entertainment centre in the Olympic village to celebrate and celebrate.
In any case, there is an educational tablet that reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The Centre is filled with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices that look like video trainers.
I'm interested in a friend in the form of a Ukrainian prefabricator who is actively using a wild toy.
Of course, I could just say that I don't want to talk to a man in the form of a prefabricated Russia, that's all.
There's, by the way, a strange stream of circumstances in the eyes of boys in yellow and blue.
It's the biggest team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the whole village, looking into every corner of the village.
But if you walk, rather than drive, you're going to have a Canadian slag house at the entrance and the recuperator's tent, and a ticket office, and a laundry office, and a dry cleaner, a barber shop, and a flower shop, and a bench with everyday consumer goods, and a mail with unique stamps (only you can't wait for a turn from Chinese philatelicists), and a bank, and a find office, and a photo-kiosk.
Then, late in the evening, you will sit by an olive tree lined with colorful tapes in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who have left this world.
And you're going to come up with a machine that indiscriminately sprays fluids to kill insects, to think about forever.
That's about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village doesn't stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was holding their breath, Australians almost ordered the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know that the news that Inna Derigalova won the gold in the rapier at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got the first one.
Maybe I'm the only Moscow man who saw it happen, except for those who, of course, watched Carioca competitions that night.
Only a real fan can understand that.
Imagine the deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors from the bottom -- as they always do by the time of the night -- wake up and start angry, but cry out loud at each other.
And threatening to move the furniture.
There's no time in the kitchen to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
The TV schedule is unclear, so I was just controlling Mach, First and Russia, although it's almost meaningless.
"Russia" is a family of repetitives, all the sports there for some reason.
There's live TV shows.
Hope, of course, for "Match" -- the whole night, a young man shouted in news stories first about the great semi-final of Derigalova -- Shanaev, then about the coming battle for gold.
That makes sense.
But instead, basketball is the U.S.-Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, and the first half won.
They're putting out of the way the U.S.'s greatness.
As a result, they lost, but as now expressed, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but there's a battle against Dee Francisk, and there's no change on the screen.
I start writing canals in a light panic.
That's the feeling, the second time in a row, they're cool.
All right, let's go into the cables.
There's no fencing on any of the Mother's themes.
Oh, I feel like the fight's about to begin.
Text and Twitter broadcasts on some sports sites don't work for me.
Shipyard surfing produces unexpected but brilliant results.
The First site turns out to be a direct technical broadcast of all the competitions that are taking place at this point in time.
Calling for fencing, getting a gold match.
It's a great counterattack, it's going to go up the glasses, and it's clearly starting to pull time.
It's an Italian who plays almost all the time.
One point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
Dee Franceska throws himself at Deriglezov, but retreats, time's running out, Italians inject.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic ringer reports a fourth gold medal on his phone.
I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
Foolish, loyal, involved.
The Muslim Spiritual Authority (UMM) of Tatar refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM plenary ordered its imams to preach Friday sermons only in Tatar to force young Tatars to “learn their mother tongue”.
The authorities state that this “does not in any way prejudice” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some of the mosques of Kazani, it is reported that the Tatar language does not understand up to 60 per cent of its members, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons at the Tatar "will not reach the entire audience."
Yesterday, the DUM plenary unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic in Tatar only.
As Tuftstan Kamil Samigulin stated, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their native tongue”.
"To those who say that it's heavy, in every great mosque, we intend to organize the Tatar language lessons for no reason," promised Mr. Samigulin.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and today, in all mosques, “should already be in the Tatar language”.
He recalled that DUM Tatarstan published the magazine “Shura” with typical sermons in Tatar.
Imam, who doesn't speak the language well enough, "may well prepare for them."
The Tatar DUM brings together more than a thousand parishes in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the Mufti, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, Kazani used Russian predominantly in a number of mosques.
In particular, as indicated by the Mufti, this has been done in the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabanoi and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhamatshin emphasized that the leadership is responsible for ensuring that all students speak both national languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
“No harm to the non-Tatar Muslims,” said Mr. Muhamatshin, explaining that the sermon itself was “not compulsory, the main part of the namaz”.
In doing so, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will be kept in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "I'm sorry", that there was no serious threat that the Tatar language could be pushed out of mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar other languages, for example Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, sermons in the Republic are not used.
The DUM decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tartar Congress (WCT).
The executive head of the VCT, Rinat Zakirov, said, "I'm sorry": "The Swords are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language could be removed from this field.
He noted that preaching only in Tatar was “the will of the imams themselves”, but that in the executive committee of the VCT “believes it to be correct”.
The Imams interviewed who preached in the Russian Federation were ready to execute the DUM decision, but they believed that the members of the church would have difficulty understanding the clergy.
The mosque is full of Tatars and Russians.
Many people don't understand the language.
Of course, they'll be bored.
"We're going to have to do something about it," says the Imam of the Burnaev Mosque of Farhat Mawletdinov.
According to him, preaching in Russian was closer to even many Tatars, since “Russian is both in schools and in kindergartens, on radio - everywhere in the first place”.
He hoped, however, that the mosque would be able to continue the Russian language classes and lectures held on other days.
We trust in God.
He concluded.
But about 60 percent of us don't speak Tatar.
These are Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
Foreign students come to us a lot: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been translating into Russian for four years," says the imams.
He believes that in the Tatar language, the sermons will be “to reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience”.
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
Just the end result of the sermon will be different.
But time will tell.
"It's only easier for me, for example, because Tatar is my mother tongue," concluded Gabdullah Galileo.
A former Director of the FSIN has been tried
The Moscow Public Prosecutor ' s Office has confirmed the indictment of the criminal case of theft of the Russian FISN budget, investigated by the U.S.S.S.S.S.
The court will be presented with an ex-head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, who caused over 2.7 billion rouble damage to the FSIN.
The Department of the Capital Prosecutor's Office sent a criminal case to the Zamskvoretsk Paradise against the former director of the Russian Federation's FSIN, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy, Nicolai Krivovapov, and the director of the FAPC, Victor Ojevanov, “The Information Technology Support and Liaison Centre of the Federal Penal Enforcement Service”.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused by the UPCS in Moscow under article 285, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code (abuse of official authority with grave consequences), article 159, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (a fraud committed using their official position in an organized group, of a particularly large size).
In addition, Krivovap is charged under article 222, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and possession of ammunition).
According to the 2010-2012 version of the SCR, these individuals fraudulently stole from the State treasury the budget allocated by the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal the budget, the group developed a scheme according to which a CITRO-controlled enterprise with which the relevant government contracts had been concluded had produced technical means of monitoring and surveillance, including electronic bracelets, and had been carried out at prices several times in excess.
Despite the lack of production equipment, buildings, facilities to accommodate the production capacity to create a complete cycle of “electronic bracelets”, five State contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles were concluded between CITROF and the Russian FSIN.
This scheme resulted in more than 2 billion roubles in the accounts of the Samar branch office of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
It is believed that more than 140 million roubles of cash were personally received by Mr. Reimer in his office by a co-partner, for whom a criminal case has been assigned to a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the frauds, was found to have an unknown origin in the ammo to the prize gun, which allowed him to be charged further.
In the case in question, which amounted to 133 volumes, FSIN filed a claim for compensation in the amount of rouble 2.7 billion for the accused.
The football player Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in Putsch.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former football player, followed by a member of Parliament, Hakan Shukur, and searched two of his family ' s houses.
A Turkish football star of the 1990s, the beginning of the 2000s, is wanted by the authorities for the attempted coup d'état of last month.
Forward, who graduated from a sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an “armed terrorist group”.
This is the Khismet movement, a society associated with a prominent Turkish religious figure and opposition, Fechullah Gülen.
It is his President Erdogan who has organized the military coup attempt that took place on 15 July.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media reports, today a warrant was issued for the arrest of Hakan Shukur, and the police have already searched two houses belonging to the family of a former football player.
According to the case, his father also joined the Fethullah Gülen organization in addition to Hakan Shukur himself.
However, neither the former football player nor his family were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a football player, Hakan Shukur protected the colors of several Turkish clubs and advocated a congregated country.
He spent most of his career in Galatasara.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo" and the English Blackburn.
True, he did not spend more than one season in any of them.
Hackan Shukhur is still the most effective attacker in Turkey: 112 matches for the national team and 51 bullets killed.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur resigned from his post owing to the ongoing corruption of the Erdogan party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were arrested on 25 July in Turkey.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and of associating with an opposition Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the United States.
In view of the gravity of the charges, the media can wait for long prison terms ranging from 10 years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would have created a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian movies, which cost two to three times as much tickets as for films of foreign production," he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky noted that Russian films were difficult to compete for viewers with large Hollywood tapes.
We have more than 100 paintings a year in the country, of which an average of 20 to 25 tapes are drawn to screens.
"And even they're very hard to compete with "Transformers" and "The Iron Man," which have huge budgets in their way," said the film director.
We will recall that the All-Russian Youth Education Forum “Tavrida” began its work in Crimea on 1 July.
Participants include art professors and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian backgrounds throughout Russia and from a number of neighbouring and distant countries.
The British won the Olympic gold in a double-dwelled academic dam
The British, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, won the Olympic gold in a double-dwelled academic dam.
The silver was taken by the New Zealanders, Rebecca Scoon and Geneviève Beren, with Anne Anderson and Hedwig Rasmussen from Denmark.
- The new gener promises to hand over Zenit Arena by December 26.
The new Gendarmerie-Gener of the St. Petersburg Stadium, which is to host the 2017 Confederation Cup and the 2018 World Cup, has promised to rent the arena by 26 December, reports RIA Novosti, referring to the Head of the Provisional Commission of the Federation Council for the Preparation of the World Cup for the 2018 Vadima Tulipanov.
"Today, we visited the building with the Russian Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, with us the director of the "Metrostroya" Vadim Alexanderov.
He said he'd take over the stadium by 26 December.
It's a serious Petersburg company, and it's never gonna break the deadline.
Vitalia Mutko and I are satisfied with what we have seen and heard," quotes the interviewer's agency.
In the past, Vitaly Mutko had arrived in St. Petersburg to examine the location of the upcoming large-scale competitions.
Mr. Tulipov also noted that his commission, the Sofeda, would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and would visit the building regularly.
It was recalled yesterday that Metrostra will complete the construction of Zenit Arena, which will cost some 5.4 billion roubles. The same company won a bid to upgrade the territory around the stadium, the contract price is 2.4 billion roubles. The contracts with the Transtra Corporation, the Engineering-Spb Corporation and the Engineering Corporation Transstra have been terminated.
Two more companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.

In Miassa (Celubinsk region), a lawyer from former Vice Governor, Nicolai Sandakova Constantine Akulić, was detained.
Another lawyer for the accused, Sergey Kolosowski, reported that Constantine Akulić had been summoned to the investigation department of the Mikassa in order to bring charges against the one-year-old beating case.
Constantine Akulić then went to the scene as a lawyer to assist one of his participants.
“It was originally brought against unidentified persons; now that it began to defend Nicholas Sandakov, it was found to be Akuliq,” says Sergei Kolosowski.
Constantine Akulić became a lawyer for the deputy governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before counsel was summoned to the Míassa SCR, the defence party was informed that Monday's case file of fraud against Nicholas Sandakova was due to expire.
We will recall that there are two criminal cases against Nicholas Sandakova.
As part of the first (fraud case), he is charged with a promise for 1.5 million roubles to facilitate his appointment as Mayor of the Magnithorsk Head of Administration of Lake Evgeny Tarasov.
The second criminal case concerns a bribe that Nicolai Sandakov allegedly received from the Director of the PRC, Pyton, Igor Kalugin, in the form of an illegal donation of property services of at least 1.3 million roubles.
For more information on Mr. Sandakov's case, read "The former vice-governor needs to join his case."
The Russian Media Company (RCM) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the modernization of one of the country's oldest and environmentally “polluted” enterprises, the Carabas copper combined.
The Carabas copper mill was founded by the English equity society led by Leslie Urkwart in 1910.
During the Soviet era, this was a major industrial enterprise for the country ' s economy, and it actually provided life for an entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, resulting in serious social problems in Karabakh.
A decision was taken in 1998 to resume the work of the Karabas copper combined.
It was also necessary to address one of the main problems of the Karabash plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabach had already been notoriously known as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation in Karabasmeda began to change in 2004 after the enterprise took over the Russian Med Company.
The company has begun to modernize production, which has gradually reduced environmental pressures.
This was noted recently by the Governor of Chelabin province, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited the first issues of July “Carabashmedh”.
The Head of Southern Urala described the enormous changes that have taken place with the enterprise since Karabasmeda moved to the RCM group.
The main modernization activity of Karabaszmeda in recent years has been the construction of a new sulphuric acid plant that captures up to 99.9% of the metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Media Company, the total investment in the project was about 7 billion roubles.
The next phase of the modernization of the Carabasmede is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of three converters, half stickers, and a gas pipeline is planned for the end of 2017.
The project cost 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, it is planned to launch a new industrial run-off facility worth 1 billion roubles by the end of 2016.
In turn, taxes to the city of Karabash will also increase.
During the duration of the project, the Tominsk GOC - from construction to Release 2 - will receive 8.9 billion roubles from the federal treasury.
Once GOC has been put into service, taxes can reach 80.9 billion roubles at all levels.
During the year of production, 346.3 million roubles are allocated to various budgets in the Varen region.
And this is in the first year.
“The longer the enterprise works successfully, the more contributions it can make,” added Valery Ulanowski.
The MFK stated that tax payments from Mikheev ' s GOC had reached 1 billion roubles in 2015.
However, the participation of SRC enterprises in the life and development of the territories of their presence is not limited to tax contributions.
The SRK enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and recreational facilities, and to improve the territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Med Company in Karabasz was a major repair project and, in effect, an almost complete restructuring of N9 kindergarten into 95 teachers.
The building built in 1960 was in emergency condition.
Also located on the territory of RMC Arena will be a landscape park with artificial ponds, underground and underground parking for 600 carpentry areas, cafes and sports shops.
RMC Arena will allow international professional sporting events to take place.
But the main objective of this project is to make exercise and sports comfortable for the people of Chelyabinsk, especially children.

The staff of the Sandholm Refugee Centre in Denmark suspected that the adolescents living there were engaged in prostitution.
This is what The Local reports on Thursday, 11 August.
Some youths, he said, told the agency that “someone in Copenhagen is organizing prostitution”.
According to the publication, doubts about the shelter workers arose after the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan told about similar stories in Malmah.
In 2015, the European Union experienced a crisis as a result of the influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
Denmark has placed more than 20,000 of them on its territory.
On the coast of Cape Cod, U.S.A., a fisherman caught a rare blue lobster.
A man found cancerous among others caught in his underwater trap, reports ABC News.
The American is planning to transfer it to a local oceanic.

Many commended the man for being resourceful and snivelling, while some pointed out that the man was in serious danger of being injured when jumping from his tower because he had placed it at a low depth.
However, one commentator on the Pikabu portal noted that the depth of the sea cannot be judged by the image.

Messingers and postal services must identify users and remove prohibited information - that is the short content of a draft law drawn up by the Media-Community Union (ICU), which unites the largest Russian communication operators (i.e., the “Kidows”).
The staff of the three member companies confirmed that such a project was under discussion.

WSJ: The US is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation because of democracy server hacking.
U.S. officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the invasion of the Democratic Party's servers, writing The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, President Barack Obama ' s administration is said to have to formally accuse Russia ' s servers or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence services are almost convinced of Russia ' s involvement in cyberattack.
WSJ notes that the US usually prefers not to name hacker attackers.
The exception is the hacking of the Sony NES Pictures database in 2014, for which the DPRK was officially responsible.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the imposition of sanctions on those who implement or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process for sanctions can be lengthy, writing out the publication.
Even if officials had concluded that the hackers had acted with Russian support, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They must determine whether the event is so serious as to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that Barack Obama ' s administration allowed sanctions to be imposed against a State whose hackers had broken into the servers of the Democratic Party ' s Nazi Committee.
The WikiLeaks website published an electronic correspondence of the National Committee of Democracies.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in hacking.
In the Kremlin, such reports were considered absurd.
FAS fined Google for almost half a billion rubles
Competition in the mobile application market was the cause.
The antimonopoly trial was initiated at the Yandex initiative.
The Russian company argued that Google provided smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular the Yandex.
The FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position on the market and forced mobile device manufacturers to install other applications together with Google Player.
On the basis of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google by reporting to FAS leader Alexei Docenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
In FAS, it was concluded that all companies, including transnational corporations, must comply with the competition law.
In turn, Google intends to study the solution first and only then determine what to do: execute it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service found the company to be in violation of the competition law as early as September of last year and ordered the adjustment of contracts by 18 December.
However, Google did not agree.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting judicial proceedings.
The FAS noted that despite the fine, the possibility of a peace agreement was being discussed with Google.
This measure will not lead to anything.
The leading analyst Mobile research group, Eldar Murtasin, expressed this opinion.
Murtasin also noted that the fine would not affect either the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

The effect of "Anime" Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon.
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially rude.
The Snapchat tool allows about 150 million users per day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border with absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to set up a picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lins are harsh, distorted instruments that produce more than 30 million corrected salts per day.
Any mistakes are rapidly becoming known.
The Lanses of Snapchat were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising dark skins or encouraging whites to be ideal for beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them indirect eyes, curved teeth and fluffy cheeks, some critics thought it was a racist cartoon on Asians, "yellows."
And they wondered whether these repeated contradictions indicated a more serious diversity-related company problem.
The report on The Verge and Moetoboard, the day after Snapchat announced that they had removed this function, was distributed on Wednesday.
The company commented that the lens was designed as an anime, not an Asian cartoon.
But experts who know about racism are not the only ones who have had the lens to remind them of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others totally rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose portrait tweets were widely shared, said that the lens was “disscencing and at least awkward”.
She added that "it was difficult to argue by comparing side by side with a very rough cartoon on Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not only yellow but highly humiliatingly yellow.
Snapchat is not the only company passing through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from the corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the dweiss that we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- which are more racially diverse than their older generation -- might mean that they are more likely to be understood.
When one of Snapchat's lens creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Cathy Ju, "it's much more difficult to be overlooked than it used to be."
On Thursday, Jo, a product manager and engineer who works on Media, decided to delete her record on Snapchat and called on others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she considered racial contradictions to be causing insufficient diversity in recruitment in Snepchat.
Joo was predominantly critical of the company ' s white management, consisting only of men, and finished with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Jo, who herself is an American of Chinese origin, wrote, "They didn't have enough white people in the state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people, but they don't have jobs where they can speak in a safe and open way."
Other commentators share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of its personnel, but according to the attorney, the company had recently hired a reporter to focus on underrepresented sectors of the population and to actively attempt to attract domestic resources.
For her part, Joo said that she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say it wouldn't work."
Military leadership distorted ISIS intelligence, reporting to Congress Commission
Officials of the U.S. Central Command have changed intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which gives reasons for the situation on the ground, reported to the Congress Commission in a report released on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Republican Chairmen of the Committee of the House of Representatives for the Military Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Sub-Committee on Military Expenditures revealed “widely widespread discontent” among Central Command intelligence analysts who claim that the leaders had subordinated their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as the Centre, is the main military authority in Tampa, Florida, which controls United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence documents approved by the High Command of Centcom generally gave a more optimistic picture of U.S. anti-terrorist actions than the real evidence of the events, and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special services," said the news release on the report.
“What took place in Centcoma is unacceptable: when the senior management submits a false analysis, our military is suffering”, said Ken Calvert, a member of the House of Representatives, a Republican from California.
Management problems in Centcoma reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the shortcomings that have constantly arisen in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although he does not provide definitive evidence that Obama's management has ordered reports to be falsified, he claims that analysts felt that Centcom's leadership forces them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony of the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than actual events,” reported the report.
For example, Centcoma publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, that's certain," said Mike Pompeo, a member of the House of Representatives, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 until mid-2015, the highest intelligence authority of the U.S. Central Command falsified intelligence documents to minimize ISIS's threat in Iraq.
The Republicans established an operational group when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that the intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional pending investigation of the intelligence of the Centcoma is being carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
The representatives of the Democratic Party on the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress published their own data on Thursday, which are consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
“Besides 2014 and 2015, Centcom established an excessively closed procedure for conducting intelligence assessments concerning ISIS and Iraqi security forces”, claims in a statement by the member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, the chief representative of the democratic party on the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, “has stalled intelligence documents”, has prejudiced the morale of analysts and has “not sufficiently reflected differing views”.
But Schiff and the democracies claim to have found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to get their conclusions into a “proposed or political interpretation”.
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were presented on Tuesday by the Daily Beast portal.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of the Pentagon, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in his statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress while the investigation of the Chief Inspector was ongoing.
But he said that “the experts sometimes disagree in the interpretation of integrated data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics of national security”.
The implications of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American bombing in Iraq and Syria has achieved its objectives (as is now the case with more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of intelligence about the Islamic State repeats the controversy over a decade ago when the intelligence analyst Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research article claiming that President George Walker Bush ' s administration, due to the protest of many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think that it would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hucker has also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence workers against the Islamic State.
In the past year, according to officials, Hooker ' s team concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes on oil refineries belonging to the Islamic State had not significantly deteriorated the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil racing plants to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not distributed outside the Central Command, reports the Times of September.
The then commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Ostin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered to be overly optimistic of the war.
General Ossetia resigned in April and was replaced by the Central Command of the Gen. Joseph L. Othel.
The U.S. wins four consecutive times in the women's hockey in the grass, thus approaching a decisive match with Britain.
He once scored three goals in a match, which ended with a 6-1 victory over Japan, Cathy Beam opened the account Thursday with the first two goals for the US Women's Hockey team in the grass, when the Americans won over the India 3-0 team.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Baem, 27 years old, says she's not sure if she'd ever do something like that.
"I won't do it," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who's tracking their goals.
That's what she knows: the American account is 4-0 in the Olympics tournament, and they're competing for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains unconquerable after Japan's losing 2-0 on Thursday.
The British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday at the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim fourths, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their team of six and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid meeting a strong team of rivals from Holland, leaders of another group, a little bit of weather when the fourth-final game begins.
The Saturday game shows, however, that Americans here made noise on their surprise series four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in the London Games.
Bem was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time, with a hockey stick on her grass when she was 3 (her senior twin sisters played this sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16 to become her youngest player in history.
She missed Olympiad 2008, when she didn't go through the final tour.
Then came 2012, when everything went wrong with her and her teammates.
Next year Koig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical training change," said Baem.
In London, we didn't have the kind of productivity that is available right now.
We've completely changed our minds.
On Thursday night, Bem opened an account in the first half of the battle game with an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India went to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team showed up surprisedly rigid and kept score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative.
She made a long passage with a ball down on the left side of the field and then went into the spiral and pushed the ball into the gate, giving the Americans the advantage of 2-0.
Melissa González added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" victory was the first one in the U.S. raffle tournament, Jackie Briggs, who passed one goal at each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
So did Bem.
"We are in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how well it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the dysfunction of the Olympic Games - "dan" jumps on the Battute
Wherever you are, whatever the time, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be constant and inevitable, a violent combination of competitions and aspirations.
It's like the Olympic fire itself, and there's that burning torch that passes from the archer to the float, to the gymnastics, to the triatlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors in line at the cafe, without hearing about Simon Byls, Cathy Ledecki, or about the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Duley.
Dooley, who for the first time participates in the Olympics, a handsome guy with bunks on his cheeks, could well have been among the famous ones shown in prime-time promoted by sponsors and life-supporting commercials if he had been a swimmer, an anthemist or even a fector.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forrest in California fights for gold in the Olympics on the Battute.
The Olympic fire does not cover all events in the same way.
Far further away from the centre, part of the shadows, are sports that are not generally recognized: pneumatic gun shooting, bow shooting, badminton, texwondo.
Brass will always be with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to speak up to defend my personal passions, let me draw your attention to the modest charms of the bautout jumps.
Although the bautoo jumps have been the Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted in Sydney, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not know that they are in the Olympics at all.
That could be regional ignorance.
Even though the United States sent athletes to competitions, they never won medals in the batuette jumps, and their athletes did not go to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russian generally share male awards, while the Chinese and Canadians share female awards.
Dun Don from China and Rose McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But the bautulet jumps have an outsider charm, especially because for unenlightened ears, they are associated with a circus college rather than the Olympics.
I have to admit here that I'm not an expert, I'm only a land enthusiast.
They do have a comical potential — a caricature of endless leaps — but also the beauty of the gymnastics and the leaps in water, the two sports that they mostly combine in themselves.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín", meaning "flooding tramplin in water".
The winners will jump on a giant Battute, taking off almost 30 feet, and must carry out a series of acrobattic tricks (rotation, bends and lettuce) until they finally land on their feet.
They are assessed by performance, complexity and flight time according to the official Olympics programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is ahead.
The medal claimants must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes at the finish, and sometimes back and forth, all over the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the start-up wall, but also, in view of the TV camera, the other point of view: the world record or the Olympic record.
That persistent desire is noble, praiseworthy, even fanatical, and sufficient to make even a viewer climb.
But I think it's a little tired of watching the Games.
He's making the babblings take a break.
The Battutist's direction is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seems like a weightless astronaut, flies up, then down, then without effort again.
And of course they are not without competition or difficulty, but throughout the entire program there is no crazy zeal for the finish line, no leaps in length, only a strange, elaborate disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest Olympic sport to the den.
Women's qualification competitions, and then the finals, will take place on Friday afternoon, broadcast at the hour of the day, Eastern European time; men's on Saturday, also on the hour.
The NBC will broadcast the final of the day programme from 2 p.m. to both days.
In the midst of the Olympics, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can easily be seen in the general dump.
And if increased consciousness can only be achieved by subjecting male athletes to their male preference and objectivity — as Wall Street Journal recently suggested by male gymphony from the United States — Duley is waiting for his newly admired crowd of fans.
A Generation Protests in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Hot Protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators that required political change in Ethiopia faced violent opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally injured during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of division?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months anti-government protests have shocked the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
During the past week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets, demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s reaction was harsh.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video recordings from protest sites allegedly made at the end of the past or early this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they were placed with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Official for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from breaking up, and it will continue to be more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second heavily populated country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
The American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia ' s economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — even a new suburban train in Addis Ababa’s capital.
And her streets are generally quiet, safe, and clean.
However, Ethiopia had hardly been a model of democracy — human rights organizations constantly mentioned government repressions — the opposition in the territory of the State had been suppressed by the fact that dissidents had been effectively silenced.
Many of them have been expelled, imprisoned, killed or expelled to distant deserts.
But it can change.
“If people are constantly oppressed and left with no options other than protest, the rebellion will rise,” said Seyoum Teshome, lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints, ranging from land use to the takeover of power by the government coalition.
Following the widely criticized elections last year, the Government party and its allies totally pushed the opposition out and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are increasing; the struggle for this uncertain, disputed border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden Front for National Liberation, may try to use unrest and re-arms.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings that have been boiling deep inside for several years are now breaking out.
The first seems completely harmless: smartphones.
In the last couple of years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government shuts down Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through proxies, which hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they were organized to protest.
Second, there is greater solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara from predominantly Christian highlands in Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will act together under a single beginning," said Mulata Gemechu, leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which is about 6 per cent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have foreseen danger.
Analytics claim that he was particularly adept at recognizing the first signs of discontent and was using intelligence agents to obtain data and clear opponents.
"The current regime lacks good sense," Abdi said, conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Heilemariam Desalin, appeared out of nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Melesa, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam was a southern man.
Analyticals say he doesn't have the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tiger.
Many fear that this will lead to further bloodshed.
Ethiopia had experienced such unrest for the last time in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said seemed to be elections that the Government had shut down and then falsified.
Many Protestants have been killed in the ensuing repression, although less than in recent months, and this period of unrest has been relatively fast.
The development experts expressed their appreciation to the Ethiopian leaders for the forward-looking development of infrastructure, such as the new intercity train and significant achievements in the fight against poverty.
But it is obvious that this did not stop the growing internal frustration of the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondara, Amhar, attacked Tigray-owned enterprises and the antiTigra hatred on social media was becoming comprehensive.
The analysts claim that the United States and other Western allies are in a bad position.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it has recently announced that it has closed the base.
On the one hand, it was clear that the West wanted to support democracy, but on the other hand, it did not want its ally to lose its strength in an already unstable region.
'And this tight line will be hard to get through,' said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIS was founded by Obama, the "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to replace the latest conflict that had covered his electoral headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were “founders” of an Islamic terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions regarding the ability of the presidential candidate of the Republican Party to approach the American people with discretion.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during times of unrest, in a awkward position, because they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
After making this suggestion at the convention on Wednesday evening, Trump insisted strongly on his Thursday statement, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton had founded ISIS.
But on Twitter, early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just giggling.
The post was the direct opposite of the allegation made just one day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his indictment.
When the Radio Conservator, Hugh Hewitt, tried to help Trump to soften the speech by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the candidate for the presidency of the Republican Party did not take advantage of the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when Trump tried to shift his campaign towards the economy in the face of a lower rating.
Trump and Clinton were competing about the Michigan economy this week.
On Friday Trump tried again to get back to the subject.
Once again, he used Twitter to warn him that Clinton's plans would raise taxes, and he said that he found her speech boring.
Trump's earlier used sarcasm as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he came across a general criticism, practically expressing the idea that Russian should be hacked into Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments and said, "Of course, I'm joking."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permitted in political speech and to take his words back if necessary.
“I think it's his way of testing certain reports that are responding to his worshipers, seeing how they act and then `explaining' them in one way or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who analysed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful about what he says, and he knows that they're vague enough to treat them differently.
Instead of softening the speech for a wide electorate, Trump has taken an even more powerful tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump was giving up Clinton with a high weight in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and was taking her level in Florida.
While Trump usually tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and of not understanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has been the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have put his loyal allies in a awkward position: they must publicly support him, however provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Juliani, the former mayor of New York, who is one of the most famous alternates of Trump, made a serious effort to protect the candidate for the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Juliani when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It's true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown tiny organization, he called it a non-threating, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened because he brought troops out of Iraq.
Most medium-sized Republicans assure that the Obama administration in which Clinton held the post of Secretary of State has allowed ISIS to develop because it has not been able to deal harshly with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania rally on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for emboldening every word and prejudice against him.
He was mocking the poor, unfortunate TV experts who were trying to figure it out, and he said, "They're weak!"
Some democracies ridiculed Trump's justifications as more proof that he was not supposed to be president.
Once an outcast coffee shop goes back to Greenpoint.
The Verbe coffee shop was covered in only cash in Williamsburg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but it served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she's been pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sherry's shop, which took over the Verka in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in the renovated city.
The artist Molly Krabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb's now a soap store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, updating.
The reborn Verb coffee shop opened in November last year in Greenpoint less than a mile north of the original location.
There's Wi-Fi in the new Wi-Fi and they take credit cards, but there's still some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Besides, coffee is still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, an old employee of the old coffee shop who is the owner and general manager in the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to introduce him in a new location, he said that he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, left much behind.
Werb works with the same baigle distributor and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It's got some old "Verb" mirrors in it.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He offered us new dishes.
The menu presents bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches and is available from cappers or roasted onions.
There's some brown rice.
No more beer in the coffee shop, but now fresh juice is made.
Nine months later Rodriguez said that he had drawn attention to the steady flow of old permanent clients.
"Many ex-clients have also been pulled out of Williamsburg," he shared.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Olivier was one such client.
Olivera, who is 34 years old, used to live in Williamsburg and often visited the Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still drove in.
After closing the Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that improvised me in the Verbe," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, though that day instead of the usual i-cafe, she ordered a bottled tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, has been a devoted visitor to the Vreb, beginning in 2003.
He came in front of the office and ordered the same thing.
"At fifteen minutes eight, every day, like an hour, I would come, and for me my buttered bag and all the clothes would be made," he said.
Rodriguez told me he wanted to experiment and put new dishes on the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes a routine order, but one day he changes something with bacon, eggs, or cheese with all the clothes.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended that the soap store once took over an old place.
Moreover, Soup Cheri suggested that special soap be made for "Verb" using cold coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree with their proposal," said Rodriguez.
The residents of the Greenpoints of Polish origin also loved the coffee.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the window to make his new neighbors feel wanted.
There are other benefits to be derived from the new location.
A local juice sales point plans to spill bottles and sell cold coffee.
The coffee shop is likely to be joined by a neighboring building.
For many clients, it's enough that a new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and said he was killed in grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new location, Whitt said that when he entered and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he were home.
"How long I've wanted to smell it," he admitted.
Depressant Food for Depression in the "Fly Feeding"
In March 1933, shortly after his accession to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to have lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashionable dishes of Fifth Avenue, such as the Fua Grai and the Meriland Turtle Soup.
His menu on that day was much more modest — the stuffed eggs in the tomato sauce, the potatoes, and the dessert pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Cow, added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in food history.
The last book of Koua, "Ragu in Chinese," was devoted to a Chinese kitchen in America, and Ziegelman told the story of life in a family apartment in Lower East Side through food in her book "House 97 in Fruit Garden Street."
Their new collaborative work "Front Cake", which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some of their own cooking solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, simple restaurant in Flateyron District, which has been operating since 1929, the year of Birge's collapse.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a plumbing cheese and a sandwich of olives, while Coe, 57, took an turkey, potatoes, and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple thought it was an appropriate starting point for discussion of food during the depression period.
"The Rollets were in great demand," said Ziegelman.
There was a peanut roulette, a liver roulette, a legume.
They were made from a major ingredient and low-cost products that allowed the ingredient to stretch out.
Imagine you ate as much peanut as you need for dinner.
Kou's squirting.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years leading up to depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women prepared for male farm workers, and freshly prepared cakes were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans," said Coe, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
A new budget diet was equally difficult: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and bakeries, became basic foods; bakery was a “precious way to dispose of the food,” said Ziegelman, “because the cook could hide non-appetite ingredients under a dense layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dry fruit.
The meat, which has been the basis for American food for many years, has become economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching a book that includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era: baked onions, prepared with peanut butter.
"This addition to the lunch table was not successful," Kow said.
Ziegelman added, "It was very strange."
Peanut butter doesn't fit the baked bow at all.
This has been the case with many homemade prescriptions.
More than ever before, domesticists — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Economics Bureau from 1923 to 1943 — managed the food habits of the country.
By publishing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budgeters”, to accept the challenge and to turn a brand like protein spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"Front table" is a quirk of interesting historical facts.
The stories of the government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's attitude in the spirit of eating pies, are particularly pictorial.
In public pride of the simple Iowa farm foot when he was a child, he was fed like a sophisticated millionaire who became.
"He liked a continental kitchen, like a fish with cucumber sauce," Kow said.
He ate almost in a gold dining-room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically out of reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set the example of his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy that was completely uninterested in taste, and this led to the White House 'using not only the most exhausted food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared.'
Many of the cooking techniques of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Ziegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
They tell us that at the time of writing, they had a better understanding of her mother’s eating habits — that she could not throw away food, such as food.
"She was seriously afraid of being careless about food," said Cow.
Ziegelman recalls, "She's seriously poisoned people."
There was one unpleasant case of profilers.
When the plates in Eisenberg's deserts, they and Coe got desserts that they had prepared at home: black dessert, which President Roosevelt ate for dinner.
"It's called a blacksmith muss," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common reception--to give modest prescriptions broiled names.
There were no plums, only plums, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to drop the spoon into a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
To my surprise, it was not bad.
Koe asked for additions twice.
With the voice of a confident budget maker, he said to his wife, "A few rubles of Greek nuts wouldn't stop here."
The arrest of the figures in the mass fight at the Khovan cemetery was extended until 14 November.
The Press Court left the case of mass fighting in the Khovan cemetery until 14 November, granting the request for investigation.
In the case of accused persons, 14 persons are involved.
We will recall that on 14 May, several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus suffered a massive arms fight at the Khovan cemetery, killing three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev, and the lawyer, co-founder of the Health Nation, Alexander Bocharnik, was charged with organizing the murder.
The question of the second in 2016 of the pension indexation could be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported by the Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation, Olga Holotz, on 12 August, during his visit to the Bryansk region.
We have set specific parameters on how much the pension needs to be increased in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
The economists are taking stock of the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work in the next two or three weeks," quoted the Food Interfax.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the Head of the Centre for Strategic Development, Alexei Kudrin, to raise the retirement age by six months each year, the Vice-Prime said that the subject was not addressed in the chimney.
At the end of July, it was reported that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexing of pension benefits in 2017.
Kamensky and Grygorian went to the finals of the small-calibre rifle fire competitions.
The Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Cyril Grygorian took a final shot at a small-calibre rifle from their position at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and ranked first, the new Olympic record in qualifications.
Cyril Gregory was the second -- 628.9 was.
A total of eight top athletes went to the final.
Kamensky is a world recordr in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition Fechullah Gülen requires an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d ' état in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d'état”, quoted Gülen as the French newspaper Le Monde.
Also, the Turkish opposition stated that “if some of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey”.
However, Gülen strongly denies involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court had previously arrested an opposition Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen, in absentia.
Recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilaad will be reimbursed for legal services during the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to receive compensation for the costs of legal services it has incurred in connection with its claim for a hepatitis C patent with Merck & Co Inc drug manufacturer, which was decided by the Federal District Judge.
In June, Gilead was released from payment of $200 million for breach of Merck ' s two patents relating to the medicine of Gilaad, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harwoni, after an American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including a lie under oath and other non-ethical acts.
On Thursday, a U.S. federal court judge, Beth Labson Freeman, said that Gilead was entitled to reimbursement for the costs incurred during the challenge.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can cure more than 90 per cent of liver patients.
The case took place in 2013 when Gilaad and Merck filed a lawsuit against each other, claiming their right to laboratory work, which was the basis of the sophosbuir, an active ingredient in the medicine of Gilead.
U.S.-supported armed forces claim to have intercepted full control of Manbage from the Islamic State
The U.S.-supported armed forces took full control of the northern town of Manbidge near the Turkish border, after the last Islamic State militia remaining in the city had left, a group representative reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SLM) are now cleaning up the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militia, informed Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the Allied Military Council of Manbidge.
"The city is now under our full control, but we are doing clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax declarations on Friday, which showed that the democratic candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in honorariums for speaking, and the former Secretary of State announced a $3 million income from Simon & Schuster for her book on her career in the State Department.
Potential Vice-President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, together with his wife Anna Holton, has issued tax declarations in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard for financial transparency," said the adviser to the election staff of Clinton Jennifer Palmiery.
In complete contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and violating his past promises to publish his tax declarations.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not required by law.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers described the check of the State Tax Service as the reason for his refusal to publish his tax declarations.
"Your turn," wrote Twitter counselor to Clinton Jan Sams for election staff, referring to the declaration of the candidate for the democratic party.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them before the end of the checks.
Trump's critics, including Mitta Romney, a candidate for president of the Republican Party in 2012, and other Republican fellow citizens, said that his refusal raised questions about his status, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other relations, including with Russia.
Clinton took hold of this question and released an online video on Friday that focused on the great Republicans who convinced Trump to make the tax report public.
On Thursday, she raised this question during a talk on the Michigan economy.
“He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception to the presidential candidate for decades: publish his tax declarations,” she said to the audience.
Politicalo reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes in the two years of the 1990s, and a business columnist for the New York Times quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday as saying that it might still be happening.
Federal tax rates were the subject of a dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire, an investor named Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year will pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska State, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he's under IRS inspection, too, and that Trump's afraid is not a tax agency but an electorate.
Clinton's electoral headquarters has issued tax declarations up to 2007.
Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective cumulative tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration of 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost Paea Index Fund, and the Clintons announced dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Pulverized chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania use a nontraditional way to prevent elephants from entering human settlements by throwing chili powdered condoms into them.
The method was effective, and Honygiude Foundation, which came to mind a few years ago, along with the American Committee for Nature Protection, took over its promotion by training volunteers in northern Tanzanian villages to use a non-violent, four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many used to use a spear to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have invented a set of tools... we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, which has made them much more confident that they will not let elephants into their fields without harming elephants," said the Executive Director, Honygiude Damian Bell.
The first two steps are to light the torch before the breaking elephant and signal the horn.
If he fails to be scared, they throw away the so-called Chili cloud.
A chili powder mixed with soil is placed with a cotton in a condom, and its end is rolled, and only the phytil is left outside.
When the condom is lit, it bursts with a groove, spraying a small dust of chili powder in the air.
One thought is usually enough to turn the elephant the other way.
The extreme measure is a launching device that shoots Roman candles into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
The 32 Turkish diplomats who had left Turkey since the coup attempt in July of this year have not yet returned to Turkey.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevlut Tchavushoglu, provided such information in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we withdrew 208 staff diplomats to continue their work in the centre.
Of these, 32 have not returned without objective reasons or explanation,” said the head of the Turkish foreign policy department.
Recall that an attempted coup d ' état took place in Turkey in July.
The authorities officially announced that the coup d ' état had failed, as well as the detention of more than 6,000 people, including senior and middle-level military officials.
As a result of attempted coup d ' état, according to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 290 people were killed.
The Jewish director strongly criticized the Berlin Hotel for removing the Israeli phone code through Arab “requests” — reported RT News
A French director of Jewish origin launched a scandal in the media, discovering that the Campinski Bridge in Berlin did not have an Israeli telephone code list, with Arab clients referring to “requests”.
Claude Lanzman, author of the documentary on the Holocaust of the Shoa, expressed his dissatisfaction at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, wrote an open letter to the German FAZ media.
During his recent stay at the Lanceman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, had not been mentioned among the States where it could call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was expelled and destroyed?
He wrote Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bridge provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own call centre.
In search of explanation, the director raised this issue on the hotel administration desk.
The answer he received there, according to Lanceman, "has hurt him."
Klerk of the hotel said that this measure was "an informed decision by the Kempinski hotel network manager."
The reason behind this step was further anger from the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the code of Israel be removed," said Lanzman, serving the hotel.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a “terrorous shame”, reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
That it happened in Germany, and that's exactly what this hotel network is, it's even more shameful.
You don't need an explanation here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident caused a lot of impact on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel was simply “about” to the alleged claims of Arab clients.
"We would be ashamed," said another post, stating that a hotel located on the famous street of Kurhurstendamm was located near the synagogue.
The hotel itself was in a hurry to retract any charges, calling the incident “in police custody” and “apologizing” to the Lanceman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the list of rapid recruitment," quotes the representative of the Kempinski Hotel as the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students protesting
The students met with the police in the Brazilian town of São Paulo on Thursday, when they met to protest against the Government's reforms of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The disorder began when the police tried to disperse the students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in a demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
As proposed by the Governor of the State of São Paulo, Heraldo Alkkmin, almost 100 State secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some of the protesters could be seen on the wall of the Grafiti against the Acting President Michael Thamer.
This last protest took place only a few days after the protesters had gone out on the streets to support President Dilma Russef, who had been separated, when the country's Senate voted in favour of her impeachment.
Russian-Iranian trade increased by 71%, with the RT Business portal
With the lifting of the sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Lewan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in interest on the part of Russian firms in the conduct of business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” said Jagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, Russian-Iranian trade grew by 70.9 per cent from the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increased trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” said the Ambassador.
Jagarian also predicts that Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also entered the top 20 countries for the first time in terms of the number of visitors to Russia.
It can be said with confidence that last year’s record of the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken, ” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yez, which retain the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
The State continues to roll nuts in the defence and industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the director of the company Almaty-Anthey, the “loss of work” and the “lost of confidence”.
Hennadiy Bendersky has been appointed leader of NGOs for the next three years.
Information about Neskorodov ' s dismissal was not available until Thursday evening and did not generate widespread media coverage.
How can such silence be explained in the context of a major rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not wish to disseminate any rumours or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This confirms once again that the defence and industrial complex (PAC) has many problems and that the State does not wish to attract social attention to them.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important development in terms of industrial order.
The NGO Almaty is the main concern of the company, which specializes in the production of marine and ground-based air defence systems.
Almaz is currently working on the establishment of the Police Reduth and Morfei APC, which is planned to be installed for new corvettes, frigates, esmines and cruisers.
The founder of the Military russian Portal, Dimitri Cornev, believes that Neskorodov ' s dismissal is due to delays in the time frame of these projects.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the “Morpheus” was under development as early as 2007 and was expected to be operational in 2013.
The "Policy Reeds" should become the basic air defence system on the latest Navy ships.
According to the information I receive, no truly successful test has been carried out over the years.
The truth is, as far as I can tell, it's not the clear fault of Almaz,' said Cornev.
The expert fears that the late entry into service may also occur with the C-500 DRC.
The design and development of the project has not yet been completed, but the first complexes should be deployed in 2016.
In the Ministry of Defence, “the work is planned and will be completed on time”, although the agency recognized problems with the development of the P-500 in 2014.
It is extremely difficult to assess Neskorodov's qualifications as head of Almaty since 2011.
Kornev noted that delays in project time could be both a cause and a reason for dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on domestic processes in the CPC and on enterprise management plans.
The industry has received long - term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large amounts of money are known to love silence.
In general, the directors of the defence companies leave their posts at their own discretion, under the agreement of the parties, or are transferred to other jobs.
In the present case, the suspension took place in public, although it was not resonated.
This suggests that the Almaty leader may have been a figure of stratagem and opposed the "discretions" coming from above.
This seems to be no longer the State’s intention to tolerate such conduct.
By the hands of shareholders, it will disqualify those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence and fail to perform the tasks assigned.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation is seeking to punish incoming managers (machings on the Zweda shipyard).
The President has paid greater attention to the problems of the sector in person.
Vladimir Putin is the head of the Military Industrial Commission and holds periodic meetings on rearming.
The Kremlin protects the management of the CDC in an effort to have at its disposal a loyal staff of directors who will comply with orders received from above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but against the background of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the CPC, there are no other instruments of the State.
The prevailing situation in defence is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces under control as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of managers in the KCP, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to enhance the professionalism of the Russian forces.
The army has acquired a new quality with the assumption of the post of Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoigu.
The President seems to have adopted a famous saying, "Wishing for peace - prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military might of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established the influence of Moscow on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked well.
The absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East proved that.
The triumph of “conquerors” in the cold war ultimately led to the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States, there's probably no safe corner left in the civilized world.
Despite the general problem, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the Navy and the army.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to defend national interests more effectively and to reach the new stages of global policy.
Scotchman Kallum Skinner runs on the finish line, resulting in the capture of bicycle gold by the British
Scotsman Kallum Skinner was racing for a triumph in the male crew sprinte on a bicycle in Rio last night, which resulted in the British Command Trio defending her title from London in 2012.
A 23-year-old Glasgow was one of the strongest people his Scottish friend, Sir Chris Hoy, had made his own, and the young man proudly entered history by running down the finish line to win a victory at the New Zealand Fatorite team.
Britain claimed the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed the right to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they finished modestly sixths at the March World Cup on a track bike in London, despite the fact that Hoi has since completed his career.
The question between Beijing and London was to replace participant Jamie Staff.
They did exactly as long as the Winds appeared.
Hoya's departure also created the void that Kean Emadi and Matt Krampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man followed by British coaches, seeing potential in a Scottish who had now been realized.
Hindez, Kenny — champions with Hoi four years ago — and Skinner set the Olympic record in qualifications, but the standards were surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British Trio won a duel for gold.
Hindez was exactly behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported it.
The change in strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindez was driving more to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoi observed from his seat as an invited BBC expert and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hindez when they entered the pedestal.
A 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a flattery comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can and make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindez deliberately fell on the track after a failed start.
He later retracted the comment and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindez said, "I felt like I was in London with all those British flags at the rostrum."
We've all met like a team in the last three months.
We were playing so many races with the world name that winning the Olympics was amazing again.
It's one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of 10 race names in both Beijing and London.
If it's a barometer of progress over the last five months, then five more successful days are expected.
With the form shown by Kenny, it's not beyond the opportunity to imagine how he repeated Hoya's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in the same Games.
That would allow us to see Kenny, who was 12 years younger than Hoya, who was born on March 23 (that seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgray, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister), bring his account to six gold medals and one silver.
That would be like Hoi's.
The next time, Kenny competes in a sprinte that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this right now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindez said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must have a knightship."
It was the only one in a day playing medals, but there was next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancey, Stephen Burke and Owen Doll are the fastest four-kilometre four-kilometre track race.
They finish at 3:51.943.
The world record for gold winning in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be the focus of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, the day before the qualification visit, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In an appropriate women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanne Rosell Sand, Eleanor Barker and Cathy Archibald of Milngavi improved the world record by showing time of 4:13,260.
The British Command has come to rely on a powerful cyclist team to take possession of the medium period of the Olympic Games and earn a lot of medals.
Following in fact the exceptional demonstrations of total superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas at the second level, not least the withdrawal from the post of Technical Director, Shane Sutton, in April, because of allegations of sexism and harassment, and withdrawals of large figures, such as Hoi and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first evening race on the bicycle, it seems that Britain’s legendary glory in reaching its peaks at the right time may seem to be repeated again.
The future of the Portland steel plant is threatened by the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Victorian Portland aluminium plant — as well as hundreds of workers — is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one factory owner, is about to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all contracts of supply will be terminated.
This step is a consequence of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed grant expires in November for 20 years.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be threatened by Alcoa's factory in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the steel mill consumes about 10 per cent of all Victorian electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down a steel plant at Point Henry, which led to the closure of the Engles plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland Metallurgical Factory loses money and risks closure.
These actions resulted from reflection on the future of the plant, which had been continuing for several years, initially owing to the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later due to the price of the factory ' s products.
AGL, which provides a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Young A power plant in Latro-Wally, reported that it was expected that the other three owners would also take steps to avoid the contract.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the joint short-term enterprise of Alcoa and Almine, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own less shares.
“The AGL campaign expects the Portuguese facility to continue working, i.e. the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called “hedged contracts” that were due to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month period of termination, so they will actually end in 2017.
“AGL is, therefore, still expecting these contracts to generate their share of income in fiscal year 2017,” the electricity company stated.
Whatever the potential impact on AGL profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited by projections of a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts by $187 million in terms of “pre-dissolution”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect Alcoa's ability to manage the steel factory or to provide electricity to the steel factory”.
An American company stated that in 2010 it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Young, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it still had to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analytics feared the possible closure of both the Victorian Portland Metallurgical Plant and the Tomago Factory near Newsweek because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Turning to analysts earlier this week, AGL's Chief of Operations, Stephen Mickelsen, said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy a year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts a year.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in the demand for [electric power].
It would be bad for us as a producer," he said.
Not only is the reality show Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of September Vālā
Kendall Jenner, 20, the model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner Mother Chris, appeared on the cover of the American magazine Vā.
Kendall, who is the face of the Este Lauder brand and has defiled fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news in his account in Instagram on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my favorite people, I looked at the cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The cover story was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the Kardashian Family?) reality video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the Deboshire Rob and Caitlin, who also joined them, the universal favorite uncle of the show business, the producer of the Kardashian family, Ryan Sikrest), forgot the appearance of the sister on the cover and, in the end, the classic turn: they planned a party-surprise.
It's a standard plot line for almost every episode of children's television show dedicated to birthday (Sixrest says, "You thought we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in the program at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed this glory to get to other girls in one way or another.
Because with this episode dedicated to September's Vālā, we certainly entered the new era of the Kardashian show.
Let Senior Sister Kendall Kim get on the cover of the Vālā earlier (she appeared on the cover with her husband, Kanye West, in April 2014), but September’s cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the most marketed Vāta of the year.
It is more like a gift publication than a fashion magazine, and it attracts a large number of advertisers. (Fashionista portal accounts for 615 pages of last year ' s 832-page magazine.)
The news about who gets on his cover is so much expected that during the last two years, photos of this magazine have merged into official anons.
The previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has certainly been more "nomenities that work as models" on the cover than "models that are famous".
The Oscar laureate and the face of the brand Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, a year after the honor was paid to Lady Gague.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, described by the magazine as the "extraditional model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
They are not relatives of prominent people, reality-show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
They're really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonse, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful career stories of Lemonade's album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner’s success.
The position of Jenner in the fashion world, because of her past television reality star, was always supposed to be shaky.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seimur criticized Jenner and her colleague, Jiji Hadid, called them "momentary bitches".
These moods rekindled after the news of Jenner's appearance on the Vampo cover.
But there's no point in getting upset.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of September's Vogue.
It is a supermodel in every sense.
She defils for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you a tonal cream from Estie Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you their photos in their own application, available on a paid subscription.
She sells her own photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she's engaged in a reality show on television.
Public legal centres refuse services of 160,000 people per year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the least protected people are denied services in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an effect that will further reduce funding for existing activities to the limit.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly older persons, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people unable to combat unfair deprivation of property, and so on — have already been denied free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside the scope are preparing for further reductions.
Since June of next year these legal centres should lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queensland’s Public Legal Centres, said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people have been denied a year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision was not reversed, the situation would only deteriorate.
“The Queensland public legal centres are constantly receiving insufficient funding: that means thousands of people are denied essential services to them,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and destructive debt, families who are divorced, who are unfairly dismissed workers -- all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government would reduce funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which meant that thousands of less protected people in Queensland would have to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland, George Brandis, to cancel these reductions immediately so that people can receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to address the needs of public legal centres and communities and their clients, and it is time for the Palashuk Government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was taken to court after a staff member allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's electoral headquarters was brought before a court: it is alleged that the headquarters did nothing after he was reported that his operations director in North Carolina threatened the staff member with a gun while they were driving to the jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court case filed on Wednesday with the State Court in Charlotte Vinzent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state electoral headquarters.
Bordini said he'd been waiting months for the problem to be resolved internally, but he realized "this isn't gonna happen."
Director Earl Phillipe, "sudden the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the gun at Vincent's knee cup," so claims Bordini in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional office of the electoral headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more persons had been involved in similar incidents with Phillips, the appeal had been filed.
"Pistols don't have to shoot to hurt," said Bordini in his complaint.
The action took place only two days after a candidate for the President of the Republican Party presented a furor, telling North Carolina's listeners that the “Second Amendment” — understood as arms owners and lovers — could begin to operate if his rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected and could choose judges.
Trump's elective headquarters said that his words had been pulled out of context by the media and that he had not expressed his support for violence.
In his complaint, Bordini seeks compensation from the electoral staff for negligence of control and from Philippe for the threat of physical violence, assault and moral harm.
The representative of Trumpa Hope Hicks was slow in responding to a request for comment.
Attempts to speak with Philip did not succeed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the electoral headquarters.
In response to the call to his consulting firm, the Innovation Advisory Services, no one called quickly.
The presidential candidate for the Republican Party, Donald Trump, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Division of the Higher Court of Meklenburg District (Sharlott).
Britain needs to put the Olympic spirit in its proper place and expand the Hithrow
It will also bring renaissance and prosperity, not only in our localities and in London as a whole, but throughout the country.
In my view, this was the great advantage of Hithrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympic Games have greatly benefited Stratford and East End.
And we're going to do that again by creating opportunities for local residents and firms next to Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As was the case in London 2012, there will be those who think the challenge of expanding Hithrou is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we would find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they'll be proved wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hithrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Hithrow Olympic Games, it is an infrastructure project for most, not just for the narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving behind the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent team in Heathrow that has implemented a programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in time and within the budget, from T5 — the top airport terminal selected for five consecutive years, to T2 — built in the middle of the two world's largest runways.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success for the British, and I'm sure the expansion of Hithrow will also be.
The time has come for us to put the Olympic spirit on track and expand the Hithrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a legacy of the skills and employment that Britain can take pride in.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Hithrow Council and former Trade Attasha Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays "mouse cats" about blocking advertisements
For companies that earn money on the Internet ads, trying to bypass advertising software is a game of mouse cats, according to one company that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block ads on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus published a blog entry that users could update their filters in the program to block the ads again on the social media.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the website's desktop version was changing the ceiling around its commercials to make it more difficult for advertisers to recognize what parts of the page were advertising.
But Adblock now says he could bypass the new code.
In his blog, Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open-source advertising community and those trying to get around it continues from the moment the advertising block was invented," and Facebook may be presenting its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has entered the fight is a clear indication of the extent to which advertising blockers have become a major problem for industry.
Around the world, some 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to last year ' s study of the page years and Adobe; almost four times as many of those who used such software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion active users who use mobile devices on Facebook every day, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is after the blockers on the desktop version because mobile blockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile applications for social networking and Instagram, according to the representative.
Still, the ad in the desk version is a fairly profitable article to make Facebook think of this as a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday Facebook announced that it was going to update its tool of “advertising preferences” to give people more control over how they were offered advertising.
On Thursday Facebook said that the new Adblock filters were a matter of concern, as they would also block some non-advertising content on the website.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we are planning to solve this problem," stated Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertisers are a rough tool, so instead we've focused on creating tools like Advertising Preferences to put governance in the hands of people.
Women moved on the Swiss highway in a self-evident suicide episode
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police called on witnesses after a woman had moved several vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in an apparent attempt to commit suicide.
The incident took place on A1 near Morge in the canton of Vaud immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman went on a road in the dark with a gesture of despair and was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
In a clear attempt to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police have informed them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated, a “logical” step in such a situation, and counsel Gile Hofster Le Tribune de Geneve stated.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
This is what the prosecutor has to decide, ” Hofster said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both involving a person walking in the dark on a highway — it was sentenced that motorists could not expect to encounter a pedestrian on a midnight highway, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on A1 near Peyern last night in August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim drank and fainted on the road, heard the court.
The Court found that the woman police officer — who responded to the emergency call — was driving the vehicle the way it was justified, and that the existence of a person on the road was “exclusive and unpredictable”, said the judge.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday near Morge must call the 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may once have been inhabited by an estimated new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Moscow Institute for Space Research, Goddard, developed a model for the study of Venus's past, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions similar to those of Earth could ever exist on Venus, with its hot waterless surface and its atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide.
Scientists had previously assumed that Venus’s small rotational speed was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a decomposed atmosphere similar to that of the earth and still have a slow rotation.
The model also examined the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than there were on Earth, but once there was enough water and sufficient geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early days of Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent more bushel.
"In accordance with the GIS model, Venus's slow rotation puts it on its daylight side for almost two months at a time," explained the GISS scholar Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
It heats up the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella protecting the surface of the planet from a significant part of the sun’s heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are surprisingly a few degrees colder than they are today on Earth.
The model shows Venus’s history, similar to that previously thought of by planet scientists.
Although Venus may once have been inhabited, she has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans have been evaporated and her water vapor has been burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogens flew away, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide, with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model, Venus, in the magazine Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves the trainer for the Avalanche team
Patrick Roy resigned from the post of coach and vice-president of Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the team ' s decision-making process.
The Executive Vice-President-General of the Colorado team, Joe Sack, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have served as Chief Coach and Vice-President of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in her statement.
During the summer, I spent a long and diligent time thinking about how I could improve this team in order to give it the depth it needed and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve that goal, the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey activities must perfectly coincide with that of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sachik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
" Patrick informed me of his decision today," said Sack.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy became Jack Adams Award winner as the best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He brought the club to 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado was destroyed by Minnesota in the first round of the game-off and lost the play-off for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind the Wild team in the fight for a second soft trip to participate in the Western Conference.
The gatekeeper from Hall of Fame, Roy, won the Stanley Cup, two from the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oilers resume negotiations and suspend the strike
Working strikes on the North Sea salaries have been suspended and all parties to the discussion are embarking on a new round of negotiations, with the leading representatives of the parties.
The strike against the oil service company Wood Group was irregularly organized on platforms in the North Sea under Royal Dutch Shell.
“The Wood Group and Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes”, says the joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, to look at the problems with a fresh look.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, had been directed against potential salary reductions of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group this year reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by some 9 per cent owing to the negative market tensions.
The lower rates on the company ' s part occurred after a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for contract employees working on the bank in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts would give it the space necessary to overcome the decline in the market.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries up to 10 because it rationalizes its activities due to its mega-slience with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower prices of crude oil: the economic situation deteriorated because of the decision to withdraw from the European Union in June by the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts in the North Sea of our time.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said.
Less than $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected to be in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of the stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers to gather the fullest possible catalogue of star speeds from the Pleiades cluster.
New data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds and how the rotation periods relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," explained in a press release by Louise Riball, a scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiades collection is 445 light-years from the Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They spin as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak speeds, these adult stars throw out large amounts of star wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds are slowing down on the stars.
As the stars grow older, their speed begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between recognized star spots, such as the sun’s stains.
The newer directory of rotational speeds suggests that the more massive stars rotate slower than the less massive stars.
The fishermen compare the stars with the dancers. The larger ones make the pyruates slower than the smaller ones.
In the "Balet" of the Pleiades, we see that those who rotate slowly, usually more massive, whereas those who rotate faster, usually refer to very light stars," said Riball.
Since Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare star properties with rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades Star Collection provides a starting point for theoretical models of star rotation, both younger and older," said Riball.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why stars slow their speed and hang their dance shoes on their nails, so to speak.
Fishall and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the speed of Pleiades in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
An investigation into the activities of a group of detainees in Crimea of Ukrainian saboteurs is conducted by two departments, “Commersant” writes.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of diversions in Crimea.
As previously reported, a resident of Energodar Eugenius Panov, Ukraine, who had accepted cooperation with the investigation gave a confession.
He said that he viewed the Titan chemical plant in Armenia, the oil base in Theodosia, the Kerchen ferry transport, the gas pipeline and one of the military airfields as diversion facilities.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all diversions have been arrested.
This, among other things, led to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Paradise of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanisław Cherchezov was the main coach of the prefabricated Russia.
At a meeting of the executive committee of the Russian soccer Union, a decision was taken to appoint Stanislav Cherchezov as the main coach of the prefabricated Russian football company.
It will be contracted for two years, until the end of CMM-2018.
On 11 August, an executive of the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchezov as the main coach of the Russian national football team.
He was a famous football player who had played Moscow's Spartake at the position of the raffle, and also a coach with solid experience who had been a mentor of Russian teams such as Spartacus, Zhemchus-Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dinamo, and Warsaw Lagiya, who had won the national primacy and the cup of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchezov will be signed as soon as possible for a period of two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare for the World Championship in 2018.
Miroslav Romashenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov, is known to be part of his coach headquarters.
There are indications that the entire training staff will pay 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation has set Stanislav Cherchezov a goal of bringing the Russian Federation together to semi-finals and winning medals.
As the coach himself has said, he considers the creation of a competitive team environment as a priority and intends to give football players an opportunity to show themselves.
He is also glad to have a choice, he says.
The first match, led by Churchsov, will be held by Russia on 31 August in Antala, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Recall that Leonid Slutsky, who had joined him as a coach at the CCCA club, had previously served as the leading coach of the Russian football team.
He declared his resignation following a proactive presentation by the Russian national team on Euro 2016 in France.
However, he took responsibility for the bad result of his collection.
In the struggle between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990, that country, with a population of 2.4 million, has made tremendous progress, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government is paying great attention to education.
While people in developed countries perceive free primary and secondary education as their own free life, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary school fees are required.
Moreover, Governments are often encouraged to introduce fees for “cost recovery”.
In Namibia, however, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has been free.
The authorities are also active in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Contrary to the international trend of inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
As compared to 1993, the Gini ratio, the standard indicator for income inequality, has dropped by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also decreased, from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rate of freedom of expression in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The United States and other rich States have far outstripped the country.
Moreover, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the “Encouragement of Corruption Index”, which is composed of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even at a time when commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least in traditional assessment methods, remains high - nearly 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS infection - nearly 17 per cent of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is one of the upper middle income countries, but the authorities insist that their State is indeed a developing country.
Namibia is no doubt facing some of the difficulties inherent in the underdeveloped economies.
The State has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
The country ' s deserts are inhabited by isolated nomadic hunter-person tribes, which must, in one way or another, be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
The integration of people who a quarter of a century ago were marginalized in the world economy is a challenge for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: just like any other country in the world, it faces the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia had not thought of giving up, and the country was addressing its problems.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a united society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
In fact, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
Nobody in Namibia talks about building a wall that separates the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that their neighbours did not choose but decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate to share scarce water resources, participate in regional health projects, encourage investment and exchange of students.
Moreover, the Namibian Government has rightly judged that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that Namibia's natural wealth revenues need to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum return on the country ' s resources and are revising investment laws and mining contracts to ensure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial for this process, and strong Government support for freedom of speech is therefore important.
According to the Head of State, Hague Heingob, the media often say things he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has received, said the President.
Not all key resources in Namibia are exhausted.
Some - such as fisheries - were renewable, and the Government was making every effort to maintain and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia shows that even countries that are beginning with serious shortcomings - racism, the colonial order, inequality and underdevelopment - can embark on the path to general prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and follow-up.
Many have heard of "Golden Varna", the oldest gold objects ever created by man (400 - 4,200 B.C.E.).
It must have been the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, an excavation of the Varnen Necropolis found a fantastic number of golden artifacts -- more than three thousand times the total weight of six kilograms.
From only one grave, known as "Mighty No. 43", 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg were recovered.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold may soon be changed to the unseemly shape of the bush found by archaeologists in July of this year.
Again in Bulgaria, a pre-historic settlement known as Tell Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunacyté is located far from the sea near the village of Unacyté of the Pazardzik district.
The Bush is a golden striped in a ring.
Javor Bojadjiev, the director of a excavation at Telly Junacyt, dated the find to 4,600 years before our Common Era and claimed that it was at least 200 years older than the gold of Varna.
The treasures of Barnabas, we will recall, date from about the same period, 4,600 - 4,200 B.C.E.
There is currently no technology to allow the accurate dateing of the metal.
How can you be sure that gold is more ancient?
Professor Boyajiev obviously knows more than he told Reuters: "I'm pretty sure the young man's gold is older than the gold of Varna."
It's a very important find: it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Boyajiev, scientists will soon analyse the composition of the metal as well as re-examine the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
It'll help to date the bush with as much precision as possible.
The site also explains a lot.
Unacite Tel is a famous settlement, even though you've never heard of it.
At present, Tell Yunacite is considered to be the oldest “city” in Europe.
The Tel was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia, modern Turkey, in the millennium before the Common Era.
During the centuries that followed, metal processing, from developing the first metallurgical skills to developing a full-fledged industry, was rapidly developing in the region.
The national history for this archaeological community has a special name: the Balkans-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In the 5,000th century before our Common Era, urban settlements began to emerge around metal-processing centers.
They are now known as Europe’s oldest cities.
Of these, Tell Yunacite may be the oldest, since artifacts were found here in the year 4900 before our Common Era.
I'd call Tell Yunacita a prototype of the modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This place is a thousand years older than Sumerian,” says Boyajiev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
The first cities were formed there in a common sense.
The Tel Yunacite has been excavationd since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have dug up almost 12 hectares, about one third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall, once up to three meters high, were found.
Although little remains of the houses and workshops, archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, public buildings, the city-based dense building, the “business centre” and the residential suburbs.
The Yunacite Tel is often referred to as the Avian City, where dozens of earthen birds were found.
All the birds were at rest, so it was assumed that they were objects of local worship rather than ornamental objects.
The Avian City was destroyed about 4100 years before our Common Era, possibly by the Indo-European tribes that came from the north-east.
Nomads had no cities, but horses and weapons.
The three-metre security walls didn't stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a brutal massacre: remains of the elderly, women and children with marks of wounds sustained by combat axes were found inside the houses.
New findings and new facts emerge every year, changing the habits of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly speaking, not of certain cultures, but of the “lost” first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive to seek this civilization was the "golden Varna" found relatively recently in 1972.
Logically, Varna's gold luxury had to be preceded by something -- something like a tiny gold bush created in The Daily U.S.
The 911 Targa model was artificially aged in Porsche
It has been officially stated that 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is provided by manual experts from the unit working with serial machines.
"Retro-Luc" is, for example, a special color of Etna Blue body, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, and even a logo of the model is drawn in this color.
In addition, the targa obtained a fixed white chart along the sides and a special 20-inch wheel drive RS Speeder, as well as some details on the design of the body in the “white-gold metal”.
There is a marked decrease in retro-drive interior: it differs, in large numbers, from the gray and blue gamma-forming, from the new seats with extended power bands and separate black anodized steel to the thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, each buyer will be given a car chalole gift and a richly divided album containing photographs of the production process.
The power installation of Porsche Exclusive does not touch steel: the retro-targ is very similar to the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbo inflated volume of 3.0 litres, which develops 420 ls and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued with limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the cost of each particular sport may be reported.
Facebook and ad blockers launched an arms race
The recent introduction of Facebook technology to prevent advertising from hiding on social media has led decision makers to block the response notices.
AdBlock Plus released "annoyance", but Facebook plans to make it useless too soon.
So AdBlock Plus announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
The social media noted that in an effort to deceive the new technology of unblocked advertising, the AdBlock Plus decision, together with commercial ads, block many regular posts from friends or pages.
Facebook regretted this AdBlock Plus policy and promised to resolve the problem soon.
According to the source of the TechCrunch social media, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook descriptor site will be available within the next hour.
Thus, socialists and blockers have unleashed a kind of “arms race”, trying to play each other, and users who have missed interesting recordings from friends or who have seen advertising where they are not accustomed to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of the blockage of advertising have recently been hotly debated.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought to justice by the Murmansk Evening Court.
His case has already been completed in the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Murman Region.
The alleged charge against a 54-year-old man is very serious: the commission of sexual violence.
The investigation found that, at the end of November 2015, the accused in the Paula Street area in Murmansk had committed sexual assaults against a 20-year-old girl. The criminal case against the confirmed indictment was sent for examination on the merits.
This article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring cross-swan Fengguang 370 to Russia and Rich New - website at www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of China's growing motor vehicle class that combines minivan and crossover dignity.
Another declared Russian prime minister is Rich New.
Many of Moscow's western firms this year have decided to ignore the international car, so the empty Crocos Expo exhibition rooms will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation will be a powerful front, with large species on the Russian market and its intention to offer a number of interesting innovations to our car lovers in the near future.
One of these will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370, sold in China this spring at a price of 55,900 Yuan (almost less than 550,000 roubles at current rates).
Such a pricer is hardly bright to the Russian people, and the issue of transfers to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to reach the 11th place on the list of the most sold minivans, although due to the great roadlight (175 mm) and the protective plastic covering on the lower perimeter of the body, it could well be counted as crossovers.
Crosswan is built on a front-hand platform of the younger Fengguang model 360, with a similar wheel base of 2,725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4,565 mm vs. 4,510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The Salon is decorated with wooden bars, but the large vertical sensory screen shown on the photo "as in the Tesla" on the central console was only on early crossover exhibitions, and cars with "music" were sold more easily.
Five of the seven landing places are easily formed, forming a level loading area of 1,650 mm long and a maximum trunk capacity of 1,500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine is only one - 1.5 litre petrol "atmosphere" with a power of 115 ls. connected to a 5-step mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the machine, but promises the obsessive budget of the owner an appetite of 6.7 l/100 km.
Picap Rich New is a well-known Russian-known NP300 Navara generation, but with a slightly chilled Chinese designist.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model still has a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unwelcome “working horse”.
At a similar price, Rich New will probably be interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines of choice: petrol 2.4 l (137 L) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 L).
The gearbox is only a mechanics, the drive is to the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a rigidly connected "front".
It will be on the Dongfeng stand and the new flag sedan A9 and its Russian Prime Mission, the Chinese firm, will have an annotated as early as June.
Minvano-like cross-crossers in the Chinese market are increasing, one of the latest new ones is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Russian ruler Dongfeng is composed of two models: sedana S30 and Hetchbek H30 Cross.
During the seven months of this year, the dealers of a Chinese firm carried out 696 vehicles in our country.
Transport tax notices will no longer be sent by mail - Web site at www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the way in which property tax notices are sent.
All Russian car owners have become accustomed to a year-old pattern: in summer and autumn, they receive receipts by mail for the previous year's transportation tax.
This year, however, many of them will not be able to wait.
The matter is that the tax inspectorate has changed the way citizens are notified without undue noise.
Those who are registered with the taxpayer's Personal Office on the official website of the agency nag.ru will receive the notice electronically.
In the inspection, the Russians were automatically identified as online users and deleted from a standard, “paper” distribution.
New developments affect all owners of vehicles and real estates.
All others will continue to receive regular letters.
However, it is also possible to get back to the old scheme for account holders on the website.
This will require them to visit the tax office during the month of August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after writing, while the letter will take a few days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of Internet tax inspection users has surpassed over 18 million, allowing the agency to save considerably on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly insufficient to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some may have registered in the “personal office” to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten it.
They will not wait for a message to be sent by mail, nor will they be able to come into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the “Investigator's Personal Cabinet” is made in three ways: via the register of the gosuslugi.ru portal, by means of an electronic signature or input, and the password specified in the registration card.
The latter may be obtained in person at any tax inspection office (independent of location).
We recall that this year the transport tax has to be paid before 1 December.
The notification began in July.
Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-grade, which seeks to achieve a very high impact, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the G-oopers who started to modify Mercedes-AMG G 63.
The G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human is foreign to its masters.
Really, why not improve G 63 - 571-strong flying caudal with tank aeronautics up to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
By scooping up a crazy gelique, the master took advantage of the benefits of a 5.5-litre eight-year-old inflator.
Now, the trend of the race to 100 has improved by 0.1 seconds, and now the flying "crypic" is capable of cutting at 5.3 seconds.
On the other hand, the acceleration from medium speeds is definitely better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if standard G 63 is not travelling faster than 210 km/h, a tunnel all-way with a deactivated electronic collar can pull 250 km/h.
The vehicle outside is practically indistinguishable from its factory source, except for other wheel discs, the 23-inch Hurricane RR is 305/35 ZR 23.
The Lux Unit Mercedes-Maybach annotated an amazing conceptual pile of 6 metres long, which will be presented at the Pelble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz will compete with the Green Subbrand BMW i and will advance its electrical models under a separate trademark.
A minimum of four environmental innovations are expected in the coming years.
