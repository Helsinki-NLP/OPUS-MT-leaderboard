Parliament does not support an amendment that gives freedom to Timoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in the course of its amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to repeal the article condemning opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko.
An amendment that would have led to the release of the former Prime Minister in prison was rejected at the time of the second reading of the bill on the mitigation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unprofitable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider Timoshenko's appeal in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process is also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes.
Libya’s Victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert and the war is over without him.
It's time to identify the winners.
Islamists generally prevail in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself to be a follower of the customary law of Shariat, which we have already heard of.
Libya would become a crime-free country, since the penalty for theft was the cutting of hands.
Women may forget emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a rival clan society will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that is unlikely to wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind nor the best and most likely not be suitable, for example, for the people of Libya.
In fact, it is amazing that Islamic militants have accepted help from unbelievers.
Their only excuse was that they believed that NATO was led by God, not by an American general, but by a God whose greatness they glorified after each blow.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political allies, without any guarantees of benefit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, need not be concerned about the expulsion of the Krestoners.
Although without occupation, would oil companies receive Libyan black gold for almost valueless purposes?
Most likely they won't, and the West will finally be able to leap for the selfless protection of civil rights.
Unless Shariat's followers put an end to it.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are now at the heart of investors.
A statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries have reported GDP data in three quarters.
In comparison with the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stagnation, and Germany and France were growing.
Yet, the debt market is breaking record today.
Investors are not only looking towards Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
German GDP increased by expected 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, where Germany had better cases than expected (a 0.3 per cent increase instead of the original 0.1 per cent), France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (original information meant stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, as compared to the previous quarter, GDP was stagnant, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts had predicted.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary increase of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
On the basis of preliminary and seasonal data, Germany ' s economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
Between July and September, both the Eurozone and the European Union economies showed a 0.2 per cent growth over the previous quarter, which coincided with the forecasts of analysts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary drop of 5.2 per cent.
Its 10-year bond has a return of 28.45 per cent.
The income of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching the critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the deteriorating situation in the region, the return of Czech 1-year-old bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is said to be the last creditor to save the situation.
The collection Czechia was selected in EURO.
They won at 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team successfully completed the most challenging task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and the beautiful goal of Peter Jirakek, they won at 1:0.
In the second half of the Czech team, it was a privilege to maintain a significant advantage after a home-based response match, and she will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing significant in the first half of time and a lot of luck in the second.
Czech national team, partly due to the end of the team; the great Czech; and the heroic Yiraček; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Cup.
The superior defense of the Czech team allowed the Montenegro team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damyanovich and Vučić became the most unsuccessful match after losing two great opportunities.
The great Peter Chech is one of the reasons why the Czech national team won't miss the European Championship next year, and Czech football will make about 200 million Czech kroner.
Since the first few minutes, the game has been very tense.
The two teams had difficulty combining; the game was spent most of the time in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure on the first-time master team, and the long-term attacks on the defence line were carefully intercepted by the Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country ' s nuclear programme.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students have created a live shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
In doing so, they wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, the students ’ prayers were followed by a plea for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a human shield around the Isfahan uranium Enrichment Plant.
In this way, they have demonstrated their willingness to defend their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its last report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that it was clear that Iran had not abandoned its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons.
The potential attack on nuclear facilities in Iran has been discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, both the U.S. and Israel were supplicated for their prayers before entering the Isfahan uranium Enrichment Plant.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysing of the Iranian nuclear programme, the objectives will be, according to the Israeli press, the installation of both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Nutrition of obese children: No breakfast or sausage for dinner
More than one third of the children between the ages of 9 and 13 were overweight; while 9 per cent of the children were overweight, 5 per cent were obese.
According to a recent study, obesity-prone children usually come from unhealthy families.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and patterns of human behavior to his or her healthy development.
For example, a sausage shows up on the tables of obese children almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of obese children ate fries for dinner on the eve of an educational event called Obesity is no accident.
Moreover, the families of obese children do not engage in sports, but most of the families of modern school children - only 15 per cent of the children said that their parents found time to engage in sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last school year, with nearly 900 primary school students throughout Bohemia participating.
Obesity was not an accident for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company VšeoCenná zdravotní pojiáovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils from 4 to 8 grades have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient exercise are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either overweight or obesity.
"For example, only half of those interviewed said they were eating five meals a day, according to breakfast, lunch, dinner, which is a prerequisite for proper nutrition," says one of the conclusions of the study.
No lunch and no sausage at night
Experts warn that even relative details such as regular family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of school children's families have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
The worst discovery is that in every tenth family, people don't have breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis for a proper daily diet.
The study found that roasted food is more common in families with obese children.
Almost every one, regardless of his weight, drinks sweet, cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure falls more than half, to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to develop their own menu based on the proposed products and based on their own tastes and preferences.
“Food preferences for Czech children aged 12-15 years are far from ideal for healthy nutrition.”
Their favorite food includes large amounts of flour, meat, and sweet food.
"A particular concern is the high popularity of sweet cool drinks," says the final part of the study.
A small overhanged bird was defeated by pasta as the main dish of food.
However, children showed little interest in legumes, fish and vegetables.
Desire for a Healthy Life - Style
The study also showed that children are prepared to change their eating habits, provided that they are provided with relevant information.
“Many of the members of the monitoring group have shown a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they filled out the questionnaire after the lecture was completed - this is not an accident,” says the outcome of the project.
This was particularly evident, for example, in the case of sweet, cool drinks, with more children choosing just water.
In addition, children were more likely to observe poultry and fish as the main food, limiting the number of sweets and pastries.
The Stilist must also be a good psychologist, professionally.
In the first article on style training, I visited the volume of information at the induction sessions.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in this field; dress advice for non-standard figures; and seminar on how it works in real life.
It's more than that.
The closer we get to the final examination, the more information and practical assignments are expected.
Training goes through every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time with Alenka, director, (no man at all) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
In one short neck, in another boy’s body without proper shape, another weighs more than normal.
The columnist should know how to visually reduce the broad shoulders, extend the neck, or add missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to highlight the figure of women such as Jennifer López, i.e., women with more luxuriant breasts and thighs and narrow waists, without wearing them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in the number of waists and thighs is so large that you cannot pick a skirt or a pair of trousers, you might want to have at least one item on order.
You will certainly not regret the investment, since perfectly seated clothing is invaluable.
You're going to feel much better in your custom jacket than someone who's always moving, rolling, nakeding, etc.
On the other hand, the owners of the male figures may wear clothing with rushs, applications, stitches or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I'm glad I've got a week to realize this.
Still, I'm afraid it's too much given the homework we got.
Each participant in the course had to come up with two costumes for a celebrity, one for a day and one for a night.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothing and the type of figure.
I've got to wear Miranda Kerr, who you may know from Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself because it's much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who recently recovered to a ton (please mean I'm exaggerating), or a very young Selena Gómez.
We have to cut our clothes out of magazines or find them online, print and process them with graphic programs.
Mudboard -- what it's called the work result -- then reflects our own style and attitude towards the drawing.
It is important to keep in mind the graphical form of the style.
Not only does he wear real people but he creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the fashionist and designer Mario Kamennik told us about.
But it was only Sunday.
A Stylist Needs Common Knowledge
The Saturday lecture, full of information about the types of figures, was revived by three visitors, specialists in the field.
Stilist, Honza Poconni; fashion designer, Jakoub Polanca; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminds us that fashion is an illusion and styler must use this fact.
A good styler can use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a coat-night can be worn in a common way, on top of jeans and T-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on a bare body, without a pinnacle, like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll a sleeve or lift a collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he said.
Anyway, I appreciated the following advice: "For your work, you need to know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them," Jakub told us.
Here I finally realized why we were bisoning all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, whereas in fashion magazines we often see something very different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I've learned that the stanist must have more versions of the clothing available than the number of photographs he needs to take.
So for a fashionable 10-page view (equivalent to ten) I should be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, clothing often looks and works in conjunction with others, not at all as it is in reality.
We need to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Poconna confirmed that image and style are often half success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing eye, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of the Stilists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even well-known people often find it unnecessary (and believe it's enough to be expert in something, and what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to give us a size different (less) than they do.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids were writing anything about some famous fatted/damaged thing, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario stressed the need for a fashionist to be able to pick up a dress.
Our work is mainly to communicate with the people we wear; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to condone them, and to hold to one’s own opinion.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"You can find at least a few things you can commend and suggest you can wear with them," said Mario.
He also showed us that the handbag should be placed specifically.
It's a bag that you put around the waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious items such as scissors, sticky video clips or English pins, it should contain nylon thread (stylists use it when filming certain items, such as bags or hats), special clips to tie the cloth on their back if the clothing is too large (beaks and similar items are prohibited because they spoil clothing) or a sewing kit.
To distract ourselves from the lectures and to gain some practical experience, we learned how to put shoes on the soles of our shoes.
Even in studios where floors are smooth, soles can be damaged -- let alone street surveys.
So we got into a sticker.
You don't have to touch the shoes with scissors, so you don't spoil them.
It requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario commended my work.
The skills I mentioned didn't really love me.
That's just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend.
I'm beginning to realize that being a professional styler isn't as easy as talking.
V Need for Speed: Running is happening in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a carefree trip turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of totally inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambitions were somewhat satisfied, but that was not important, as no one clearly wanted to do more work.
Before the new version was released under the subheading "Fleeing", there was great hope.
It was expected to move the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demonstration versions indicated that the game would take a decent place in a race jingle.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero comes out of the car and runs.
As often happens with NFS, there's a lot of difference in the end from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression is a few unnecessary mistakes that have been in this series for several years.
So it's not really a mistake, it's an unexplained laziness by the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You're part of a story that Jack, the main hero of the story, solves any personal problems by engaging in an illegal race across America.
You're getting into a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
It's a little bit of an interesting thing.
The route consists of 10 phases divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race passes along its own route, with separate phases taking place in a diverse and interesting environment.
Therefore, there is no sense that the game is always the same.
Despite the fact that the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series, it is a pleasure to look at some of the roads.
Still, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs, or high in the snowy mountains, it is a pleasure.
Furthermore, the race occasionally revives an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert, you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
On the other hand, you need to be careful not to get under the bench.
The separate races are quite well organized.
There's only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while, you're trying to outrun several rivals (in fact, a regular race); then you're trying to improve time; or you're competing with one opponent.
Among other things, you occasionally come across the police, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just interactive animation, where most of Jack's time is running away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
While it's surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for the game because it doesn't tire out; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more interesting.
The race model follows previous models.
That means it's no longer something special, but it's not a disadvantage.
If you're looking for a real life simulation, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.
Still, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic races, although better options can be found in the market.
So far, it's very good.
But after a while, problems start to happen.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model isn't that good.
You don't expect a lot of transformations and collisions from this game, but if you don't know what's going on in front of an object, what's going on in your car, something's wrong.
Usually when you run or drive past cars in a dense stream, you sometimes touch a different car slightly, but sometimes in a situation almost similar to that, your car starts to unroll itself.
Or it's broken.
It's not so important because of a restart system, but it's enough to ruin fun.
The restarts are arranged so that if you crash or leave the track far away, the game will take you back to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you're using them all, you're gonna have to start the race from the start.
It's useful if something doesn't work, but you can't fully rely on it.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to learn to run a separate section of the race.
An important lack of play is the fact that the same things often happen in the same place.
For example, some turns need to go in a certain way, or you just won't fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a certain place in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It's especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent easily passing between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you're in the opposite direction, the cars are already in such a position that you need to either move around or slow down.
It doesn't matter when you stand by them; it's all arranged that the situation always happens in front of your nose.
There are other advantages to rivals.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of the time, the same rival will beat you up in the same place.
It's especially obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your rival must stand before you no matter what.
The thing is, when he's driving in front of you, he's making you worse at seeing what's causing you one or more of these accidents on this site.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get a little bit hotter.
I'm sorry, because despite the simple driving model, the game is interesting and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's happening around you.
It doesn't matter what doesn't let you miss -- the concept of fifty unique paths, a sequence of races or something.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the gas stations along the way, because they can change your car, even though in most cases the one you already have is quite sufficient.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American machines are for direct highway cuts; and exotic superscotchs for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain tracks.
The main mode mode is closely related to the callenge mode; it is an individual site race that you will find out during the game.
Here you win for your personal business, both medals and glasses common to challenges and arty regimes.
Many opportunities are available for higher driving levels: from cars to profiles.
The profile is also linked to the Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your performance with that of other players and provides public relations.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; it's an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (let's say you do) where you run through the tracks in the dark (let's say you do).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 km to 200 km/h (let's assume it is) when you suddenly get hit by a subway train, turning your car into a scrap metal breast.
For a few days, our version has been discussing whether no one really thought at the time of the game's creation, or whether its creators really think of us as such fools.
The technical component game is nothing special; but the general impression of the video camera is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although it is regrettable that in some critical points the quality of the record is sometimes quite low, it is declining.
This is especially true of incidents involving a large number of participants, where a good recording would not have helped you much either.
The sound's fine; the sound is for a lover.
To please the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack's got different style compositions; but it's unlikely that many people will buy a game because of its music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: Running is pretty messy.
If the game were to avoid obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Running is the best part of NFS over the past few years.
In any case, the game leaves a sense of incompleteness.
Of course, this is good entertainment, but prepare yourself to be blinded as an airport searchlight.

Ambassador Vicenova to the EU:
Czechs have a reputation for not wanting and sceptics vis-à-vis the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has generated considerable differences among individual organizations.”
"I didn't expect such a brutal war."
“It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, calms down and all the players get used to their new roles”, EU Ambassador Milena Vicinov began his lecture hard at the Faculty of Law.
She has proven to be following her slogan “Employively and Openly About Europe” in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and their relations so simple and clear that many lecturers from the KU Faculty of Law would be jealous.
Moreover, Vicenova commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"At the beginning, critics were told he was a normal gray office mouse, which can't perform any role; I have to say, everybody was amazed at how well he managed his role."
“He is a person who can listen at the same time to the twenty-seven participating countries, is excellent in communicating with them and has a clear idea of which direction the EU needs to develop.”
She explained her new position as representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question: “Who is the European Union?
Nobody's gonna ban our cheeses.
Vicenova further focused on a programme that is key to the EU in the past, the present and the near future.
She described Czech presidency as a success over the past year.
The Czechs had been dealing with an imminent financial crisis; they had overcome the crisis and had organized an East Partnership summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at that time was a negative phenomenon that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czechs are currently very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador has said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing fermentation.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget must be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which countries will receive less; all these issues will be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels, “On Europe, I understand the language”.
"I really don't like cuts, foreign words and jargons, which nobody understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curls or round cucumbers or bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheeses.
It also intends to make more effective use of the EU environment and to attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered to be Euro-septics; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive aspects of things.
She wanted more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are at fault: the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
In addition to its successful presidency, the Czech Republic noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and we are joined by a Slovak, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what's the matter with the congregation again, the Visegrad Group?" And he's not happy with this."
In the future, the Vicinov Union is awaiting new strict rules mainly for the budgetary policies of the States parties.
In comparison with the new European Federation, it considers the idea to be two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside Eurozone. "
"We have the Shengen Zone, and we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that countries that wanted to join forces, whereas those who did not want to could stay away."
“The number of such institutions will increase; this will be a real two-speed Europe,” explains Vicinov.
In that regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in advancing the rule that all issues relating to the whole EU should be discussed by all member countries, not only those in the Eurozone.
The history of the brand:
IBM is entering the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one is likely to be "long-lived."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is regarded as very modern, although it was founded over a hundred years ago.
The company's longitude was built by her first boss, Thomas J. Watson's senior dreamer.
He believed that many of the world’s problems could be solved easily if people wanted to think.
His "Duma" slogan thus became the image around which the life of the future giant unfolded (and also the name of its internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson had carefully built.
"To us in IBM, long-term thinking means a steady movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because it remained faithful to its original values, although not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, this has enabled us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more," says Samuel J. Palmizano, current director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of the care of employees in the same way as Bata in the Czech Republic, the IMB staff were among the first American employees to have paid leave, insurance from the employer, elegant uniforms and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship of IBM with consumers is equally advanced.
It was one of the first world companies to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Concurs with the anti-discrimination strategy and current plan, according to which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked at IBM for 30 years; she is now a director of sales, marketing and development.
In the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, where many future innovations arise.
No wonder there's a lot of ideas - there's about half a million people working in the company.
An Organization with a good reputation
The firm ' s strong position in business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning, IBM was rather an organization rather than a technology company," said Harvard Business School Professor and author of the IBM book, Rosabet Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company; it's a company that helps solve business problems using technology," adds Joge Coloni from Forrester Research consulting company.
According to the company itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
Over a hundred years, IBM, or The Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It appears to be the most universal technology company that develops hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services, from servers to nanotech.
It owns the largest number of patents among all United States technology companies and has received the Nobel Prize for five of its employees.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode and a diskette.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization data, IBM this year became the second largest technology company in the world (the first place in Apple), covering Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look Forward
Not all of its products were tasted by buyers and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2, the Prodigy online service, and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is driven by the forward movement, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM is easy to build on several platforms -- if they don't work, it's going to give up on them.
It differs from, for example, its competitor, Microsoft, which is based and is experiencing a Windows crash, its operating system.
Forward-looking technology
The main revenue of IBM is derived from the services, about one fifth of which is derived in each case from computer software and hardware.
Whereas in 1990, it was twice as much capital, it was the strongest equipment company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth $15 billion, while at the same time investing 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis struck the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the Great Depression.
As yet, IBM does not seem to have damaged the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has increased by a record 120 per cent; the company ' s net earnings have increased steadily.
IBM corporate slogan to change everything except your own values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will handle the situation.
IBM history: from cheese knife to space flight.
IBM (International Business Science) was founded in New York a hundred years ago and its original title was "Collection of Calculations, Tabulations, Records" was quite complex.
It came to be known as IBM in 1924, and it was originally called the brand, which was used for the offices of the company in Canada and South America.
The basis for future IBM was a merger of four companies, the history of which began in the 1880s.
They owned technology, such as the legendary "table clocks", that is, the clocks that mark the time when employees come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlet Flint, who, until 1930, was also head of the board of trustees of the company.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the director of the competitor company, to help him manage the company.
The manager then turned the founder of IBM into a shadow - Watson's ideas remain the basis of an enduring corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from the name, started from the production and sale of various business equipment, ranging from crude knives and meat to cashiers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, the proceeds doubled to $9 million, and a large-scale expansion of the company to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that after almost 40 years his seat in the director's chair was occupied by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his guidance, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 man to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM line system/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, and at the same time bought a PricewaterhouseCoopers consultancy office, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high-value-added services.
In the last three years, IBM has made great progress with its concept of Smart Planet.
Its objective is to make reasonable use of technologies in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve road and urban management.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently presented the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire business cycle.
IBM's traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country at the same time in central and eastern Europe, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
Central and Eastern European headquarters is located in Prague, where there is also a world-level research group on speech recognition.
About his unfaithful husband:
Iveta, I don't need it anymore!
Darina Richtaryzov (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Josef Richtarge (53), became the bodyguard and lover of Ivetah Bartoshova (45), Darwin still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can go home, but not as my partner," explained Richtarzewov.
When Darina Richtarzova gave Bartoshova blood in her home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Ivet to leave Rjičan after 30 days, Pep did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up pretending she had accepted her husband's novel, and now she is finally forgiven him.
I don't care who his wife is sleeping with.
Even if Richtarz and Bartoshov were to break up one day, his wife wouldn't accept him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will throw him out."
"However, he'll end his days, not as my favorite, lost and found old fool, but as the man with whom I'm tied," said Richtarzewov, adding that she's already free of her husband and insists only on a double suit.
As long as Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yveta, I'm not gonna change it."
"My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect this decision."
"Our union continues to function; I am responsible for repairing, gardening, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly well, except we don't share a bed anymore," said Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtarzova finds new love, he will not interfere with her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she's with and whether she's got a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Ivet and I'm totally responsible," Joseph concluded.
The worst of women's habits: Do they touch you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad women's habits, they usually list them all right away.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines describing a number of women's habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Does your other half complain you're going shopping all the time?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping on big sales?
If so, your shopping may be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit they need to control their shopping passions.
And yet, who of you will refuse to walk around clothing stores looking for ideally seated clothing and exemplifying it?
Chopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it could be a hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside...
Everlasting Dissatisfaction
"I'm too fat?"
"I need to drop at least five kilograms-- maybe I should start doing gymnastics."
"You're still coming to me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you're part of a group of women who've got their looks mixed.
Not that you have to stop looking at yourself, but in a literal sense, many men have an allergy about persistent complaints by a partner to his or her appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more complaints are made, the more women get angry with them.
Orderliness and Cleanliness Is the Most Important
It's like an endless story.
Wet glass, vacuum cleaners, floor washing, antique dust, bathroom cleaning - at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for attacking a clean coffee in dirty shoes; children for mud in a clean sink and fingerprints on a window glass in a living room that was so hard to clean?
If you suffer from this rejection, try to realize that it is not good to fall into extremes; and that your family should not put order and cleanliness first.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship as well as your whole family.
Desire to Command
"Drive your clothes in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels for dishes shall not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood it, women wouldn't have to be in charge of them so often...
Cycling
Some women like to gossip, insult, and scheme against others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk about who, where, who, and why.
From time to time, maybe every one of us is spreading gossip.
We'll be frank, that's the obvious nature of all women.
In any event, there are more serious gossips, women who often gossip and despise others; they, especially in the women's work force, pose a great threat to their environment.
The successful transmissions of Jagr and Vorachek helped Philadelphia win
During the NKL game on Monday, two successful broadcasts of the hockey attacker Jaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the ice of Caroline, again becoming the most effective Czech match player in the game.
In both cases Claude Girú used the experience of a 30 - year - old star; he added another gear and was declared the best match player.
Two successful matches were also owned by the player on the same team with Yagro Jakubu Vorcek.
After Jagra's match, he told foreign journalists that he had predicted Gira a wonderful evening.
"I told him till the game he'd beat a hith-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometime you feel these things," Yagra explained, after Gir's actions, he hit a goal at the first opportunity Flakes had.
A little later on, the team's second goal also had a "Czech trace".
The locker Harrikins Vorkek took possession of the saub and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who hit between the circles.
One second before the first break, Patrick Duyer, the home player, reduced the divide with a lot of advantage, but at the beginning of the second time, Flyers was again led.
Especially Giru.
After Yagra's successful delivery, he scored a third goal; then he was turned into a fourth goal, Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean to say that he's the best league player, but he definitely goes into the three best," said Jagr, commending his center.
"I never thought I'd end my career playing with a hockey player like him."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to help me, and now it's my turn," Yagra added.
Caroline made the game more dramatic with Tumo Ruut and the Dower Toolbar, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reid, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger did great in our area."
"He hit the puck, I accelerated, and Reid crossed the far edge."
"I aim at him and I'm glad it worked," he described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to first place in the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the Montreal Chech team, Jaroslav Spacek, did not complete the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period because of the injury to the upper body.
Together with an experienced defender, Canadans lost their two-way advantage and lost 2:3 after the series.
Tomasz Plekanec was unable to kill in one of their attacks.
More than the lost glasses, the home coach was upset by the large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"No matter what, we can't do anything about it, we just have to accept it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement for replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck out of our area."
"What was our weak side," added counsel for P.K. Soubban
After 30 attacks, the Czech Hilkipper Onjee Paulec helped Winnipeg to defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Golls of Jets, who interrupted the five-part series, were killed by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five State tourism agencies were able to work in the former Czechoslovakia: Şedok, Sportist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, the tourist agencies of the time were mainly selling tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was between 1962 and 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, which placed considerable restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., and Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually to socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel by himself, for example to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation from that country was needed; another individual trip was not possible.
At that time, travel agencies were offering to travel to the West, but they had to either stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
The currency permit was necessary to travel to the West, and it was not given to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
Czechoslovakian currency was not freely convertible; without its authorization it was not possible to obtain money (west currency) for travel to the West.
The Czechs were most likely to spend their vacations at home, resulting in large numbers of cottages and summer homes, a habit that continues to this day.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus experienced a real revolution.
While pre-1989 leave in the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our journeys, last year Czechs held 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are no longer aware of is that until 1989, we were unable to visit freely the most popular Croatia today, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe was abolished, which led to a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovaks could not have been satisfied with their journeys to the West, and everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income was not enough at the time for a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring in its own food (conservation, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech kroner, and after decades our tourists can finally buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and average income have increased, leading to another important development around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled travel agencies to prepare regular flights by charter companies; compared to the past, flights have now become incredibly cheap owing to the ability to order wholesale discounts.
By the late 1990s, the Czechs didn't need a visa to visit almost all the developed world countries except the United States, which made our journeys even easier.
The following significant event in the history of travel since the revolution took place in 2000: a great demand led to a historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flights from the Czech Republic will be sent in twelve exotic directions.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important development of this period, which symbolizes our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. lifted the need for a visa for Czech tourists, and in this way, our country joined the most developed countries in the world forever.
For the first time in history, in 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during overseas leave, including their expenditure at their destination.
The general assembly has to choose the president. The threat of the Pat is coming back.
For about five months, Czech football had no president, and there was a risk that the successor Ivan Hashek, head of the Czech football association (FAHR), would not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement as to what electoral rules to follow.
Without this vote, no ballot for one of the three candidates will begin.
Jindrich Raichl, Miroslav Pelta, and Tomas Pazlik are eager to lead Czech football.
Gashek left his post in June, and when he left, he called on his colleagues to join together and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, the Hasheka era once again sank football between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This was quite apparent on 16 September, when it was necessary to elect a new president.
The delegates to the General Assembly had come to the National House in Prague, Smykhov because the negotiations had remained blocked, not only by the electoral process.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the general assembly - only legal representatives or officials granted powers.
This point has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of the State and the Rights that a mission based on the powers granted cannot be established.
The debate over the electoral rules, however, is continuing.
The Executive Board has also not been too helpful, although it is mainly concerned with this matter at its meetings, both ordinary and extraordinary.
Views on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: how do I go to the 3rd round and avoid sweating?
“The dispute is whether to follow the established standards or to find another model”, says one of the Vice-Presidents of FA ́R Doshan Liberty, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
On the basis of the model envisaged by the statute, the winner of the third round is the candidate who has received great support from the Chamber from which he is the candidate.
Moravia is said to agree on a compromise to be the winner of the election of the candidate with the highest number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side insists that, in the overall percentage, the winner must obtain at least two thirds of the votes.
“At least the two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; it would have totally rejected the concept of the two chambers”, Freedom agreed with Moravia's arguments, and he said that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with the existing rules.
A few surprises, Tomas Paclik concurs with his view, although the electoral rules defined by the statute have been assessed by Pelt as more than the other candidates.
"I'd like to see the elections run as fast as possible."
"I want to avoid all kinds of representational foolishness, as at the previous general meeting," says Victoria Plzen, the owner who is the first candidate; and in his remarks he mostly contradicted Pelte.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He trusted that the new President would be known in Nimburg; he also hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All emotional fermentation will be calmed after today's expected national arrival at the European Championship."
"Foutball will be back on a happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Applec, who has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rachel's more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"It's not between Bohemia and Moravia, but there's an attempt to adapt the rules deliberately."
"This could cause another breakdown of the general assembly."
"I hope common sense wins," said Rachel.
There was not much time left for the parties to reach agreement.
According to some reports, individual negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight to Podgorica, which was to be carried by Vice-Presidents Dalibir Kucher and Rachel, among others, did not leave Prague in the morning owing to a technical failure, and an alternative was sought to bring part of the executive committee to the place where the match was held.
After all, the ministerial meeting, which is expected on Wednesday, can become decisive.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sports, Joseph Dobes, would like the opposing parties to reach an agreement with the strongest sports association in the country.
Much was at stake: government subsidies; creditworthiness of football; and a planned general meeting of the "STV " , with a new directorate of Czech sport following Sazka ' s financial problems.
Pacili's entering the presidential struggle because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If, prior to the extraordinary general meeting, the head of the football team, Plzen Tomas Paclik, could see a strong candidate who would meet all of his requirements for the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA!R), he would not even have claimed a high post.
"If there were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight myself."
"But such a man has not yet been found," said Pazlik ŞTK.
Motivated Pazlik to fight against Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Raichl, to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged favour of the elections, from entering the administration of the FA-R.
Moreover, Paclik stresses that if won, he will not remain President until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be occupied by an experienced top manager not too connected with football life.
"I've talked to a few people I could have mentioned."
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that they don't even want to be involved in Czech football right now."
"I should like to change that opinion," said he.
At present, the main difference between Patzlik and Pelta relates to the latter ' s relationship with Roman Berbrom, president of the regional football association in Plzen, Berbre is a conflicting reputation known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist capable of affecting the voices of the delegates of the general assembly.
The Paclyk thus considers it unacceptable that Pelta should become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will not change, and football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berbre, a capable businessman, it would be even more detrimental to football," said Paclic.
He suggests that a few years ago the name Pelta was recorded while listening to telephones in an investigation into the corruption case; Pelté was able to avoid conviction.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring."
"And as we would have looked in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pazlik, "he doesn't mention his earlier statement that he "will sell the Plzen Club if Pelta becomes president."
If Paclic were to win on Thursday, he could have represented cooperation with Pelta in the future.
That view was shared by another candidate, Rachel, who was supported by Paclik before the general meeting in September, which ended in the fiasco.
"He would be the first person I would turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce him to the head of the team."
"But he can't run the association."
'I too can't stand what I don't understand,' said Pazlik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judicial brigade led by Manek Matsela, who was succeeded by Dogmar Damkov.
The patient claims he'll risk running an association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; he has been running the Plzen team since last summer, which, with his help, celebrated its first triumph in the League in May.
"I have the power to make the football environment change, to support its changes for the better."
“Restricting the influence of certain groups of persons who are inclined to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, which leads to heinous situations”, said Paclyk, who does not hide his antipathy, such as the Director of Sparta, Daniel Krzetinski.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAA Fund and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help it will lobby at the highest political level for more money for lottery sports.
"This is one of the key points that the new president has to deal with."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must make clear where the money goes," he said.
Pazlik does not consider his association with the Plzen Club to be a burden, although he claims that President FA-R should be independent.
Pelta's connected to the Apple, and Rachel's connected to the Prague Duclay.
"This isn't the perfect."
"And yet I see no sense in the hypocritical transmission of my shares of the Plzeng club to someone else, since I'm going to go back there in six months," said Pazlik.
The Pelta promised new FA'R rules that would prevent the Elect Pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for the new FA ́R rules to avoid future disputes over the rules of election.
Prior to the negotiations on Thursday in Nimbunk, the Applenitz function is optimistic and believes that attention to the pre-election struggle will significantly distract today's expected success of our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general meeting. The two-month delay could thus be useful to him to defend his ideas on football in the broader context.
"People at all levels have been on football for a long time, and they expect the President to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that now is the time for someone to lead the association," claims a man who is mainly associated with the Jablonec Club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
This gives him reason to assume that he's experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the present problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during Ivan Gaske’s reign.
"Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted by the general meeting in June."
"Had it not been for the different ways of representation, we would have had a president since September," said Pelta.
He referred to the copying of the key document of the civil association as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become president, I'm going to consider it my own personal task, and I'm going to take personal responsibility if this attempt fails."
"This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist," states Pelta.
Besides, he says he's not trying to identify himself against rivals.
In the past, he had stated that he could represent his cooperation with Jindrich Raichl, whom he appreciated for his legal education; he was fully aware that his rival candidate should become his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Pazlik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been on football for over a year, and he's been successful."
"No matter what, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people were surprised by the methods of his campaign campaign."
“And so some of them now question his true identity,” said Pelta, about his rival.
He considers his main weapon the knowledge of football, from the lowest level to the national assembly.
The national team should represent all football.
"I would also try to put an end to all incidents, starting with the case of the Bohumians or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would focus immediately on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee sufficient money for all football," the 40-year-old candidate said two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football head would not result in staff dismissals.
"I will need to know the official instructions of the individual staff," which was his message to Fear, where a prolonged period of inter-authority is causing a clear nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believed that delegates would not arrive in Nimburg on Thursday.
"If the only issue is how to hold elections in the third round, we can handle it."
"Foutball needs the trust he can gain by finally choosing his leader," says Pelta, who, two days before the key day of his career, remains optimistic.
Rachel promises that his leadership, the FA-R, will be active.
If, at the meeting on Thursday, Jinjich Raichl, the current Vice-President, becomes president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association are said to be upset.
Rachel promises that if he is chosen, there will be a time of hard work.
He wanted to introduce changes in the system and make members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the Goddesses; improve relations with both UEFA and FFA; attract more money into football; and continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Hasheka.
"As President, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national gathering, professional football and football events for young people”.
"I don't mean to say I'll do it myself," said Rachel in his interview for the "TK."
"I'm a command player, and I want to allocate powers to the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area."
"I'm doing my best to set out the challenges so that in each of these segments of football, I can take a big step forward."
"That would probably not be enjoyed by many people because it would mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The climate of criticism in the football movement allegedly caused him to doubt his identity.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there's any point in it; and that I won't be surrounded by people who put sticks in my wheels and question my every move," he explained.
"At the same time, many people told me I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
"It's a trust I can't throw away," he said.
Moreover, he said that his motivation was to continue the work he had begun with Gashek.
"A great deal of work has been done over those two years, and I don't want to cancel it."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the Association might return to the one before Hashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something that I don't think competent Mirek Pelta."
"He's surrounded by people who would do football in such a way that it's available only to the elected people."
"I can be accused of a lot of things, but certainly not of being subjective."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone because then everyone will have a good time, not just an elected minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he refutes the charges that he will be the only president of the Czech Republic.
"While a lot of people are trying to argue otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"It is time, for example, to think about the division of the second league into the Czech and maritime parts, whose winners would continue the fight in the first league."
"It will prevent the current situation where there are only three marine teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Rachel.
While the leader of the Plzen Tomas Paclic club entered the presidential struggle, Rachel did not dare to assess his chances of winning.
“At the same time, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me its Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success”, said Rachel.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Affirming that Pelta was “excluded from returning creditworthiness to Czech football”, he considers another rival, Paclica, to be a strong candidate who has what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzen this year."
"If he is chosen, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started, without significant staffing changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his own good," said Rachel about his rival.
Europe’s Beautifulst Basins
Sneaking Into the Water
Julia Stanek
Child swimming pools with universal fibre optics and status basins in Budapest, travelers can test Europe's incredible water, and relax their tired body in the jakuzzie after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder was unable to do during his research tours for the last year and a half: without his bath suit.
She was lying on her back in the water, looking up at the taste of the shaped dome, swimming for the marble cherubs waiting outside the pool, and loving the carefully restored swimming pools in the Arnuvo style.
She was in a hurry to add every attractive pool to her notebook, with important details about the construction and history of the building.
The historian of the architecture of Meder examined more than 200 swimming pools - and now gathered impressions in his recently published book Badefreuden, where everything went from the public basins in Munich to the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest and the “functional concrete buildings” in Townus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited the baths in Italy, Croatia, the Czech Republic, France, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Serbia.
The 46-year-old author is a real shoplifter.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but it's different in the water.
The only drawback is that the swimrs must tolerate blue Capel tiles and the scent of chlorine, while the runners can breathe the lush smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyful chirp of birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible," says Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The splashing in the pool and the oils in the sauna are the health factor in the baths, because according to Meder, all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure to your eyes if the builders take on this kind of work. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tile, and springstones.
The 190-page illustrated edition of "Divorce of the Bath" provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of health oasis, and makes you want to jump into the water.
Meder found several outstanding copies during his study in Hungary.
She found nitrate-rich water in a carpentry cave (Mashcholc-Tapolce Dame) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termälfürdö in Yasberen), as well as excellent therapeutic baths, such as the 100-year-old baths of the Secheni in Budapest.
Many of the heated open basins in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, have an amazing view, and you can see all of Zurich from the dome on the roof, or you can see the snowy Arlberg from the open basin in St. Antonio, and there's a window in the steamboat that allows you to see what's happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design is waiting for bathers in Langenfeld, and the Aqua Cathedral in Etztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In winter, steam from three open sinks rises, which appears to be very small in the background of the Etztal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Meder’s swimming pools did not smell chlorine in every pool.
A lot of thermal baths smell like sulphur, Arpad's baths in Bekeshhab smell so much oil that it might be hard for you to believe that you're in a healthy source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in alkali water, and the water is almost black from the ilah, which is attached to the skin as soon as you sink into the pool, a certain type of health experience.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at some point in her search for beautiful baths, and when she tried to visit the open pool of the Czech baths in Lugachovics, she found that the area had been sealed.
The baths, designed by architect Doshan Jurković in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked into the red- and-white-yellow-styled windows of ar-nuvo, she saw weeds growing between the Capel tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks is the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, the Water Palace in Bad Wildbad.
The basses have already passed through three stages of construction, and you will discover not only the neo-Roman elements since the construction in 1844, but also the Mauritanian Alhambra Hall, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Terminal Palace, the beloved swimming pool of Iris Meder basins, was not just because it was from Schwarzwald.
"This is a real achievement -- so masterful to combine these different architectural styles," said Meder.
Getting into a thermal pool in such a palace is obviously a secondary occupation.
Stimulating agricultural products
Deutche Bank investigates agricultural trade.
Christian Tivs
Would Deutsche stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann gave the working group the task of investigating the effects of speculation on the world's poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans considered it unacceptable that banks were profiting from agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demanded that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world's poorest people.
The findings were drawn from a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of Foodwatch Consumers.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harold Shuman, shows that the world’s commodity exchange stakes raise prices — and banks are thus involved in the world’s hunger.
Consumers' campaign is directed directly against the Head of the Deutsche Bank, Josef Akkermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sacks and Morgan Stanley are trading in the same way.
Originally, the rates for goods were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that the players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism and promised to investigate the charges and stated that “no trade is worth putting at risk the good reputation of Deutsche Bank”.
In accordance with SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation is due to be completed by the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Governors of the Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods can decline or cease altogether.
Ackermann's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. “The rise in food prices is a blatant example of how banks now act thoughtlessly against common interests”.
As a bank lobbyer, Akkermann has a certain obligation, in Bode's view.
“The bank should remove from the portfolio all investments that make monetary rates on food prices,” said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if they're hungry people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Akkermann’s quick reaction is first surprising, but the director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before the end of his office.
The Bank announced on Monday that the President would not move to the monitoring board as planned.
The elimination of controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
Nor did he have to take care of expenses - his successor would have to deal with the consequences.
One in two would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bodé published the study on Tuesday: A study was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 persons participated.
No more than 11 per cent believed that investments that paid the price of food were acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such trade, according to a study, each other would withdraw deposits that would eventually lead to speculation of goods.
43 per cent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 per cent said that they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
The 21st Century House in Vienna
The Pavilion — A New Place
Ingeborg Winsowski
Archaeological history of take-off, fall-down and happy end: For the 1958 World Exhibition, Austria won prizes in Brussels, became a museum in Vienna, empty and abandoned.
Now it's being re-opened as an exhibition center.
Austria ' s pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a famous example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass lobbys, bold in expressing faith in technological progress.
Pavilion Schwanzer won Grand Pri in 1958 for his light, steaming steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
Eventually, he became known throughout the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and her sister, a bowl-shaped building.
Pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss Garden near the South Station of Vienna, was transformed and opened as the 20th Century Museum in 1962, and is often referred to as “The House of the 20th Century” for that reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons; there were no walls on which to hang works of art and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until the modern art of Vienna received a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition has deteriorated.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has so far restored the pavilion, which has been called “The House of the 21st Century” and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is a branch of the Belveder Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening, in every sense, a joyful event.
Agnes Husslein-Arko, who became the new director of the Belveder Gallery in Austria in 2007, contributed to the new endeavour.
Husslain Arco, a graduate of the Arts History Department with a brilliant career as a young figure, who worked at Sotheby's, the Huggenheim Museum, and eventually became founder and director of the Modern Museum in Strasbourg, convinced politicians and custodians to continue their reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and decided on how the building would be used.
The new museum was supposed to contain a permanent exhibition of Fritz Votruba Foundation, a cafe and a bookshop along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict & limited budget control
Krishanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Cession Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was for him a "very important place" where he attended "almost every week".
He knew the original design and the tasks that stood before the building, which had already lost part of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and converted.
The problems of the last restructuring were much more serious, and the building was a "energy absorber," says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, the glass glass glass was reinforced with a secure glass glass, and the glass roof was replaced with a high-end safety glass.
Steel translations of the thermal bridge were strengthened or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created a space for the re-use of the building, and the falling light well between the building and the street provides lighting - an almost new building, but still a beautiful Pavilion of Schwanzer.
The original outer doors were preserved and the building was painted in an old red- and brown-colored protection against corrosion.
Hall of the cinema is the same as it was before.
All of this is strictly controlled by the museum office and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and would have been approved by the museum office," says Krishanitz, pointing to the unequal floor in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light despite restrictions, problems and transformations.
Kryshanitz noticed recently that the Brussels pavilion was a rough, typical story of "the caps in the city."
Such an architecture is “always out of place” and yet wants to “incentive real awareness”.
The house of the 21st century is in a very good place, because there's an unexpected luck in the planning of the city, and the fully remodeled "Qartar of the main station" with offices and real estate is growing around the Swiss garden.
The second happy event, the 21st century, can be complemented by the second Krishanitz building, the collector Francesca von Gabsburg has purchased the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city about its location next door in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multimillion-million-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn published an anti-crisis plan to avoid canceling trains in the winter.
The number of staff should double.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid wintering and late trains.
Referring to the internal crisis plan of Deutsche Bahn, the newspaper Bild reports that by 2015, investments totalling about Euro300 million were planned.
Investments are designed to improve locomotives and railway networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of in-house and engaged staff involved in cleaning snow from roads and platforms will double to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before starting operations and 90 per cent of the required arrows within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned that trains could be cancelled and delayed in the winter at a meeting with government and industrial leaders two months ago.
The past winter of Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport because it lacked reserves at the time of the deterioration of weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been awaiting approval by the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also had to check ICE trains much more frequently for many years since one of the ICE trains broke down the axle at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay many millions of pounds of fines in the United States
New troubles followed the unrest around Josef Akkermann, director general of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is facing a fine in the United States for many millions of pounds.
Like Deutche, the Bank had few problems in its home country, and the past industrial giant in the United States had now driven it, and the Deutsche Bank, with its headquarters in Frankfurt, would pay $145 million (106 million euros) to settle disputes arising from the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accused a number of the largest banks of using false promises to deceive credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged credit unions down.
“We are glad to have solved this problem without the parties turning to the courts”, said the representative of Deutce Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not confess guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President Debbi Matz welcomed the prompt response of both banks.
The National Credit Unions Authority (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is fighting to compensate for the loss resulting from billions of dollars.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and in the summer he initiated proceedings against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Unsavory mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a mortgage pool.
They are supported by domestic loans.
This was decided by the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble appeared on the US real estate market in 2007.
The U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 to live on the precipitous financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still struggling with the storm.
Investors and regulators have made a large number of claims seeking compensation or punishment for fraud.
Behind the largest wave of claims is the Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA).
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of having purchased bonds of approximately $200 billion from the American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche also faces the threat of FHFA prosecution for numerous agreements worth $14.2 billion concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that the bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, assume responsibility for “substantial losses” but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
The Bank dismissed the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests 10 billion in IBM
Buffett's financial guru is actively investing in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
To date, the largest United States investor, Warren Buffett, has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed his view on investment in this industry.
According to Buffet, he had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and buying computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investment was regarded as a knight act.
IBM, an IT industry veteran, is now named "the IBM sir".
In an interview with the United States Business Channel CNBC Buffet, he reported that since March he had purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding of Burkshire Hathaway was one of the largest shareholders of IBM shares with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM until recently knew nothing about his involvement.
He commended the management that had been able to make gains even during the financial crisis.
"They did a lot of work," said Buffett, referring to the management strategy.
IBM has long focused on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, now over the age of 100, also offers software and advisory services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He claimed to invest only in companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, the production of lubricants and machinery.
His holding of Burkshire Hathaway owns a long list of the largest companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with some 80 of his own subsidiary companies.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built one of the world ' s most expensive companies on it.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
Making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct in making money brought him the nickname "Ocawula of Omaha."
The price of IBM shares increased by one per cent before the opening of the markets after the Buffett investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is called, stands on a stock exchange of over $220 billion, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
Inevitable danger
After the identification of the Tswickau “cells”, the Turkish media began to question the power of the law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of a blood ideology that is now rising again to the surface.
The killing of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of a right extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been a reaction to this communication in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has given rise to long-soled fears, such as the right-wing extremist attacks against the Turks since the burning of Mellin in November 1992 and Zolingen in May 1993.
There was never any doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has now been discovered is of a scale that is not fully understood.
"The Resurgence of Blood Ideology?" was the title of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret informant of secret services and expresses concern that the German authorities may be drawn into the right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded calmly by changing victims of racial hatred to a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Berlin Turkish Community celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on the recruitment of labour at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was like a stroke. "The gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X" commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriet also did not miss this parallel.
"It smells bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Külahji.
He noted that people who had paid taxes and had contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany had been killed.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent success of the raid were strongly criticized at German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not previously thought of monitoring suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have reached a rather sharp rhetoric. “If they continue to act in a similar manner, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves.”
"This will be the best self-defence."
"Peace in Germany depends very much on how the entire network is discovered and on the lawfulness of punishment," writes Selen.
The crimes in Mellin and Zolingen during the 1990s were an example of the world in Germany under threat.
The photograph of the burnt ruins in Zolingen was deeply impressed by the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown to the Turkish so clearly living here that they are in danger and to the Germans that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of Turkish unity.
Do not repeat past errors
At the time, the Turkish press had largely condemned the failures of the German police following the attacks, and Helmut Kol had refused to visit the survivors in Mellin.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the burning of Zolingen, but his Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel, took part in a memorial ceremony in Cologne in his speech, calculating the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It was as if he had determined the value of a man by the taxes he paid.
The current coverage by the Turkish media has again revealed the growing lack of confidence by many German Turks in the present German State since.
Clearly, efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany now need to be made.
Bank scandal on Lake Zurich
Most of the major risky policies of European banks are not in France or Italy but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly failed during the financial crisis and has been struggling with one or the other since.
Now the German has to get him back to the right course.
Alex Weber probably didn't know he was gonna have that part.
In July, after his effective resignation from the Head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013, he would begin to serve in an equally effective position — the chairman of the board of directors of the largest Swiss bank, UBS; an unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was obviously delighted, commended Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its renewed strength and made a few friendly comments to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Phillip and Oswald Grewbel."
But it was clear in September that things were going to be different.
The UBS trader in London has bypassed the bank's security systems and lost around Euro1.7 billion.
The Executive Director of UBS, Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS board has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Webber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank stated on Tuesday, he will be chairing the board in May rather than 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Weber.
He's a professor of economics and an expert in the Central Banking, not a traditional banker, and he's definitely gonna need time to adapt.
He suddenly became responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved once again that he had long earned the title of “the largest banking scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently - it has managed the largest assets in the world - and on the other, it has not come out of scandals for years.
It seems that a proud Swiss bank spares nothing.
It started at the time of the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The Bank combined the image of the hidden and sustainable but also the catchy asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the biggest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, it entered the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and bank professor who has long taught at the University of Zurich Banking Institute, explains: "I have always cited UBS as a good bank model to my students."
"Knowing what we know now, you might ask me how I could have been so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was going wrong in UBS.
In mid-year, the executive director Peter Wuffley, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker, suddenly resigned.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment unit of the bank attempted to play substandard securities and had to write down billions.
Believe it or not, UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs in capital to counter the crisis.
Indeed, the Bank was able to find investors -- but investors whose services many bankers would have been politely refused recently -- one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, hidden in such a way that even its name had not been disclosed.
It was only the first shot.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses and the chairman of the Board of Directors, Marcel Osper, the second-ever director of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, a disaster struck, and due to the lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS faced the threat of collapse, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank bought toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for an convertible bond with mandatory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
Switzerland was shocked to see the dramatic impact of huge banks in the small country.
After all, the overall balance of UBS in 2007 was five times higher than the total production of Switzerland (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster came shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in a tax dispute with the U.S. and stated that it was ready to transfer data from wealthy clients who might have been tax-free with the help of a bank.
UBS has also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of the recovery of unjustifiable business revenue plus fines.
UBS thus recognized, more or less, that it was an instrument of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in fighting for rich customers, a secret secret.
After that, the Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same as it was before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The customer's money has begun to flow.
In the course of a few months, the Bank lost confidence in both of its main areas of activity - investment due to poor speculation and asset management as a result of aid and the promotion of tax evasion.
And it was all calmed down and it seemed that the UBS was able to break the situation, that this crash happened to a trader, and the only trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before they noticed in the bank that something was wrong.
Clearly, risk management in the investment division is not working yet.
“The Adooli incident has clearly shown that risk control has not changed well,” says Martin Jansen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at University of Zurich.
The finance director of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: “UBS has no risk control tool”.
It was for a long time that caution made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world ' s largest assets - not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether or not peace had collapsed outside the Alpine Republic.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of immutable reliability, as Lindt and Springli symbolize fine taste in chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich is still in line with the image of a worthy Swiss private bank - only slightly larger.
Its location is a classic.
The main office of the bank is located in Zurich on Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station straight to the Lake Zurich, surrounded by snowcapped Swiss mountains.
The buildings are luxuriant, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops of Confierie Springli, such jewelry firms as Tiffany's can be found here.
Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the palace of Credy Suisse and elite private banks, such as Julius Bar.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
There are big leather couches along the marble walls next to the symbol of the bank, the big safe sign.
UBS knows what his clients need - reliability.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point gave up the Swiss concepts of banking - or the head of one of the small Swiss banks believed they had betrayed them.
He doesn't want to see his name in the paper, like all Swiss bankers, he's working with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large - particularly in investment banking, where Anglosaxes are very active.
In his view, the Swiss had nothing to add here.
"And if there is anything, then they've long adapted to the Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon's investment banking that changed UBS, brought him the first big profits, and then failed, and no other European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
“In that environment, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of the country,” writes Lucas Hessig in his book Krah UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of SF 68 billion (about Euro45 billion) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could you get to this?
When asked by Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was established, which was too big for little Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank which continued to grow.
The two banks that formed UBS complemented each other; one was a rich but advanced bank specialized in the management of assets in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment banks suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to turn an all-powerful wheel.
Two names relate to UBS growth: Peter Wolfffly, Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Osper, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I've always thought Wolfley and Oppel were a dream team," says banking analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulffley, brilliant intellectual, modest and profound models and statistics, and Ospel with his internal instinct, which went all the way up, starting with an intern in a bank."
But Osper finally relied on Wolfley.
And Wolfffley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were real," says Geiger.
"This is tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
The UBS members well remember the meetings of board members, where Wolfley always repeated the same slogan to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was the head of the “Turnier Table”, where the success of the banks was achieved.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make part of it.
UBS was the largest player in currency and public securities.
The Commissioners of Management, however, pointed to a weak point: according to the parameters referred to in the banking terminology as “permanent income”, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failures in U.S. mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS engaged in a adventure that almost cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in U.S. substandard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that brought together securities based on American mortgages and sold them further - continuing to carry risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought it until the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire," says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the height, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to go after another as attempts to clean up the bank were more difficult than initially thought.
UBS posts have become a child chair game and remain unreliable until now.
It is almost impossible for anyone to take the lead in this huge bank.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that turned its back on all existing business models.
Geiger's banking analysts already have the idea of abandoning investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting their Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not (yet) ready to go this far.
However, it is clear that investment needs to be significantly reduced.
The new head of the Bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was in fact viewed only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
Since then, he has been able to demonstrate his character and now, as the Zurich Bank stated on Tuesday, he has led the UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to return the investment bank to what it was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
Those questions must have been asked by Axl Weber.
He still said publicly that he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe drag down the United States Stock Exchange
The upcoming recession in Europe worsened the attitude of American investors early in the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome has had little effect.
The fall in industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the womb.
The general relief that followed the changes of Governments in Rome and Athens was not backed up.
The euro fell relative to the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek cups were still considered half-filled, not half-empty -- but now the problems come to the fore again, said Mark Luskini of Janey Mongomy Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones industrial index closed at 12.078 with a 0.6 per cent drop.
The market barometer fluctuated between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The larger S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, falling by 1 per cent.

Industry in 17 countries in the euro area has significantly reduced production and adapted to the end of growth.
Eurostat Statistical Service reported that in September companies produced two per cent less than in the previous month.
"We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe was unlikely to be quickly shaken by the recession and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
The legend investor Warren Buffett was able to only confirm these fears, and in an interview with CEBC, he said it's still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do what it takes to end the crisis.
In his view, therefore, it was too early to invest in European State bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a ten-year-old principle into the garbage basket and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM, worth more than ten billion dollars, was raised by almost one per cent against the trend during the sale of shares of this oldest company.
The shares closed, with little change, at $187.35.
Buffett stated that he had paid an average of $170 per share and now had a 5.5 per cent share.
The share price of its investment company, Burkshire Hathway, fell by 1.3 per cent.
Bank of America's shares fell by 2.6 per cent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted almost all remaining shares of the Chinese Building Bank into cash, delivering $6.6 billion.

Deliberate Ravens Fill Cities
The players are seen as problematic birds in many places, experts say today that these very smart birds will no longer be able to be expelled from cities.
Some people like birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible; crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents who complain about mud and noise are becoming more and more frequent in many communities.
A solution to the problem of birds, however, has not yet been achieved.
At the first symposium on crows, in the city of Lear in East Friesia, experts argued that the players could no longer be expelled from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for Alternatives in Cities
Conservatives argued that the main problem in cities was the migration of specially protected players, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture had increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction and cutting down traditional nesting trees have made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under protection.
The city of Zest in Westphalia and north-west in Yewer, Dipholc, Achime under Bremen and Lere has large colonies with more than 600 parents.
A mixed project to shoot the crows in Lere caused unfavorably newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described the trap of birds and the beating of sticks as a particular cruelty.
"The usual movement and fortification don't do anything," said architect and landscape designer Werner Clever of Lear.
The removal of the nests of water or tree scraps often has undesirable effects, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Würtemberg.
“The living are scattered, and large colonies are divided and extended to other areas.”
Dilution is possible only through exceptions to hospitals, homes of the elderly and schools.
"We're going to have to live with them. "To get rid of them is not an option."
The urban problem will not be solved in isolation from the surrounding areas, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kälner.
The combination of preventing birds from being protected in residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
The information stands were a slogan proposed by psychologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be sure of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information on the lives of highly intelligent players is provided on information displays.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also expressed her opinion about complaints of bird noise. "The noise transmits a lot of information, and they have to say a lot of things to each other."
The gamers often use tools not only to grab a piece of them but also to make them themselves.
Conduct researchers at Cambridge University recently tested a bird's mind on four players.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they needed to knock on a plank in order to extract a mole’s larvae.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to break the tablet.
In another experiment, creative players had to solve a more complex problem.
The researchers put a small conductor with a mole larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get the beak.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and hooks to hold the handle behind the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four players have dealt with this for the first time.
Ronaldo brings Portugal to Euro-2012.
The hopes of Bosniacs and Turks for victory at the last minute have not lasted long.
Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the last seats in the Euro-2012 championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the guidance of the superstar Krishtian Ronaldo, who had been killed for 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina at 6:2 (2:1), ideally forming its fifth output into Europe after 0:0 in the first phase.
The Czechs were sufficient to be 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of the ple-off against the outsider of Montenegro after a clean victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia has not lost its chance by playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland has easily achieved 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Poschtiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloza (80th) killed the rest of the goals for Portugal.

Portugal had already driven Bosnia out of the 2010 South African Peace Championship.
Portugal made an excellent start at the Lisbon Ashtadiu da Luz.

A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-range power by increasing the score to 2:0 with a 25-meter mark.
The Bosniacs who did not open the account in the first half an hour were given their first opportunity thanks to Edina Jacob.
The former Wolfsburg player from Manchester City, England, sent the ball with his head to the lower edge of the trouser, but the ball did not cross the gate line.
Jirachek kills for Czechia.
Then, Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was the focus of his attention.
Following the attack on Elder Poschtig in the Bosniac fine area at 36 minutes, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was simulated and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a questionable handgun behind the game after Fal Fabiu Quentran - Misimovic implemented it.
After the break of the 2004 European Vice-Chipion, four more points were added to the account.
Peter Jirachek cleared up all remaining doubts about Czechs for the 81st minute.
European champions are sent to European championships for the fifth time in a row.
The trainer Michael Bilek and Bundesligi Mikhael Kadlettsa and Thomas Pekhart (1st FK Nuremberg) also smiled at their success after a mistake at the very beginning that could have been catastrophic.
Peter Cheh's gate for the ninth minute, thanks to an instantaneous reflex, prevented a potential car named Tomas Siwok.
Montenegro's best chance was when there was a duet of Stevan Jojetić and Dejan Damyanović.
Damyanovich struck from the edge of the fine area for 40 minutes and almost scored the goal of Chehu.
After the break of the trouser, she saved the already chach's world-class needles after FK Seoul left the field for 50 minutes.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, in the meantime, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0.3 in Istanbul, the Turks were unable to play better than the 0:0 in Zagreb.
Although there is now little doubt that Coach Gus Hiddink's coach will now free the site on the bench of a team that reached its third seat in 2002, Croats are for the fourth time on the final tour of the European championship.
The Turks have almost been able to launch 31,000 spectators in Maxymir Stadium in an ideal manner.
Seljuk Inan's long shot hit the stand at seven minutes, and the attacker Kazy Kazim was unable to pull the ball off the grid.
Croatia has since woke up and increasingly seized control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent shape.
The Legionnaires of Bundesligi Daniel Prunić (Bawaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintraht, Frankfurt) were in the field with Mario Manjukić of the Volfsburg team, who took up the 62nd minute seat of Ivan Perišić from Dortmund.
Trapattoni travels to Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first trip to Europe after Germany in 1988.
Coaching team Giovanni Trapattoni -- who already looked confident after winning the 4:0 in the first phase -- captured leadership for the 32nd minute thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Constantine Vasiliev of the guest team compared the account to 57 minutes.
Ireland took a good turn from the beginning, but it was only 23 minutes before Robbie Keen from Los Angeles made the first clean nude shot.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender was able to prevent it from taking Ireland forward.
Goal was hit for 32 minutes.
After bypassing the protection of the Pavlandack needleman, Ward found himself in the right place and fired a ball across the line, changing the score to 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software producer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of its workers in China over the next few years.
The company on the Dax leaf reported on Thursday that it was about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) to invest by 2015.
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and hire thousands of people," said Bill McDermottt, one of the executive directors of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
A state of 2,500 people must grow to 4,500.
The world market leader for industrial software plans to double the number of offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Some 4,000 SAP clients out of more than 176,000 worldwide are in that country, which is experiencing an economic boom.
Counting on China ' s growth is an important component of the 2015 strategy of the company, which is part of the Dax leafing company.
SAP plans to increase its turnover to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, Waldorf earned about 12.5 billion euros.
The business of a software provider with 55,000 staff worldwide looks better than ever.
SAP has been in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to scale up our operations," said McDermottt.
“Our objective is to achieve sustainable growth based on information in China.”
Mass killings - human dimension
The intense and very good new book by Peter Eggland, "Dear and Grievance: Personal History of World War I", begins with a long list of actors from which the heart is at rest.
Here's how to read the following: Carefully cut this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very closely as Mr. Englund reports, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your lighthouse, at a time when, like one of these men and women, you will fall off the road and be lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book he wrote right now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as "an anti-history work."
It contains few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are hardly any ambassadors, ensnared journalists or discussions of tactics and warfare techniques.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, but it's a book about what it looked like.
The book Beauty and Grievance has brought together the experience of 20 more or less insignificant men and women from both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone is going to fall into captivity, lose a hand or a leg, go crazy or die.
Their lives are dying here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are dying at that time.
Mr. England's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
It is also an amendment to the notion that World War I was only a heavy trench war on the Western Front.
Beauty and Grievance skillfully provides a panoramic view of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are bee hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is tsetse flies.
It's a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smokeless dust.
When the canonade comes near and you're a woman and you're at home with the kids, will you stay where you are or run?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on and why we have to fight in this war.
“Weakness of facts”, observed Mr. England, “recovered by speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours”.
Beauty and Grievance is the fate of people like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German mariner of the High Seas.
Their stories are mainly from memoirs, letters and other published material.
The stories of their lives may be frightening or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to Mr. England ' s small moments and tear-off details.
Many of them are about deprivations and how to deal with them.
When he tells the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "It's German everywhere."
"Replacement, counterfeit aluminium, fake rubber, paper tendons, wooden buttons."
He's still talking about erzac food in Germany.
He describes “meat made of pressed rice cooked in the ram (and adorned with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potatoeskins; footwear broken with wood”.
He notes that there were “837 registered substitutes for meat allowed in the manufacture of a bulb, 511 registered substitutes for coffee”.
Some stories tell of honor and courage.
One American notices the urge to be cruel and says of war, "You feel that after all, this is what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, a evening newspaper or bestseller, and to claim that this display is a civilization and that there is not a barbar under your painted shirt."
On the contrary, a British soldier notices that he is likely to die without being noticed or upset.
"When a man comes to accept the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think it would happen to the public," he wrote.
But it's the other way around, it's scary to think of a man who's been hanged in secret.
Other comments refer to old Europe, which is falling apart, and to new forms of fear.
"Conflict was increasingly an economic competition," said Mr. England, "war factories."
He notices the arrival of someone whom he calls "a new species in the venereal of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-buttoned suit that sets up a massacre sitting behind a writing table."
People act in an unanticipated way: low-level actions are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund described soldiers who tried hard to get sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes in order to avoid service on the front lines.
“The grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhea, which the soldiers bought and brainwashed in their genitals in hopes of entering the hospital,” he writes.
"He was rubbed into his eyes by the despairers all the time, which often led to life's blindness."
Transmitted by the Swedish Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible but non-breedingly appropriate for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how war “freed completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are starting to ask why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books of World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as "The Western Front Without Change" by Erich-Marie Remarca, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. England ' s book is part of this shaky pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final that I can remember in the uncanny literature.
I won't tell him.
But it was as if he had reached a page with a list of characters, grabbed it from your hands and set it on fire with a match.
After the last error - a well-designed raid
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because in Zukotti Park there was to be less people at that time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few high-ranking officers, and the others first said that they were leaving for training.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of events, and his presence emphasized the importance attached by the Police Department to the operation.
There could not have been a repetition of the episodes of recent weeks, such as the use of list gas against protesters, which was contrary to the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupiers.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police rescue operation was launched against Zukotti Park protesters.
The authorities were preparing to observe occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on Randels Island, calculated at Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot exercises - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police - with reference to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of East River.
The order to enter the park came at "the last minute", told a source familiar with orders that referred only to the assignment as "training".
"The few cops I know and were summoned to the case didn't say they were being sent to Zukotti Park," said this man, who was talking under the conditions of anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were in the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons for this secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but they withdrew before hundreds of protesters, who were in front of the appointed timeline when they heard of those plans.
The operation involved members of various police units, including the force from the districts, a police team, who were usually used to control criminal surrounding areas.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as much as work, come and leave the park during the day, making 1 hour of the night the right time to arrive.
"It was right to do so when there was less than a people in the park," he said.
Rescue vehicles with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pike Slap and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The searchlights and prerecorded announcements from loudspeakers seem to have intimidated many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue winds, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
The police reported that the tents did not touch until 1:45 a.m., giving the protestors time to collect the items.
Other police teams, according to eyewitnesses, met on the perimeter to enter if arrests were required in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, representative of the head of the Police Department, said that this was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see the police and that the police had treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that television cameras on Church Street, along the western boundary of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went west through a pile of personal objects of protestors, including bags, plastic carpets and polyethylene bags, full clothing, the Sanitary Department teams followed her by collecting what was thrown.
Some of the protesters who refused to leave were pulled out, and the photos soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protestors took positions near the kitchen camp, at the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police entered, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp’s epicenter held themselves together.
And two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Rescue personnel were called to cut down the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clean-up operation was completed about 75 minutes later, and the police reported.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 persons had been arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “distorting public order and resistance to detention”, he said.
The highest officer in the field was Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the department's wanted police, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “did not direct the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
The second group of policemen was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case we had to get inside.
The barriers were placed on Courtland Street, a quarter north of the park, and on Pine Street, a quarter south of the park.
The observers saw the police expand the perimeter from these positions even further beyond the Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people further away.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped into the roof of a police car, while others, according to the eyewitnesses, released air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one protestor were hospitalized.
School Service Staff Union will sue the city for dismissal
The Union, representing hundreds of school staff members who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students were enrolled.
The trial is probably the last means available to the union of District Council 37, which is trying to cancel the dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, the coordinator for working with parents and other employees who were among the lowest paid workers in the city lost their seats on 7 October as union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to allow the city access to health funds managed by workers ' groups to close the hole in the budget last spring.
The city officials categorically rejected this charge.
At a hearing in the City Council last month, the Chancellor of schools, Dennis M. Walcott, said that dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One Board member steamed by telling him that nowhere in the budget had there been any indication that school support staff would be dismissed.
Representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had filed a notice of claims, warning the Department of Education that a claim had been filed against it; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce the formal application to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The action will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City and will list eight temporary lay-offs, all black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen the claim and was therefore unable to comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the New York Times complaint, the union focused on a number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools lost more assistants because they were underfunded chronically.
He points out that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and few in the Upper East Side or Tribeki schools, 17 school assistants lost their seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the Southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working in 36 free secondary schools in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the claim states: “It is not the areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill the budget's deficits”.
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way in which additional funding was calculated for every poor student who is enrolled in school.
The Union also argues that school principals may have been misled by the language of the notice allowing the dismissal of focal points for dealing with parents.
The notice used the word “excess”, although the word “exceedance” is more frequently referred to when a teacher in the school's payroll is moved to a list of existing employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents' coordinators were dismissed," says the draft, "not just translated."
Mission over, Congress ready for Libya Agreement
It seems that Republicans and democracies on the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the Libya uprising.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, the old dictator Muammar Al-Qadhafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee should consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (democracy, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republicn, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who commends the Libyans for the good insurgency and the United States troops for “freeness”.
“The purpose of this resolution is to honor the courageous people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country,” said Kerry.
“This is a confirmation of the support of both parties for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but no other debate on Libya has taken place easily.
During the summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the language of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCaine submitted a resolution that allowed for the limited use of United States armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the two parties and never put to the Senate.
But the same day the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber did not support a proposal that would reduce funding for the United States operation in Libya.
It left an American mission in a kind of legislative purgatory -- when Congress was angry enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so bad as to actually knock the soil out of her feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overwhelmed by events.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels and Kaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially concluded on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs is “beloved by the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary steadfastness in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in a military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “reaffirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Do new measures fully support the Foreign Affairs Board or divide legislators like the June Bill?
The latter was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Republicans on the Committee.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, this week the House of Representatives is to vote in favour of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a major legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some democracies in Congress.
This measure, proposed by the member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlat (Republicn, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary of that Congress.
Other legislators have not yet been able to amend their legislation to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Hudlat Amendment was only one of 68 constitutional amendments addressing a wide range of issues that had been raised in that convening.
Some duplicates - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 revisions to the balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and some other “control over federal expenditures”.
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors — mostly newly elected Republicans who wish to grace their summaries — the opportunity to boast that they “proposed” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which took place in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supported the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen wished to limit the number of members of Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives, José Serrano (democracy, New York), wished to lift the two-year limit for the President.
Congressman Jessie L. Jackson Jr. (democracy, Illinois) proposed many amendments guaranteeing, inter alia, the right to quality education and health.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriages has been proposed for years, as has another one prohibiting flag burning.
Some legislators also wish to allow the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states object to them.
As members of the Congress sought to propose amendments, they were not moving faster than in previous years.
In the 111st Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th Congress 66.
This rate would be no different from the early 1990s, when Congress members, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment, which was adopted - the 27th - was approved in 1992, but was actually made to Congress in 1789.
"Broke but not defeated," says Giffords in his first television interview after the attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot her in the middle of a public event in Tusson, Gabriel Giffords, a member of the House of Representatives (democratic party, Arizona), appeared on a federal channel on Monday evening, baked a tune from the Broadway show “The Sun will return tomorrow” and said that she wanted better health than going back to Congress.
Upon arriving at the 20/20 A-B-Si-News program with Diane Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty formulating proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her a difficult way of recovering from the trauma caused by a bullet that crushed the skull and pierced the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the bill on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang and called her recovery "hard".
To Sawyer's question, how does she feel, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the 20/20 edition of the hourly special issue, which was shown on the eve of the release of the new book "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope".
The specialty described the reconstruction of Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
In the video that Kelly made in the first few weeks, she's on a hospital bed with a skinny head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physical therapists are teaching her how to do simple things.
Croak your head.
Pull out the lips.
And then her first word is "what."
A few days later, Giffords made the second word, "the toast," asking me to change the menu of breakfast.
The ABC video shows that music played a central role in Gifford's recovery: we see a congressman singing along with "Girls Just Wants to Have fun" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Patty.
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she doesn't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband told me that he was reading an article in the newspaper about the shooting on March 12, when she stopped him for the first time to ask about the six people who had been killed at that time.
The suspect, Jard Lee Laffner, is detained in Missouri prison and subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"It's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
When she was cured, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not defeated," Kelli said.
You're only beaten.
And you'll get through this, you'll get better and come back stronger than ever.
Troops Feel More Compassionate Than Respect
The event was a Wall Street festival that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock had a ballad of helplessness, disappointment and loss.
At the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines lined up around it.
The audience in the tuxedo applauded him.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraising.
The senior military officer at the concert, also attended by the then Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," wrote an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was a pity.
The opposite is illustrated by the difficult relations that have developed between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired, American public.
Troops are wasteful of their praises for their sacrifices.
But the praises have their own price, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were feeling pity for people in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who was commanding troops in Iraq and is soon leaving for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy."
This is a sensitive theme for military commanders who do not want to appear to be unappreciative or unappreciative of the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger experienced by returning troops in recent years of war in Viet Nam has been much worse.
As a result, most of the talk of pity takes place quietly and only between war veterans.
After two of his sons had returned from fighting in the Marines, a retired Colonel, Mark Kanshn, warned them that non-military men would look into their service from two perspectives.
Some will look upon them with admiration because they have besieged the rebels and have been in exotic places.
Others will wonder if “under the mask of an evil veteran”, said Kanshn, who fought in Iraq and, upon his return, held a high government post in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he says, he felt that some interviewers were cautious about whether he would be able to cope with the strain of responsible work in Washington right after the fighting.
Kanschen remembers him saying to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on a negative effect."
The awkwardness experienced by the military is partly due to American indifference to wars.
Winning the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism as it was in World War II,” says Lieutenant General David Bairno, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mainly focused on the depth of the soldier ' s suffering.
Troops estimate the number of campaigns they have undertaken, the number of comrades they have lost, or the extent to which they have lost.
The army is facing increasing pressure from supporters of the fight against rape
This week, the historic court hearing must decide whether 28 men and women against the army are to be sued for non-rape action.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next one.
Elisabeth Lyman's first class, who was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, claimed that she had been raped by her fellow worker during the night.
It was in October 2008, and she was returning to her barracks at Miramar airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend, and met a male employee carrying a package of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could come to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," Lyman says.
But a woman in Texas had her fears shattered.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't obey my instinct then."
A few minutes after they went into Lyman's room, the man came to her behind her, dropped her and raped her, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former members of the armed forces will look forward to the court ' s decision at the historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the action they have brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rasmfeld will be brought to justice.
The claim states that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The case filed by counsel Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., in February originally included 17 plaintiffs but increased to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by their colleagues and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecute or bring about proper justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting the army tops because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Burke also said that since February she had been contacted by some 400 other victims, many of whom could take part in future claims.
Her strategy is, instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case -- putting all the eggs into one basket, so to speak -- she's going to open up a lot of things if you need to keep pressure.
The Defence Team from the Ministry of Defence, led by the Federal Prosecutor, Neil McBride, took steps to close the case.
The judicial documents that Newsweek received reveal a defence strategy - mainly that former or current soldiers cannot file military claims for damage suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court Decision, the Federal Government is not liable for damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs”, states the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially prohibited from fighting, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear frontline.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers ' teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contacts with local women in the combat zone.
As a result, 150 female soldiers died between the two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for armies to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are being prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academys accused of promoting women ' s hate atmosphere.
Separately, a non-profit association of American veterans of the war in Viet Nam prepares a suit against the army, at the centre of which are diagnosed as “personal change” by victims of violence in order to remove them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati of a human rights group, is known as the Organization for Action of Women Military Officers.
Her team had filed a complaint against the Veterans' Office in December, accusing him of having discriminated against the practice of considering applications for pensions from people who claimed to have been subjected to sexual violence during their service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were introduced into Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry ' s Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service, 3,158 attempted rapes were reported.
But it is known that attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon ' s own estimates, this figure represents approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examined the percentage of cases: 20 per cent of known cases had been brought to trial, half the number in the civil justice system in 2010.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case call the attacks on them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she claimed to have been raped into the military police less than an hour after it had occurred.
That night, she said, she was asked to share details of rape with police, doctors and commanders on 11 separate occasions.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the assailant's blood was found on her bed, from a cut on her hand.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting before a judge at a hearing during which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive characterization to the accused, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to face--I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember my commander saying, "It wasn't a trial on him, it was a trial on me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her personality change, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with adverse language, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether Lyman's case and his associates are moving forward is a complex question, says John Terry, a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: “In my view, they are capable of moving forward.”
Between them and the verdict is the doctrine that has been criticized ever since it came into existence.
I've been critical of the doctrine of Feres all my life.
The army has lagged behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and deterrents that impose responsibility.
He adds, "It's very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will change only when decent people want to fight.
If they do not benefit from the hearing, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform,” she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
The walls have eyes: how researchers study you on Facebook.
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Braywick was a regular guy presenting his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braywick, who had confessed to the July massacre in Norway, which had claimed 77 lives, was present at his first public hearing.
Although Breavik may have been acting alone, he was far from alone on the Internet, spending a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, sharing with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy, we just have to get on Facebook.
"We realized it's easy to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report on the European cyber-populism of the British DeMOS Research Centre.
The personal data reserve on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the website's advertising tool to highlight the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy -- what marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then promoted them, but instead of showing them a new group or a diet product, the ad invited the user to conduct a survey that asked them about their level of education, their attitude towards violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, over 10,000 participants from 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries were able to interview without even leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not as impressive: online parties to right-wing groups - most often young men who are not satisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with off-line activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who hide behind the monitor."
DEMOS is just one example of Facebook becoming a popular new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends, as expressed in the "Lakes", posts on the wall, and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three records per day, Facebook “super-actual information” is causing a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the title of the site by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook’s beauty is that it provides an opportunity to study people who cannot be approached on the street with a notebook.
"Early, if you wanted to interview the people of the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to join the party and they would never have accepted you," Bartlett says.
"Fastbook excludes all of this, you're addressing them directly."
Others say that the site could identify and study social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Whisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who were discussing their drinking exploits on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent on the matter.
Moreno suggests that students' peers, such as their hostels, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often renews his drinking status.
"You can't solve the problem without discovering it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christkis, co-author of Moreno and Director of the Center for Child Health, Conduct and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We have found a way to identify children from the risk group who would not otherwise be found."
Facebook also constantly extracts various data about its users.
The site ' s data processing team has processed the status and day statistics of Valentine ' s Day, the turnout of voters in mid-2010, and the National Happiness Index (mostly using information that they only have access to - cyberbowder champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not, in exchange for the opportunity to play Skrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become involved in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict standards for off-line research, online data are publicly available.
"I don't think many users at least think that the researcher can observe their profile," says Neil Selwin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, "about a study he conducted in 2006 using publicly available Facebook students' pages.
"As they imagined, it was only between them and their friends."
Then the question of methodology arises.
Even off-line does not guarantee that the subject matter of the study is highly honest.
It is not possible to know on Facebook how much information in the profile and on the user's page is true.
"What you're saying on Facebook, and what you're doing outside Facebook, two completely different things," says Selwin.
That is why, despite his years of work in the field of technological research, Selwin believes that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools available for use.
"Nothing can replace entry into the real world and contact with real people," he said.
"It is assumed that social research is about social, and most social research is still about off-line."
“Cold and inhumane” Anders Bering Breivick will be publicly tried for the first time
Anders Bering Braywick, a man who confessed to the double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during the first public appearance in the Oslo court.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and Knights of the Templars of Norway”, he said to the 500 in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit my actions, but I don't admit it."
Judge Torquel Neschheim interrupted Brevik during this monologism because he “did not wish to give Brevik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views”.
For the same reason, he refused to allow Braywick, who had brought a written speech with him, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Neshaim also ordered the police to keep Brevik in detention for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from having access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take close control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Brevik in the eye, others to make sure he's locked up.
All came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhumane," told the Norwegian channel NRK, one of the survivors of the Utto.
"It was uncomfortable, but I felt a little better myself after I saw and heard the suspect."
The dark-dressed and blue Braywick tie kept calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked in the eyes of the journalists and survivors as he entered and left the building.
Despite Brevik's strange idea that he was part of a large “resistance” movement, the judge held that he was not crazy and said that there was no evidence that he had been dealing with accomplices.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that is now felt by the entire nation.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but it's not," said one victim's relative.
"It would have been much easier if it had been."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, shown at the theater this week.
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Designer of Modern times.
But what Apple fans can think of as the biggest discovery in a recent interview that was mentioned in advance of pre-commencement in major markets this week is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and thought he was hippies, but he was also a good organizer and modernist of the production process, who believed that many business leaders were suffering from "the disease to think that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea separates a huge amount of skilled work from a large product."
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley was setting up a TV series of Triumph Nerds about the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, it was about 10 years since Jobs had been expelled from Apple, and he was already working for his new computer company, NeXT, waiting for a massive Internet development.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in the Nairds, he says that the originals of the interview were missing in transportation.
Only after Jobs died was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
The material, which was slightly edited, was the basis for a 68-minute film by Steve Jobs: A lost interview in Landmark Theaters on that Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man who is known for his hatred for detailed interviews, Jobs seems untapped to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different moments during an interview, there are long intervals between questions and answers -- reflections of 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where it appears to be irritated by Kringley's questions, causing him to move more quickly to issues or events of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar era, the ipods and the iPhones The Lost interview is something ominously prophetic when Jobs assesses what he sees different companies doing right and wrong and offers his own vision of future information technology.
It's one thing to read about the posthumous estimates of Jobs' work, but there's something wounded and inspiring in Jobs that we see here, a disturbing dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should have been.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned how to run a business:
And I said, "Why do you do this?" and the answers you always get are, "Oh, that's just what you do."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks in business very deeply.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his efforts to streamline reporting in Apple.
A structured way of recording costs, often starting with “standard costs”, which was taken from the ceiling and then picked up by “clarification”, he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to track business expenditures to small amounts.
About a joke about the Pope:
Jobs tells us in detail about the "blue box" that he and Steve Wozniak had made, a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls free.
There's a lot of writing on the device before, but Jobs' euphoria is here describing the blue box as an act of power being contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a telephone automat, ordering a conversation, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until as many stations as possible were connected.
"We've reached the Earth's half a dozen times, and you've been yelling into a phone automat, and it's coming into a second later in the next car phone," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we've learned is that we could have made something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both knew a little bit, but we could have made a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, Apple could ever have come along.
Jobs continues to describe in detail a famous show he and Wozniak had practically managed by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the pope to call, trying hard to copy Henry Kissinger.
When different members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to an American diplomat, the two were laughing right before the Pope himself was raised to answer the telephone.
About technology in love (and Bill Hewlett's cold name):
At the age of 12, after hunting spare parts for collecting a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in a telephone directory and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job in Hewlett Packard.
"It has had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I've seen at the age, and it's shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of HP staff who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer."
He was about the size of a suitcase, he had a little monitor with an electron beam, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and spin around that car and write programs for her.
Concerning improvised innovation:
In a few places, Jobs talks about inventing new products in summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of installments, a buyer asked him to collect an entire computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think of both the assembly and the delivery of the ready-made equipment.
Later in Apple, he remembers the difficulties he had with developing a computer mouse:
"I remember a fierce argument... they shouted at me that it would take five years to collect a mouse that would cost 300 dollars, and I was sitting on my throat, and I went out, and I found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to raise for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
Large companies losing energy:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs predicted exactly how many of the industry's leaders would veer in vision and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copyer or printer, so what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these types of people] who eventually come to run companies, and people making products are being pushed out of decision-making.
The gene of the product that led to this monopolistic position is replaced by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products, the required skill.
This is what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could capture the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times more, he could have been a Microsoft in the '90s...
They were defeated.
On innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea of a great product separates the great amount of skilled work... when you spread a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises that you need to go to -- some things you can't force to make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts -- bringing them together...
After all, it's all about taste -- it's about trying to express yourself in the best that people have ever done, and later about trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We were always ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh made famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had become the best information technology professionals in the world.
Had it not been for information technology, they would have done amazing things in other areas.
Skalia and Thomas will have lunch with the opponents of the Health Law while the court is hearing the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would hear the challenge of the health law of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonina Skalia and Clares Thomas, were praised for a meal sponsored by a legal firm that would challenge the case before a higher court.
This case took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One case on the agenda was a motion supported by 26 states challenging the rapid review of health care adopted by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists throughout the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; indeed, a turning debate of 5 1/2 hours is expected to take place in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be at its height by the time the judgement is issued.
A lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the health law must be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney General during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clement’s legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped to sponsor the annual lunch of the Society of Federalists, a long-standing group of conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the Pflizer Inc pharmaceutical giant, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The lunch was held at the Washington Hotel hours after the trial.
There was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a prominent opposer of the Health Law.
Honorable guests at dinner?
Nothing new: Two judges have been attending the Federalist Society’s events for many years.
This does not conflict with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free of the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they did, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judge may attend the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honorary guest or be mentioned in the programme of such an event”.
Nevertheless, the apparent proximity of Skalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as with a company of high financial interest, was sufficient signal for ethics activists in the Government.
“It is a shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code, contrary to the statements of some judges, that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the General Affairs.
"The judges drank and dined on official fund-raising activities with lawyers, whose cases are currently pending in court."
Their emergence and assistance in collecting money for this event undermines all allegations of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Skalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say they are very willing to mix court cases with groups like the Society of Federalists.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a prominent conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives claim that this is an ethical question for Judge Elena Kagan, not for Skalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal officer in the Obama administration when the first judicial objections to the law were filed at the first-instance court level.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan never showed that she was going to do that.
Boeing receives a record 18 billion aircraft order
Emirates aircraft ordering 50 wide-scale Boeing 777 ships and possibly order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Human Air, the transaction value is over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company receives a 50-unit order for its products.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co., and the price for all these 50 planes is $18 billion.
It's very important where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing gold lived future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, a Chicago company estimates that 2,520 fixed-wing aircraft worth 450 billion will be needed in the next 20 years.
Boeing denounced its largest dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft this weekend - 50 two-pass Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy 20 more aircraft that will raise the total price to $26 billion, said Boeing in Dubai, 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which could boast of much better fuel savings and passenger comforts.
The price of six fixed-wing aircraft is more than $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neil Dior.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for aircraft, but they also have higher fuel prices, which are usually detrimental to airlines, since this is one of their largest objects of expenditure, which is not so destructive because the country earns money at high oil prices.
That's important, because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel ordering planes when prices go up, said Dior.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the market for wide-breeding aircraft and helps prevent a rival, Airbus SAS, from attacking his domination with his airliner A250.
The Boeing victory on the show took place four months after Airbus stated that he would postpone the debut of the largest A-350, which competes with exactly 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the load after the buyers demanded an increase in the capacity and range of flight.
The Boeing Co equity grew by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico apparently lost in the elections in Michokan.
Louise Maria Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped the opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IPR in the run-up race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón appears to have failed to implement her application for the place of Governor Michokan during the violent public elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers had helped to induce a race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IPR, is the leader in the Western State Governor race.
"The interference of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michokan, but also for the whole country," said Louise Maria Calderón on radio interview the day after Sunday.
"They intimidated our candidates, our workers in the elections... "they took ballot boxes, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for IPR.
The IPR ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She's preparing her return, and winning Michokan is an important step in this attempt.
The IPR hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to be just a little overrun by Calderon, who led the ratings until election day.
Calderón, a candidate for the National Action Party, or PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate for the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or ADF, now owned by the Governor ' s chair, came a third, a serious defeat for the divided and failed left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to accept preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state of Morella, denied association with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to accept the results.
Drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines had long dominated Michoan.
This is the native state of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the elections, when he advocated for Louise Maria Calderón, and several candidates left the local electoral race out of fear.
For the IUL, however terrible the elections in Michokan will look, victory will give the party a driving impetus.
The man who was supposed to represent the IPR in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging before next year."
ADB is convincing Asia to help save the eurozone.
The Asian Development Bank committed India and China to helping save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that would halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director of the ADB's office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing large economies must “do whatever they can” to accelerate the re-establishment of the currency block by either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties “insensitively” and said that Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help to avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"We all care about it."
"That's why anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be somewhat protected, but it cannot be incontrovertible."
"So if China and India can help, you have to do it."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italian borrowing has increased dramatically, and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe has given rise to fears that it could once again lead the world economy to recession and has led to calls for major developing economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any Asian assistance would be carried out through IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial assistance fund bonds, funds to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided enormous power in the negotiations to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce, said that India would do what it could to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We have enormous challenges, and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a prerequisite because where we find work for tens of millions of our young people."
Others argue that for developing economies like India there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Warshni, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult from a political point of view to assist Europe with 1.2 billion Indian people, of whom some 800 million live on or less than $2 a day.
"At some point they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go on holidays to the sea, and it won't be taken well," he said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why the reserves of India should be used to maintain Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers in poorly organized, losing enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis threatened “significant direct consequences” throughout Asia.
The ADB forecast of 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now facing “downgrading risks” due to a threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed “emergency plans” to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon ' s fearsome warnings of potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panette, set the stage for the Congress on Monday, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already accustomed to reducing by $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now afraid that further reductions of 600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress is unable to reach a cost agreement.
“The effect of these cuts will be devastating for the Ministry,” said Panette in a letter to the senators of the Republic, John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the Congress ' s failure to adopt a budget agreement and the resultant so-called sester initiated a global reduction of 23 per cent and the termination of many new projects.
“This intense reduction, so thoughtlessly applied, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three quarters of the ship or the building -- and seriously damage other attempts to modernize it,” wrote Panette to the senators.
"We will also have to lay off many of our civil servants and, as the reduction will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to lay off the civilian staff in order to achieve the goal."
“These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and seriously damage the readiness of the armed forces.”
The reductions ultimately affect the military, said Panette.
“While military financing in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the Sevester, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious disruption in core budgets”, he warned Panette.
“Contract personnel will be reduced, resulting in the cancellation of contracts and an oversight contract that supports troops.”
“Staff personnel will be reduced, resulting in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago requesting details of the possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
“The effect of the sester in the Ministry of Defence will be the rapid fall of the United States as the leading world military power.”
"We stand against these dragon acts," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday evening when they announced the Panette's letter.
"It's not the way we can live with it, and it's not the way we should impose ourselves."
“Secvester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether the Panette letter or recent senators' warnings to a budgetary compromise or whether calls for the release of the Pentagon from reductions will be reinforced, we will see later.
The Panette was absolutely sincere about possible reductions, although he had come to work with the Pentagon leadership after years of budgetary expertise in Congress and the White House and aware that he was facing a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a disheartening picture of what might follow -- a troops with a coat but without a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a unit without bullets."
"It's a wing of a plane without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," said Panette in his opening remarks in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from an unstable war spirit, poor readiness and inability to fight potential enemies."
"It essentially encourages aggression."
In its letters to McCaine and Graham Panette, the annex provided further details on how reductions “frees significant operational risks: slow the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be first in deployment and respond to the world; and lead to unacceptable risks in future combat operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects might face obstacles, including those that had already been tested, and some only in the early stages of planning.
The list includes a single F-35 strike fighter, a planned new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarines, a new coastal zone warship and a new ground combat vehicle which the Army and the Marines require to replace the Hammer.
Cessation of further development and testing of F35 may save 80 billion dollars in 10 years, but its supporters say it is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other opponents.
How to Get a Lie
A quick look at recent headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in daily life.
The presidential candidate for the Republicans Herman Kane is engaged in questioning allegations of sexual harassment by several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania was charged with false testimony, as they allegedly concealed that the retired football coach had raped the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
The Congressman of New York and the Internet-expungionist Anthony Weiner exposed himself as a fool, denying his findings, which was quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
A former presidential candidate, John Edwards, was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to cover up extramarital relations.
And again, none of those who lived at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
The stories of fraud at school and college exams are common.
There were times when teachers gave students answers to their own tests in order to have a good assessment of their performance.
Teachers who have to teach the contrary send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In one day studies show that you may be lied between 10 and 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to salvation.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in their first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Lying or lying is a necessary skill, for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game that looks like, say, charades where you have to say "Founded!", the detection of lies is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the study is that most of the old myths of lying have been dispelled.
Liars look into the eyes.
They don't always stop, stutter, turn red, or laugh.
It should not be concluded from this that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
An experienced lie detector can reach the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the blurry, the structure of the questions and the time-frames.
I have spent several years researching scientific discoveries in an extensive and ever-increasing segment of lies, and it is clear that the detection of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recrutinizing, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are excellent at reading to others, making them feel free, controlling their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more about others, usually to protect someone's feeling that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried people (but the lie they say is most often lying).
We also know that if you are perceived as a deceiver, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do I know if anyone's lying?
First, observe your object's normal behavior.
It's called a baseline definition.
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing changes further.
Watch the position, the laughter, the voice characteristics of your object.
It is good for you to know whether a person knocks on his feet permanently, and then you will not make an unjust accusation when you see a knock on his feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then search for groups of deceptive notes and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceivers can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet towards the door, they can bend to the exit, they can change their position in a certain way, or they can show "the ease after the interview" -- this exaggerated breath of relief and a change of position when all the difficult issues are behind them.
Investigators often falsify the end of the interrogation to just look at this relief after an interview.
So, notice the talk of your object.
Scott Peterson is known to have fallen and used the past time to claim that his murdered wife is alive, which led to her search throughout the country.
People who are attractive can also use distance in their speech: "I had no sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinsky" or repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical note-based indicators are barely catchable.
Someone can use "skill language" to answer a complex question: "Okay...to tell the truth... as far as I know... as far as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There's no magic to detect lies, but you can learn to detect deception.
Such skills will increase everyone’s chances of becoming victims of skilled crooks in professional and private life.
The oil pipeline counter-plan needs to be revised after the U.S. threat to delay its approval
A few days after Obama ' s administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- instigating the anger of trade unions, but by calming environmentalists -- a company that is about to build a pipeline -- claims that it will be willing to reconsider the project in order to resume its work on it.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sand Hill in Nebraska and was confident that the project would still be approved.
The company made this decision at a press conference in Nebraska State Capitol.
The representative of TransCanada, Alex Purbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually be approved by the oil pipeline, albeit on a different route.
This happens after a statement by the State Department last week that he will postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until he explores new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Sand hills of Nebraski and Ogalala aquifer, a huge groundwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise commissioned by the Department of State is likely to postpone the decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although the authorities denied that the decision was political.
Obama, in a written statement last week, referred to the decision as an appeal by the State Department and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline must extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He's going to have to ship 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to Texas oil refineries.
To do this, he needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but he loves trade unions that hope for approximately 20,000 jobs related to oil pipelines.
But the legislators of Nebraski, who oppose the plan, are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand Hill and Ogalala Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department's study of environmental impact showed that the project would have only limited adverse effects on the environment, but a source in the energy industry stated that the Department's auditor had commissioned a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Eliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the programme.
The other was whether the selection of the firm that had been hired for the initial study was inappropriate, since it was linked to the TransCanada.
Patty La Bell was sued for allegedly causing a child to feel stressed by fear
The New York City family claims that Patty La Bell's disco-divorce began to wake up in the lobby of their house in Manhattan, scaring their young daughter to the point where she was terrified.
The Tirada of Lady Marble was so frightened by the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk that she endured “individual change, sleep disorder” and “the intense fear of strangers”, says her family before the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on 10 November last year when Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten teacher, Rosanne, and Genevieve were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosenna Monk went down in the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and dropped her daughter down for a minute.
"Somebody came to me from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
La Belle angrily rebuked a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosanna Monk.
I said to her, "I don't care what you're saying or thinking."
She got furious and started using grumbling -- word for C and word for F -- in elevated tones ...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from a bottle at me.
She said Genevieve had a tantrum.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
La Bell attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escorts had to hold her back and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanne Monk.
The baby was crying so hard she was tired, she added.
Later, the family sent a note of apology to La Bell, but did not receive an answer.
Counsel and representatives of La Bell do not respond to calls for comment.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not reported, but family lawyer Sam Davis said that he had taken up the case free of charge and that the family planned to contribute any money he would receive to charity for children with cancer.
"The goal is to force Patty La Bell to take responsibility for his act," said Davis.
"This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate problems have slowed the economy
During the first year of the reign, Mario López in Sinaloa had increased unemployment and illegal labour, foreign financing had decreased and the economy had been weakened.
2011 - which will be part of the economic history of Sinaloa as the occasion for the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés, also known as the Year of Change, which has given rise to great hopes for economic development, but in view of the adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been recorded, but the main indicators of economic development have been reduced.
The low temperatures of February have not only resulted in millions lost to the agricultural sector, but have limited the potential for growth of the public economy by reducing economic activity by a total of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on areas affected by frost provided by the Council for Sustainable Rural Development of Mexico, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were entirely affected, while the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected, with vegetables, maize and tu.
The decline in economic activity caused a continuous increase in unemployment in the state until November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters the unemployment rate was accelerated, between January and March of 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloa were unemployed, from 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, the share increased to 5.28 per cent in the second quarter, and from July to September it continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a proportion that is more than 74,000 people unemployed in Sinaloa, an increase of 18,969 from the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa has been the subject of many factors over the year, for economist Gerardo López Servantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (USA), the increase in unemployment can be attributed indirectly to actions taken in public policy.
“What we are seeing now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market, with the aim of limiting the resources imposed by the law, which was adopted in Congress to combat money-laundering, because it is not easy for people who illegally own dollars to work with them, to invest and use them in something”, he said.
Resumed immigration
López Cervantes said that there is a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of employment abroad has been limited in the United States, primarily because of the difficulties of entry, and in the second because, once they enter, they already face a great many difficulties in finding jobs, so that a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, resulting in an increase in unemployment,” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is becoming worse when attention is drawn to the large number of violations that dominate working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the state ' s active population works without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregular treatment, another reminder of work in the state is provided by low wages; in the state, the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was until September of 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, which is 7.375 pesos.
FDI reduction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and high unemployment rates, 2011 saw the largest outflow of foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, between January and July, State FDI had reached $630,697. This represents a drop of 87.74 per cent compared with $5,143.312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the State Department of Economic Development has recorded only 17,280,000 pesos during the year, mostly from service companies.
Debt
Against the backdrop of the economic recession, the state government requested in July, during the State Congress, the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no debt advantages were expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government, Mario López Valdez, shows a lack of capacity on the part of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011, there was a lack of harmonization among various sectors, including the state Government itself.
“The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really low, has to work hard to regain the positions lost this year, in 2012, we must redouble our efforts, we have not been able to agree upon the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new Government team, we hope that next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic retardation
López Loredo said that events such as early freezes this year had hampered the state economy and its efficiency and growth.
“The low levels of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was the slow economy, which is not fast enough to create economic dynamics that allow for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations,” he said.
Revision of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state must continue its most dynamic production activity.
"Well, we found that we were working on it, and we believed that there was a need to develop a long-term programme that would change the direction and economic course of the state, to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa had,," he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Caparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better guide the Government ' s efforts.
“Well, in general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, in terms of economic development there is little progress, but it's important to develop a long-term programme,” he said.
He noted that the current Administration had demonstrated progress in its own public policy manner.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is beginning to get involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government realizes there's more to do," he said.
He's sentenced for eight kilograms of marijuana.
Five years ' imprisonment and a fine of 100 days ' income, such a sentence was imposed on Navolato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney-General ' s Office reported that the sentenced drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was convicted of a crime against health, in this case possession of marijuana for distribution.
In the case of AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during patrol of Cypruso Valdés, prior to Post No. 80 in Al-Qastillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck, carrying a black bag in a box in a car and a small backpack in a passenger seat where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seized person was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused remains in custody at the Centre for Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions to work are required
Public works related to programmes such as the Family, the Rescue of Public Space and 3x1 for migrants risk remaining unfinished or delayed owing to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes had so far developed, they were in danger because the State Government was unable to make the relevant contributions, which amounted to an amount exceeding 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent had to be contributed, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year is over, they haven't given us a penny when they were supposed to give us a piece since the beginning of July," he said, "so that we don't delay, we've started work and they've made great progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not make the contributions it was supposed to make, so at the beginning of its reign, the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that had not been made available in the case of the State administration.
"This happened to us in the previous administration, because the state had no financial opportunity to participate, and the programmes continued to evolve, and this year, to gain access to these programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state had left behind," he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that a request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that interest on them would arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year's over, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court will approve a “digital television transition” in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice (UB) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which has carried the so-called “digital television transition” from 2021 to 2015, since the eight votes required for its cancellation have not been obtained.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mess, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his mandate by issuing a decree detailing the actions to be taken to move to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because there was no qualified majority of the eight votes required by the court to express itself on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree and it remains in force.
The draft declaration prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the decree should be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right enshrined in the Act of the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofethel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margaret Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On the basis of this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and to support complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to in it with regard to the transition to digital broadcasting.
It was also decided at the Ministerial Meeting to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the draft in the sense that the federal executive could not determine the general rules of action for which the public administration should prepare.
“I also do not believe that if this were to happen, it would affect regulatory autonomy”, and recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the administration of the State.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals, one of the most important changes in recent years, has resulted in better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of conversion to digital form, which included meeting public needs, which had not only a technical dimension, “because it covered economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These questions, he said, “require the work of the whole system of State economic governance includes a group of authorities which the Constitution unites into the State executive branch”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital broadcasting exercise and had done so with the help of the Executive, despite the existence of specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded, therefore, that the Government, in adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of the Congress, ensures that the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly are respected in the administrative field.
In Michokan, the possibility of counting "voice by voice" is being analysed.
According to the PRRA, the difference between the first and second seats in the Governorial Elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of counting “voting-by-voting” is real for the elections this year in Michoacan, where, according to the Provisional Results Programme (PARP), the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes, 879 of the total of 6.074 protocols.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Michoana Electoral Institute (IVC), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Saragosa, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the Electoral Corps adopted a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the State Constitution or Electoral Code or the Electoral Law Act, since the State Congress had approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process and Governor Lélèle Year-Radge had not included its publication within the time frame stipulated in the law in the Official Gazette of the State, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (CJJJ) ruled on the constitutional claim made by the local legislature and called the State representative's vote on constitutional reform “unvalid and illegal”, since he was not entitled “to permit or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of “voting”, Maria de los Angeles Lianderal argued that, with the adoption of suitable principles by the General Council of the IWL, it would be possible to present a partial or complete count of votes to the local electoral body.
For example, partial counting of one or more ballot boxes may be done on the condition that: the results of the records do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting of documents in the urn or it is not in the Chair ' s possession; or where there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, the overall counting of votes in all ballot boxes may occur when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the elections in question and those who obtained the second seat in the voting is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that, at the beginning of the session, there is a request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition that presented the second candidate.
The total counting will also be done if it is determined at the end of the normal calculation that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a petition from the political party whose candidate has taken the second place, in the event that the ballot boxes have been deleted, which have been counted in part.
It is worth noting that this is the case with elections in Morelia, where, according to the PRRA, only 0.16 per cent of the difference between the first and the second place, even with 129 votes, out of a total of 923 protocols.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinam, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot, Felipe Basio Cortés, arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; on Monday, a inspection and a quiet Mass were conducted.
According to the family, the Lieutenant Colonel's last will was to have his remains scattered in the mountains of Zapalinam.
Following the acceptance of condolences along with other people who had died in the disaster, the Basio Cortés family returned to the capital, Koaouila, on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, and attended the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the Colonel's remains arrived at a chapel located at Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he was examined by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and a football team, of which he was a member during his high school term.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinam, he always told his family and friends," was what Sandra Cortés Basio, the pilot's sister, said.
In her view, the Lieutenant Colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes he was at the peak of his life, “he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother devoted to his family”.
He left Saltillo very young to attend the Air College in Sappan, Khalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he had a head held in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "when he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to greet him as when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan to attend his relative’s diploma ceremony, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life — driving an airplane.
He's been led on his way.
The shots were fired after Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortés Basio, headed by Governor Jorge Torres López, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technical High School in Saltillo, where he was studying in 1985, making progress in both education and sports, and guided him on his last journey.
Basio Cortés recently died when the helicopter he controlled suffered a crash, along with the Secretary of the Provincial Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the remains of Basio Cortés, a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral office of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major James Martínez, on the esplanade of the training school where his family had already waited, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Christine, her mother, her brothers and other relatives, his pupils and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned at NL Kaderate farm
A few hours before detection, the military authorities had shown 11 persons in the media who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in various parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Kaderate Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The find was found at a height of 1.5 kilometres along the Kaderate highway towards Santiago, in a commune known as El Castillo.
A few passing by noticed that a village house with a wall painted in a beige and a brown wall had an open gate.
When they looked inside, literally three metres, they found three bodies, they immediately let the relevant authorities know.
One of the men was wearing a yellow shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
The body of another person, in red shirts and blue jeans, was located almost three feet [1 m] in length.
All three were lying face down.
According to the evidence collected there, three people were killed elsewhere, as there were no hits on the ground.
There are signs in the village house of one organized criminal group of another, and there are several bullet holes in it and in the gates.
11 caught in Kadereit
The Ministry of National Security has provided 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that was mainly in the municipality of Kaderate and accused of abductions, killings, “frauds” and clandestine graves.
According to published information, eight people were detained in Los Alvero colony initially on 11 November, and one was taken hostage.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, requiring that they become members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another development took place on November 12, at 6:00 a.m., when military personnel made a patrol tour of the village of Olda Rancho in Kaderet, when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the cabin.
After leaving them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a patron and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, on 13 November, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Prauda, who, when he saw the military, tried to escape.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of Henaral Teran, Hina and Kaderate.
A new Italian Government will be established on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce a new Government that will face a crisis that has placed the country on the verge of economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present a new Government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the verge of economic disaster and damage to the entire eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace said that Monty, who had been appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President on Wednesday, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form a Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive branch takes its positions.
Monty said that he would present the results of his talks with the political parties to the President in his attempt to form a Government.
“I wish to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to escape this difficult period”, said the former European Commissioner to reporters.
Monty did not explicitly say that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The art is now well framed," he said.
Monty has completed the process of government formation in less than three days, which is much less than usual, as Italy has been struggling with a political and financial crisis that has brought their debt to a critical level.
Under the leadership of the former European Commissioner of Monty, the administration must approve the rigid savings required by European leaders in order to regain confidence in Italy.
On the basis of pressure on Monty to hurry, unstable markets have established a 10-year increase in income from the BTP bonds of Italy over 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian Employers' Federation, told reporters after meeting with Monty, "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monty ' s chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said Angelino Alphano, Secretary of the Centralist Right Party.
Support for the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the majority government, which is made up of technocrats, which Monty forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular reforms of severe economies.
Any closure or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased pressure to warn that Monty’s failure could be a disaster.
Monty started his consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He'll finish his meeting Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday of Napolitano, which allowed an extremely rapid transition to respond to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the value of Italy's debt had now reached a critical level in the face of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern financial advocates of the eurozone.
Monty said that his Government would exist prior to the next elections for 2013, despite widespread projections that politicians would only allow him time to undertake reforms before appointing new elections.
Monty said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insist that it should be composed of only technical specialists, demonstrating their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and opposition by the parties complicated the attempt to include political figures.
Spaniards have more play experience than Ticos.
Of the 22 players reported in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international matches.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 matches.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, compared with 22 players who were summoned by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rating, have a list of class A voting games, Tricolore only has Michael Ouman's attorney as the only one who has had 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernández stadium.
The Spanish football players playing in the League of All Stars and in the powerful clubs of the Prime League of England were very active this year in the league and local tea competitions, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
To that end, we should add the Spanish furry experience in the complex skills of the European Union or the World Cup.
The players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCAAF, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he is the head of the list in the Spanish prefabricated needle, Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (a match played by 0-1 in London) echoed the record of Andoni Subsarret's ex-natives, with 126 international games.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record at 127 international games for Spain.
Javi Hernández, Barcelona player, 106 matches.
Casillas and Havi were identified as the best last week by UEFA, along with another player of the Iberian team, Sub-zarreta, with 126 matches and a bomber, Shalke Raul Gonzalez, 102.
Almost 100 Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Havi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Injest with 62, Cec Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica, next to Michael Umana, the left side of Hunior Diaz, with 48 matches, and the bomber Brian Ruiz, with 45.
Further, only five have crossed the 30-game line: Calor Nawas since 31, Randall Asofeifa from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Hernández from 36 and José Luis López from 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain at Gérard Pike (37), Ceregio Buskets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raoul Albiola (31).
There's Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest of them didn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moral has only four games, Hordi Alba has two games, Victor Bolivar has only one in Costa Rica, and Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet been debuted.
The leading Spanish player, David Villa, has 50 points followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz became the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernández and three times as much as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quinette included the country on a 20-year career tour
The visit to Costa Rica is a dream.
In an exclusive interview Viva bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the group was ready to give one of the best concerts the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There was more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says it is also a dream for them to play in that country.
This was the claim of bassist and founder Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview from Viva, Brazil, last week.
The team is located in South America as part of a 20-year tour of work and on Sunday, 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they'll be speaking at the National Stadium starting at 7:30 p.m. with a team from Los Angeles The X and a local group called Las Roberttas.
It's an extract from a conversation that has full decryption available online in The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, you know what your fans are going to experience?
The trip to Costa Rica is a dream for us, too.
This is just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's going well.
I was only in Costa Rica once on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're very happy to bring our music there.
I'm asking because there's a kind of loyalty to the group; the fans live under stress on the days leading up to the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for having been with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, while waiting for your concert, view it as the biggest show of a year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in São Paulo, and we hope it's brought us into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, with regard to these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her surfing waves?
We have a lot of friends in the surf, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarido, and the waves are incredible.
My friends always go to Costa Rica and Nicaragua and Mexico, and these are great places for surfing, and that's how we learned about it from people who love surf.
Looking at the tour, you might say you made a big show with lots of songs.
What are you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We're going to try to make the best show possible with a wide variety of songs; we're going to try to play a few songs from every album and present to our fans a great variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does it work?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we might have forgotten them.
It makes the show more interesting to us and so I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This tour marks 20 years of your career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us could have imagined that we would be in a rock band and that we'd been doing this for over 20 years, making it look like a dream.
We are delighted with our luck, and we are very encouraged that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
For us, everything is going to be very good.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the bloom of the grage?
It has always been an honour to be part of this group of large groups.
We're good friends with the Soundgarden guys, Mudhoney and Alice in chains.
It's great when the movement comes from a group of friends, and it's unusual.
From time to time, one group from the same city appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and we are honoured to be part of a group from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, and we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be part of Seattle's sound.
It's also very strange that a group like yours has stayed together in the same composition for so long.
Yeah, four of us were 21 years old together, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we're taking care of others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, music roads have also been opened, giving everyone the freedom of experiment.
We trust each other's music, and everything could not have been better.
Your attitude toward the word was not easy, but your success made it possible for you to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find a balance sheet?
As we grew up, it became easier to find a balance.
We care not to be on tour too long because it's easy to get into this big crowd game and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people here are for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what you did without choosing to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Master Love Bon?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at the beginning, it was great.
We've been a group for almost three years, and we haven't released any album, until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There's been a lot of disappointment, because it's been so long, and most importantly, we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferwezer) and Greg (Hilmore), who started out with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a picture, I think about the incredible person Andy was, and as he made me laugh, it's always been a pleasure to go to work, to laugh, to talk about music and football and a lot of other things.
It was a great man, and we miss him.
The local team Las Roberttas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yeah, the producers sent us some video proposals, and this was the group that we liked the most, so we can't wait to see that Las Roberttas can offer us a live one, and that's supposed to be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing Yellow Ledbetter's words at concerts?
This is a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he's using the first one that comes into his head.
Who affected you like a bassist?
There are so many of them.
Among the first to come to your mind, Mr. Butler, John Entwil, CJ Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCarthy, Chuck Dukovski...
There are so many of them I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the grand, even though he's no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel some isolation from the word grage.
When I think of him, he reminds me of the groups that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone that came in at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music now better than ever.
At first your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How will you explain this change?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the album that might seem easier, but there's songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark though they might sound a little bit positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, and those songs were very dark.
I think when you're growing up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or a friend, these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect this for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was again hospitalized for medical examination
The ex-President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the State Hospital and his family doctor informed him of the loss of muscle strength in his legs.
Fujimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer of the language, which led to his being operated four times and under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Agina, who is his personal physician, told TV channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Agina said he believed that Fujimori should be a candidate for pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He transferred four operations to speech cancer, lost 18 kilograms in weight, and other diseases, such as severe erosion gastritis, pancreas bones, kidney stones, high blood pressure and leg hemorrhaging, were listed by the doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Office of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by means of an army destruction unit operating secretly during his first years of government.
Muhika is on her way to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, headed by President José Muhika of Uruguay and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive this Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political issues of the region.
Muhika will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderón, the most important item of the extensive plan of meetings with the political, commercial and Uruguayan authorities and meetings with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by Uruguayan authorities.
The meeting of the two Presidents in the city of Guadaluara will be “a welcome exchange of information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership has published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking support from Calderón for Uruguay in an incident involving France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included South America on a list of tax havens at a G20 meeting in French city of Kana.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remained tax havens, a statement that raised Uruguay ' s protest and withdrawal for his Ambassador ' s consultations in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the Group of the most developed and developing countries since November in G20 and has, in effect, an agreement with the South American country since January of this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has in recent years tried to expedite the conclusion of tax-sharing agreements in order to leave behind the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's “series list” drawn up from countries that do not enjoy international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have, since 2004, been implementing the Free Trade Agreement, which has increased trade between the two countries.
This is going to be three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land.
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Pech from the evil feet of Boser, but he's never done it before in three dimensions: at Super Mario 3D Land, he'll fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The publication that will be available in shops around the world this month has been created taking into account the characteristics of the 3DS portable console, which allows three dimensions to be played without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell us how the stereoscopy will work without glasses," said Nintando's head of the press service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game specially designed for this platform," because until now successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that, despite the existence of 3D, Super Mario 3D Land was a “accessible” video game that made it possible to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" has two games in one game: the first part is "simplified" to attract less experienced users.
Once you start, most experts will go to the second circle at the game levels, which are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between “D agggressive” or one that affects only the depth of action, but on which they have to play three dimensions in order to overcome various obstacles and “not to give in to optical illusions”.
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the hero ' s return to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo blinks at the fans of the show and repeats a successful formula from previous games, and the mustache conductor needs to pass through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Pech.
However, the player will find new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as Luigi's "player."
Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo had begun to hold him accountable in the United States for the 70 million dollar laundering plot.
This concludes the process in which Guatemala responded to a request from the northern country that required the extradition of Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, bearing in mind that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he did not “tangle hands” to legal decisions and took all extradition procedures that he had ever known.
Together with Portillo Sergio Roano Marroxin, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug sales.
What Colom has done shows the execution process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted in order to prosecute the head of State from 2000 to 2004.
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (JC), the Portillo will be extradited once with the decision on its legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of its human rights.
The Portillo was found innocent of the waste of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove's social support organization are important: 6,000 young people who are exposed to social exclusion have helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
More than a hundred jobs created for this social group should be added to this.
The anniversary was the occasion for a ceremony held at the old factory of Fabra I Coats, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove came into the world next to Trinity Vele in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or vulnerable to marginalization.
Yesterday's Sant Andreu celebration brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that cooperated with the association during the past 25 years.
Different political representations during the elections showed the unity of work done by Trinijove.
Following the President of the Generality, Arthur Massa, and his predecessor, Hordi Puchol, an ex-consultant of the Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and an ex-tendant of the Mayor and the current eco-cialist member of the municipal council, Richard Goma, attended the ceremony.
The present Social Welfare and Family Adviser, José Lewis Clerice, and CEO for the Social Work of La Caixa, Haume Lanaspá, also appeared in Fabra I Coats.
He said that Trinijove appeared at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work done so far “is a good base”.
The President cited Trinijove as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and the hope of people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not new to the organization and work done by her," he said.
The captured building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated
Capturers occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmez Street, 51
12 o'clock yesterday at noon without fighting
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living in 51 Balmez Street is nearing its end.
Twelve people left the building voluntarily at noon yesterday, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that irritated their neighbors, on the basis of a court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, there'll be a security check," said the manager.
Scotters, who seized 11 out of the 13 floors of the building, the rest were settled, assigned all electricity and some water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially alcohol banks.
The first three floors were a mass party site that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Right behind the building is a nightclub, Balmez 51, which has also been damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, informed Europa Press that since the occupation, her income had fallen by 80 per cent.
The club owner said that the owners of the building had dragged her into an unfair competition because they were selling drinks for three euros, while they were selling them for ten.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to neighbors ' complaints of noise, although she observed that the noise was not caused by the visitors to the club, but rather by the inhabitants of the squawk and, above all, those who attended the parties that were organized there, whose frequency and intensity increased, according to angry neighbors.
The club owner said that the inconveniences were so great that she had even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months he had “forgave” her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks there had been more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The President of the municipal group PP, adviser Alberto Fernand Diaz, demanded last week “an immediate evacuation of the building in order to solve the problems of coexistence and the common spirit of the neighbours and the degradation in this area”.
A popular leader explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before summer, but over the past few months, the Scottlers had invaded all floors and virtually every room and that some of them had been hacked.
In that sense, he added that “we must put an end to impunity and resist the culture that is being created in the building”.
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building to Nou Barris.
At 15:30, the police drove to Montral Street, 35 after receiving a phone call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the possibility of a competition following a dispute over contributions
The 16-door municipal competition resumed debate on the role of Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now extinct Barcelona Capital Corporation (SCB), this administration printed promo-letters for Kolserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the SKB, in 1987 the park regained a place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Calonia, one of the few that were oriented not to the north-south but to the top (mountain)-down (sea).
Colserola's position as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as Yoga bear.
It was so until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Kolserol.
The gates mean the idea of the park, of course.
Either that or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
Is there one question: Collserola or a park or a mountain?
The competitions, and their organizational side and their impact on the city, are topics for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most repeated topic discussed when two members of this elected clan come to know each other in the elevator.
This fact has led to one of the few coincidences between the three architects of Barcelona and the scholars present.
Miguel Roddan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: The competition is appropriate
For Rojdan, once the coastline is reached, it becomes "necessary" to discuss "the front of the mountain," when the proposal of Ildefon Serd, a mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
"We must assume that Barcelona's biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, because of its excellent accessibility.
Colserol is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Kolserola's gate" contains a "word trap": we should not think of them as "the entrance to the park, but as limiting certain areas where we should operate."
Modolo, as Rodán and Bayon with city-building experience, called the proposal an "intelligent task" with "some hazards".
Risks arising from "uncertainty of public space forecasting" following the experience of the 1980s, which ended in the Forum area with a swan song.
The first fear is actually a limitation of the boundaries where you can build.
“Restriction of something is the preparation of the next step” means transition.
“We need to think about new urban planning instruments because the current [for the capital master plan (GSP)] could lead to a real disaster.”
Closer to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Collserola Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, and not" as a purely topographic question.
Modolo remembers that there's work done outside Calserola that's "don't miss your ears", although he's grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers his profession to join this project "from the beginning."
Moreover, it is understood that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a gap that allows architects to enter the debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is what should lead interdisciplinary teams (“success”, he claims), which should have created: “The architects should only be an instrument”.
Bayon suggests that the answer to the question which raises the title of this part is complicated, since the rules of the competition lack the general kind of Collserola: "There were 16 overlapping competitions," he says, "in the sense of the sea-mount, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
This makes 16 competitions, at least in his case.
On the other hand, a project for one gate may overlap by programme and definition with an architect project for neighbouring gates.
From your point of view, the council has the task of guaranteeing that the band directly above the Rhonda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazabal and he will be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the judicial representative, Red Casino, pardoned the mayor ' s brother Monterrey in proceedings against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazabal will be released after the legal representative Red Casino granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which is in the process of extortion against the mayor of Monterrey.
Following the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution so that the Monterrey authorities could authorize a secret operation in the gambling house.
After a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened criminal proceedings against the mayor ' s brother and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old capital of the State.
He remained there for 49 days, following the requirements of the second order prohibiting movement after the prosecutor had excluded offences of bribery and organized crime.
He was transferred to Kaderate on 19 October for allegedly extortioning half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with an average degree of isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving in the municipal prison in San Nicolas in Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yanes, who said that after almost two months of investigations, it was sufficiently clear that Jonas was guilty, such as a 1.5 million pesos charge from bookmakers in exchange for the authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for pardons for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released in the following hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor of the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gómez whether he had recovered the damage and who of the partners of the gambling house granted pardon, although counsel tried not to make the name known.
On the basis of records 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrazabal, and no statements on the process planned against him could be made thereafter; no reparation or punishment would be required.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 15:50 p.m., Larrazabal Breton was ordered to be released immediately.
The court officer, Jorge Janes, went to San Nicolas Municipality in Garza to inform Jonah that he had been legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hakomé describes the details of the disaster, where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others were killed.
The Minister of Communications and Transport (MTS) reported that the results of the accident in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake More, and seven others died, had shown that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in a state of complete integrity without an attempt by the pilot to make an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hakomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found that the weather was suitable for flight.
"Elements which appear to indicate that the ship had several contacts with the ground, wings came into contact with trees 25 meters where the vehicle lost its flukes."
He also reported that the ship was intended for 19 persons, respectively, to meet the necessary requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that the studies carried out in the impact area did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
“The study states that there are no components of the vessel elsewhere, and that the impact is in a state of structural integrity.
"The aircraft was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for the transport of passengers.
The ground in this place has a slope of between seven and 30 degrees.
At this point, the Secretary said that the main thing was to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeroports and Support Services, said that during the impact, the presidential helicopter was operated at a cruise speed and that it had occurred on a soft rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a regular flight manoeuvre at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of SCT, Perez Hakomé, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation regulations, the flight was subject to visual flight rules, which means that the crew should have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft went to the border area between the city of Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It may be that because of the cloud conditions, the team was looking for a zone of lower height and greater visibility in the valley of Quernawaka.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the latest recording of the aircraft radar are likely to coincide with the loss of control or change of direction.
Small area debris:
The information available so far indicates that the impact was on the front line and the side line.
The fragmentation of the debris indicates that the helicopter has encountered land in structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of a fire or explosion:
Unfounded evidence remains in the disaster area of ship debris, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent research has shown that there could have been multiple contacts with the land.
During operation on the ground, pieces of aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground ranged from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts which appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several land collisions.
After a thorough study in a larger area than the identified area near the site where the disaster occurred, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in structural integrity.
MSS announces a program to search for the obesity gene
Social protection leads a study on the search for a gene for obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, which is called the “Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence”, which will provide weight-related evidence.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Biochemistry Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 21st Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been gathered.
The team is assisted by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Institute of Polytechnics (NPI).
The study invited the population (whether prescribed or not) to participate in MSSI sports centres participating in the study to the Mexico Valley, where tests involving children will be conducted every Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be maintained at a sports centre in Kuautemoca, western Mexico State, and that since 8 October, activities had been held at a sports centre in Nesaualcootla, eastern Mexico.
Once the target of 500 to 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Independent Sports Centre (South Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the essence and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risks among children and young Mexicans in order to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day will be celebrated, and the main goal will be to bring together 3,000 children and adolescents between 6 and 14 years of age with parental permission and supervision to fill out individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family inheritance diseases in order to avoid risk factors leading to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that the Saturday would include anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, growth and coverage of the waist), blood pressure and glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz López said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals at the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicated that there had been an increase in only six years: in the case of boys, 77 per cent had been obese, in the case of girls, 47 per cent; in the case of overweight, there had also been a significant increase,” said MSSI.
He said that the rationale for the search for markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans were descendants of American Indians, 30 per cent descendants of Europeans and five per cent of Africans, and that this condition had an impact on genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main result of obesity genetics is the body’s inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and it is kept fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants was a comprehensive assessment of the children, which could determine whether they had any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the existence of dark folds on the neck (ante) and forearms means the possibility of a breach of metabolicism and even prediabetes.
Information is provided in all confidentiality, and doctors transmit it in writing to their parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in the way of life that need to be made in order to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there were three main reasons for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyles, lack of daily physical activity, most of the day at home in front of television and use of short-distance transport instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie consumption, i.e. increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tal, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic predisposition analysed in the program.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Raphael Herrera, a UNAM chemical research scientist, has developed a polymer-moderated bitumen to produce a best quality mixture that is environmentally resistant and temperature resistant.
If the signals sent by the road surface were to be taken into consideration, it would be necessary to repair some 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the capital area of the Valley of Mexico City, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, researcher of the UNAM Chemical Department, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of asphalted road surfaces is correct, the number of pits can be reduced or reduced to zero.
In his lecture, the Technology View of the Holes read in the International Year of Chemistry reports that the Laboratory for which he is responsible is developing a polymer-moderated bitumen to produce a mixture with the characteristics close to bitumen but with the best resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather was extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus counteracting the formation of pits.
He explained that the bitumen, the most heavy part of oil, was a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of the high molecular mass known as asphaltons, and others the low molecular mass known as boys, which together gave the road surface its characteristic viscosity.
The obsessive behavior of the bitumen is the fact that, at a high speed of about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it remains almost stable, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance to street asphalt is not constant, but changes over the course of the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineer.
He observed that the streets of Mexico City were mostly covered with a flexible coating made up of six layers of material, the last three of which included bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen, made up of small stones, dropped in bitumen and then compressed.
Every stone that makes up this surface, he said, is loaded in bitumen.
When driving and exerting effort, this helps the forces to be very well spread over the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, said a chemical engineer.
On a sheet of asphalt, he added, was placed in the last layer, called the worn-out layer, which is made of a small stone, actually a sand that is also immersed in asphalt.
Since this is a layer that will be in contact with the wheels of transport, it should be more resistant than asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and disseminate these efforts, wear and tear also requires proper thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
The weather, especially humidity and temperature swings, were also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it had a significant impact on asphalt.
When the soil is raw, the water enters the surface and is difficult to escape from it, causing all layers of coating to soften and thus create a hole.
When creating a pit, he said, the first one was worn out and only then affected the bitumen, but the damage did not happen overnight, which should be taken into account in the first signs of ongoing maintenance programmes.
Also, a member of the National Research System explained that transport loads are another important factor in the formation of holes and therefore the thickness of each layer of coating must always be related to the transport load and this requirement must be guaranteed in order to prevent frequent pits.
Rafael Herrera said that much still needed to be studied and done about bitumen, such as bitumen emulsions, which in other countries were already on the market and even helped to make holes easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What didn't the Valle candidate have to do to become a new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serna Melina Ramírez from getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Valle obtained the title of Princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca only wants to get Miss Colombia's crown.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna was supposed to be content with the podium of the winners with a silver crown and a tape proclaiming her new princess of Colombia.
In view of the results achieved last evening in Cartagena, where Ms. Atlantica won the crown and the scepter, the department has 14 named princesses, and Melina joins the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but who were declared princesses, including Mérias Ospina Benoit (1947), Klara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Patricia Belini Aala (1979), Lorena Alvares (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Léila Blance (1988), Monika Evers (1989), Maria Sonsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hissay Alhure Garcés (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie Harris Alhure (2008).
The question that many now ask:
Because the result of the defeat of the main royalty, which in each of the presentations showed that she had everything to become a new Miss Columbia, was not simply that she was elected by the Queen of the Police and the most beautiful person in the Vergue version, the titles that the Queen had, like Tatyana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who were given the crowns of Ms. Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her First Princess title was that she was unable to give a convincing answer to the question, "What book do you have in mind and why??" given by Martin Murilla Gómez of the literary society, let's read.
She replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of education, and I certainly believe that the book that characterizes my childhood, Little Prince, is a pretty deep book.
I am reading "Crime and Punishment" today, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; I am also reading the book of Irina Nemyrovsky, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "The Hot of Blood."
The answer that the jury did not like because of the term “cultivation” and, secondly, because he did not explain specifically how each of the books quoted described it.
But after Melina's ceremony, she said that she was calm and satisfied with her outcome: "Enoughly wise, what is going to happen."
And all of you, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince is a great book."
Among the sounds of the hypotheses, Valle was burned by favouritism.
The reporter from Bogota suggested that, because she was preferred, she was met with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster's culinary competition, the spectator's vote for the best national suit, and Queen-Math), "which provoked the jealousy of the other women candidates, caused the queen to become stressed and as a result she did not shine on the stage."
And it was during its first appearance in the bather at Hilton Beach and in two of its evening coronation shows.
Although she was confident in both of them, it was clear that she lacked the strength and energy that Magdalena and the Atlantic women had shown.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN's As Home program, said that the fact that Milena was named Princess “denotes that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition does not become queen”
In addition, the representative of Valle had recently avoided communication with the press, and that had been wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed in her attempt to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the Krasot National Competition.
That's why two days before the election, Lucy Doti, a member of the international jury, said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must look not only at the appearance but also at the public consciousness before they compete, they must already be involved in the projects," she said.
It is also suggested that Valle's representative had sinned with defects on the berries and fibrosis she saw on her stomach, but it was questionable, since the jury had highlighted her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, considering her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen Jorge Hernán Orosco's consultant notes that Melina had no better body than she had, "but the problem of fibrosis on my stomach, which was not very visible to me, caused her to lose her glasses on the last day."
However, journalist Guido Ojos of the magazine Cromos believed that the error of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she had been subjected to surgical intervention.
"Operations are good, but the representative of Valle doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize first given by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, a fierce prediction came true last night, it was said that it was a woodpecker who Raimundo gave to Melina as compensation for losing her pleasure in getting a crown.
Whether that is the case or not, the fact that Melina now has a year of government, not as a queen, but as a princess, is the position that allows her to represent Colombia at an international competition designated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
But it will go into history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in getting a crown.
That was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A criminal from Cali has a story about how a man who confirmed Alfonso Cano's death.
The work of these officers is key.
On November 4, CTI C.I.C.C. came into history as a man who confirmed the identity of the head of FARC, Alfonso Cano, by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI forensics, this week it was the turn of Eliseard González, a Puerto Tehad man who had spent 21 years in the area of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Choko, where he often had to travel over five days through the jungle to reach the places where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valla and, after completing his courses, became an expert in forensics, where he studied the friction of the skin, i.e., the palms and the walls.
During the week of Eliseard's identification operation, known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take up his clothes for no more than three days.
Something big was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived on a helicopter from Cauca to Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify the two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to a man who had led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Saenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the place where the body was located, he did not identify him by his outward appearance; he was very different from what he had shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed as a local farmer, without glasses and much worse.
But prints don't lie.
Using a magnifying glass, ink, blade and flashlight, Elzar compared the fingerprints of the body to those in the pictures.
His eyes did not let go. It was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that he was the leader of FARC.
Finger Search
The confession received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar González at a press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant for the Dictoscoscopier specialist of Sijin from Cali.
Many people don't know our job.
Dactiloscopy is a science of strict science, and it can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, Dactiloscopy specialists participate in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and identify detainees.
Many criminals have forged or do not have a document when they are detained.
We take their prints and we find them in the base.
The researcher said that in the event of theft, he had to carry a piece of the wall of the house because in this place the thief was fighting his hands to acquire a safe full of jewels and money.
"With walls it's hard to work because they're not convenient surfaces to take prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole palm and identify the criminal who's been involved in several thefts," he says.
Prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man with liquor bottles around him was recently found.
The investigation found that a relative could have been suspected of having committed the crime and that the fingerprints on the bottle had indeed coincided.
Although it does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was on the scene.
A CTI Dactiloscopy specialist explained that chemical or physical reagents are applied to locations with prints.
When they are displayed, a blade or tape is used to remove them.
The fingerprints are then sent to Asif, which is the database of the perpetrators, or are entered into the register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI television program.
Just like gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves a fingerprint on it.
However, if possible, the comparison is made.
The angry people are challenging the New York authorities.
Hundreds of protesters were camped in front of the Zuccotti Square.
Some of the protesters heard the court's decision to clear the square and went to the park next door.
The members of the Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to re-invasion under the protection of a court order into Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn while attempting to seize another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protestors had disappeared in the Zukotti Square, where they wanted to go by means of a court order that allowed the “wrathed people” to camp in the square until another part of the movement responded to the raid by seizing a park in the north of the city where further arrests had taken place.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will break camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the “wrong people” to the evacuation of the tent town ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, had been brought before a court where Judge Lucy Billings had issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the “wrathy people” began to seize a new park located at the merger of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the parish of the Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they were able to occupy this place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not say the exact number, but he said that he had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures us that several hundred people were standing with tents where the delegation of religious leaders had gone to demonstrate support for members of the movement by trying to mediate with the police.
However, the Zukotti area, which is a private property, remains closed pending the trial scheduled for that Tuesday, which will examine the legality of this morning ' s campaign of protesters.
Some of the protesters who went there carried and distributed at the same time copies of that court order and even provided copies of them to the police protecting the area, which led to “some small clashes”, said Bray, who stated that some policemen had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Wall Street movement and forcing them to enforce “laws that were issued after the seizure began or prohibiting demonstrators from returning to the park with shops and other property previously used”.
Mayor Bloomberg told the reporters that because of this court order the city had suspended public space and the demonstrators had been informed of it, but local laws prevented them from re-opening tent shops and sleeping bags.
A municipal councillor had personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation during which some 200 arrests had been made, and a decision had been taken because the protesters “had violated the law”.
Bloomberg said he had ordered that the area be cleared because it became “a place where people came not to protest but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others”, because “some businesses have been threatened” and neighbors feared “for the deterioration of the quality of life”.
This morning's evacuation was repugnant and shows that deep down in Bloomberg's soul there is a greater interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers," added a representative of the movement who condemns the mayor's "regard for freedom of expression."
In addition, those responsible for "Build Wall Street" indicated that they were planning to organize "grand actions" on Thursday, in collaboration with social organizations and trade unions, to recall the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Bouble and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the television program Russell Peters' Christmas on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "The Big Renovation," a survivor in the "Malbu Saviours", Banny in "Pleiboa", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the raven (a ballad performer), Michael Boublet and other prominent Canadians, would appear on "Russia Peters' Christmas" on December 1, as a very special Mary.
CTV presented a television show today, in which Anderson, also known on the Internet for his widely distributed pornographic video, appears with her husband, the drummer of the Mötley Crue, Tommy Lee, dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comic book of Indian origin who recently took the lead on "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Shin, appears as Joseph.
In the apparition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian song singer, who married in Buenos Aires in late March to the Argentine model of Lucian Lopilato, is also familiar with scandals.
Recently, Buble called American woman Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan, reborn after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and ended the fall, which began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that has resulted from the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster experienced by the Land of the rising sun since World War II.
The first estimate by the Tokyo Government was $300,000 — a blow that appears to be taking place despite the difficult world situation.
After three lost quarters in a row, gross domestic product data between July and September clearly helped to turn the page around: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent over the previous quarter and by 6 per cent annually.
Registered in the second quarter - the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rate between January and March 2010.
The return may be due in part to the revival of the purchase of machine equipment for the reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami that followed.
Indeed, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, against a 0.9 per cent decrease in capital costs, which was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real fracture in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenesian momentum, which calls for the use of the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan has been awakened mainly by the growth of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This figure has increased by 1 per cent with increased costs of cars, travel and rest.
Yen glue
Tokyo provided the domestic market when yen, Japanese currency, became one of the “refuges” selected by investors who want to escape the euro debt crisis and negative US forecasts, a privilege that puts a stone on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic rate is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for its low rates from July to September.
As the markets continue to be subject to the siege of the EU ' s offshore countries, the Government of Esikhico Noda does not reduce vigilance.
We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, said Motohisa Furukawa, Minister of Economic Policy yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had demonstrated clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts fractures in the world economy, has shown that major forces are slowing down.
It then fell on four tenths to 100.4 points, compared with 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone has even fallen below the average of 100 points after it hit 8 tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Again Gives the Ground for Debate
Papimos said that the adjustment would be approved, but conservatives would not sign any written obligation
With the peripheral prizes for risk and uncertainty that reigned in the parks, Greece continues to wander through the maze that leads to a major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consent” of the new Transitional Government of Ella is imposed by Brussels rather than by the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papapimos warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one-hundred-and-a-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient for their application, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the conservative party “New Democracy”, assured that he would not support the new strict-saving measures in any case and reiterated his demand for the new elections appointed on 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to follow up on the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, said Papapimos yesterday, opening the parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the confidence of the new executive branch.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
But the message of Samaras does not clarify his position: “We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing.”
The Conservative Leader took one step more step in his moods about the EU and the IMF, the organizations that should unfrozen the 8,000 million urgently needed by Athens, and explained that he would not endorse any letter of consent to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still being irritated by the effect of the Paandreu referendum allegations in style, reiterated yesterday that its demands were clear: it would not resume assistance unless the new Greek Government and the leaders of the major parties signed “a written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible”.
A representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafai, said that the troika inspectors could “very soon” return to Athens to discuss with the new Government “what has to be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been fixed.
There's plenty of threads in the Greek glomerulus for a while.
Ms. Sofia: “These are tools of progress and hope”
The Queen stressed the “core” place of Spain with regard to this type of finance
Spain has “became prominent in the world in the area of microfinance”.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country had become the second-largest donor in terms of cooperation instruments whose “substance”, she said, was “a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on faith in men”.
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “perfectly necessary” to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “especially with a view to reducing by half the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is fixed”.
Spain is still working to expand the network of recipients around the world and is taking on this challenge with “responsibility”, says daughter Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women, the principal recipients of these loans”.
There's "a lot of achievement" and "a lot of difficulty we're facing."
The Microcredit Summit is becoming not only a space for disputes, but also a platform that promotes “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and that one hundred million of those households would be able to escape from the poverty into which they were caught.
The momentum towards the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world “went on the road that began years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, underlined by Ms. Sofia as “the act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as "a striking idealist in the global fight against poverty," whose work has been known for 15 years since the queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy locally.
This experience took place a year later at the first Washington World Summit and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “where I saw continuous development”, said Her Majesty, whose association with this project brought her the title “family heads” gathered in Valladolid as a “poor banker”.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and finding solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
“Ethical imperative”
The Foreign Minister of Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity is an “ethical imperative” for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as it was a “permanent commitment”.
Jiménez concluded that microcredit involves a “serious and firm approach to poverty eradication”, and now “more than ever” Governments of developed countries should work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of cost reduction.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soreia Rodrigues, commended the “success” of giving “confidential confidence” to people who were “disclosed and all doors closed to” and the mayor of Valladolid Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city, who “opened their doors in a spirit of solidarity”.
The CDC proposes to elect the Chairman of the European Commission by universal vote
On Monday, 14 November, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CSU) in Leipzig was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who also chairs the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but arose in the fall itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is far from as strict as it should be today towards Greece and perhaps tomorrow towards Italy....
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, introduced by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The evacuations, which lasted for several minutes and which deserved to be addressed by Angel Merkel and, a few hours later, by Wolfgang Schöyble, Europhile and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct response to the crisis is “no less than Europe, but more Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the chancellor, "it's time for a breakthrough in Europe."
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty, which would make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control over the financial policies of the countries of the Eurozone, but it could also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by universal vote “to make Europe face”.
In any case, this is one of the proposals for a draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which is apparently the one of Wolfgang Schöyble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree with this decision; Britain is opposed, and the leaders of the CDC believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is against it.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the voice of each EU member country on the European Central Bank board according to the size of the economy of each country, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wishing to calm the situation in her party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Koli, but she did not seek to influence the Congress at the expense of the “small” European countries or countries in distress who like to criticize “high” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe highlighted the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angel Merkel did not mention France.
Just by passing.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating attacks by the Napoleon army.
What is hospital letter fraud?
Following the cash benefits, UPP and the Government began to attack the hospital records.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the family benefit fund and speak on this issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on combating social benefits fraud.
And in order to help this advance, which arose out of a desire to save lives in a difficult situation but also as part of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority want to focus on sick leaves.
Firstly, in view of the budget savings, the Government intended to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on employees of private companies prior to payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the specific consent of the employer, the sick worker will lose his salary in four days, equal to a minimum of 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to give rise to a storm of anger but that, according to Les Echo, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose one day on public servants without a sickness benefit (the public servants have not yet had to wait for payment of the benefit, unlike the three-day waiting period for private sector employees).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority are also raising the issue of fraud again, with a view to abuse of hospital records.
Control will be tougher and in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all payments you receive illegally," warned Xavier Bertrand on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the application has been somewhat disproportionate to actual abuse of hospital leaves.
They have indeed been subjected to continuous monitoring and political attacks since 2002, which bear fruit.
People in France are no more suffering than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's take a look at the country figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensation costs of Euro11,300 million in 2008 accounted for 5% of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were for maternity leave and occupational accidents and 54 per cent for sickness benefits, which amounted to Euro6.2 million.
And therefore, 2.5 per cent of health-related costs.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in the hospital in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consultation Group.
The average, which conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site, showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken any day to hospital.
Another study, which deals with health insurance this time, states that in 2010 37 per cent of hospitalizations lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent of 15 days until one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent longer.
A comparison of these figures with those of European neighbours shows that French workers are no more likely to be sick than those of any other country.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers revealed that between 1994 and 2001, the total unemployment rate in France (for reasons of health or not) varied between 10% and 11%, compared with 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of hospital-related fraud is very low compared to “serene” employment.
On the level of fraud, it's very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has resulted in systematic check-up of hospital staff for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term reports were “unjustifiable” or too long, or 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital records, 11 per cent of cases out of 1.2 million were “unsuitable or unfounded”, or 132,000.
In general, 169,000 cases were “unjustifiable” for several million hospital workers.
Figures that show very few cases compared with, for example, grey employment.
According to Employer Dominique Tiana, author of the June report on the subject, they amount to between Euro9 million and Euro15,000 million a year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation and is therefore infinitely higher than the losses of fraud.
Papimos: Greece should follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papapimos stated this, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition Government were not sufficient to carry out this task.
“In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme”, said the head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening up the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be “the main task” of the new Government, since the country's presence in Eurozone was “at stake”, he added.
Accordingly, Papidios predicts a decline in the country's fiscal deficit “up to 9 per cent” of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Right-wing parties reject the measures of the new Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional strict savings.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the deputies of his party, the New Democracy.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but also his opposition to any course that impeded economic recovery.
Ollie Renu, European Commissioner for Economy and Finance, who warned that IMF and EU would not release the necessary credit of Euro8,000 million without written guarantees from all the parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign under external pressure.
Euthanasia and suicide must be legalized with outside assistance, as stated by the Committee of Experts
Canadians are refused to die, as confirmed in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, and this does not include cases of cancer.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9 percent of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which brought together six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee suggests that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow suicide with outside assistance and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Office, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in its 10th place, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to argue on the subject of death”.
Whether or not medical treatment is available, but 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them die in hospital.
The country ' s highest rate is in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide, the report concludes that it is contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the Penal Code with regard to euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse, i.e. euthanasia or suicide with outside assistance, of people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during the teleconference, most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Foreign suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 percent of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia because, according to Angus Reid ' s 2010 survey, they believe this will allow people to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not be a signal that the life of older persons or persons with disabilities is of lesser value.
In the case of those who assisted with suicide, 41 per cent of those interviewed believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care, the situation was less clear, the authors of the report said.
They also suggest, among other recommendations, that the Penal Code establish that the lawful termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for end-of-life health care without fear of criminal prosecution.
Regarding palliative care, the Committee encourages the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Lastly, with regard to the palliative or terminal seat already widely used in Canadian health-care institutions, the Committee required that it should be applied where it did not serve to dull the physical pain like euthanasia and subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some health-related experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Meter Pierre Deschán, a health law specialist, described the “extreme” position of the experts who signed the report as, among other things, not limiting the use of euthanasia to fatal cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age can ask for help to commit suicide, says Met. Deschán, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Meter Descham also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the independence of the individual above all other values that formed the social fabric of society.
He said that “there are warning signs and prohibitions in society”.
A health law specialist, Margaret Somerville, also expresses “categorical opposition to the findings of the report, which she described as “a manifesto for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who himself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, challenges, inter alia, the report on abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide have been legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls upon President Assad to give up power
Damascus condemns “conspiracy”
Syria’s Exclusion
Bashar Assad's supporters held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure increased against Syria Bashar Assad, who, with the support of Russia, opposes him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syrian membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syrian neighbours Turkey and Jordan have opted for President Assad ' s resignation.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar Assad to give up power in Syria, where some forty more civilians and members of the regime's armed forces were killed.
“If Bashar had the expensive interests of his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life,” said the King of Jordan, a neighbouring country to Syria, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who did not live in peace with their people and who could not satisfy their aspirations would lose power, he said, implying that Syria was a neighbouring country against which Turkey was taking an increasingly rigid course.
For its part, the United States welcomes “the expansion of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime”, following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly stringent course towards reprisals in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department.
During this period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the armed forces of the regime were killed in the Der`a area in southern Syria, reporting to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and shooting of heavy machine guns in Jobara in the besieged town of Homs, according to the ONG.
During a press conference, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem of Syria stated that the country was nearing the end of the crisis.”
Furthermore, he had responded sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to remove Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, but he has added that the plot against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires the engagement of 500 members of the Arab Organization for Human Rights, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Giuppe also spoke in favour of sending observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime he said had fallen into the “paranoia”.
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of armed forces from fighting cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, yesterday called the decision of the League of Arab States “uncorrective”, while China called on Syria to implement its plan to address the crisis but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty needs time from the markets and the victims of the Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monty, requested some time from the markets to form a team and execute a programme that would require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi rule.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties prior to today ' s meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively modest cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a multi-victim programme, said Francesco Nukara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the discussions after meeting with the candidate for the post of Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he would have waited to find out if Mario Monti would have the Parliament vote up to Friday to make sure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with Mr. Monty ' s submission of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of the country, George Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervousness of stock exchanges and bond holders, asking for time.
With “democracy, it takes time to prepare a Government and a programme, he stressed, adding that he was confident that markets would be patient and understanding.”
His appointment as President was initially approved by the markets, but concerns were raised again, particularly after the sudden fall of industrial production in Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister was to form a team of technocrats, which included, most importantly, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politics”.
The new Government would have to operate until 2013, the dates of the next election, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Djanfranco Fini, the new Government will receive a vote of confidence from Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that he would work harder to guarantee that Italy would become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of the European Commissioner, Ollie Ren, stressed that “in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not implement the 2013 budget, despite the strict savings plan adopted in recent months, had called for new strict measures in particular.
The Italian boss Emma Marcheglia, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that has no growth cannot comply with the deficit”.
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence in life by the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented “a change of era” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, “a professor” symbolizing “a challenge of seriousness” and “other Italy”, according to the authors.
The great unknown is the permanence of his team.
President Napolitano would be pleased to avoid early elections, since by April 2012, Italy was expected to make payments of 200,000 million euros in public debt.
A Russian scientist helped with the Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danielenko helped Iran to develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, confirmed on Monday the United States Agency for Nuclear Dangers.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations agency in order to identify the scientist.
During the past week, IAEA expressed concern about the “might military aspect” of Iran's nuclear programme
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years “from the sixtieths onwards at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds of explosive methods”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to set up a company producing nano-alms in Kiev.
His company ' s financial difficulties had led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, until he returned to Russia.
In its report, IAEA refers to “the apparent signs that Iran's development” of a nuclear detonator system has “helped the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the equipment well but who has also informed the Agency that he has worked most of his career on the technology within the framework of his country's military nuclear programme”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday 2009-2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by nearly 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence decreased slightly or remained unchanged during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, compared to a 13 per cent increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in attacks against Jews and a 14 per cent increase in the total number of religiously motivated crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very little to 6,628, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
Following the decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is increasing again, and emphasizes the Human Rights First, “an increase in the incidence of violence against Muslims” in the official communication.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as serious human rights violations”, added Paul Lejandr, director of the organization.
“The American Government can and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this could be done by improving police reports of hate crimes.”
“Hate crimes” in federal law are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was enacted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and the sexual orientation of our day.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes Facebook-like
On Monday, Twitter's microblog site changed the presentation of its platform to allow its users to see, in particular, the activity of those they're monitoring, which makes this service look like Facebook.
The new Activity tab and other "names" allow you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other Twitter users, Internet users whose messages ("whistles") you are tracking and those who are tracking yours.
This allows them to know if they publish messages, if they sign up for new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested by "a small percentage of users in August" before being made widely available online on Monday, and AFP told the Twitter press secretor Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, known for a long time as intuitively somewhat unclear and using rather vague terms (RT for someone else's connection, #flowfy for the recommendation to track other users), is basically a pleasure to experienced users, thus opening itself up to a wider audience by presenting users something closer to popular Facebook and Google+ social networks.
Online users discussed this innovation with Twitter on the Internet.
"It's useless, obsessive, and too much like Facebook."
Functional activity will help me to better track certain elements of my Twitter stream by writing @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the constitution of the “golden rule” of the budget
The leadership of the large coalition of social democracies and Christian democracies in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the budget “golden rule” into the Constitution in order to reduce the fiscal deficit and thus avoid possible reductions in Austria's public credit rating by rating agencies (troika A).
The chancellor of the Social Democratic Verner Fimann personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with Austria ' s public debt of 74.6 per cent, which is considerably higher than the 60 per cent ceiling established by the Maastricht Treaty, but lower than the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay fell on only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by 3,000 million euros more every year, and the Vice-Canter and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Christian Democracies Michael Spindelegger gave an argument.
Austria is therefore meeting the requirement of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; the heads of State and Government demanded a reduction in fiscal deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The Austrian Government's decision reminds us of the “German model”, since Germany was the first European country to adopt that “rule”.
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) every year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the federal State's State's budget should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP in any year, and land, like communes, should provide balanced budgets.
The aim is to force the public debt to fall below the 60 per cent mark of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2011.
Essychiko Noda
threatens new intervention on the currency market
The Prime Minister of Japan, Esikhiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new interventions on the currency market if the price of the yen continued to rise.
We intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the yen exchange rate, as explained by Mr. Noda Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen grew to almost historic marks, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold a large dollar yen to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had established a new force record since 1945.
But since then the yen has been growing constantly, driven by the purchase of investors, who see it as a “refuge” in these sad times of economic collapse around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level of the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis, the dollar cost about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
Japanese currency growth is detrimental to Japanese exports as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converting to national currency.
“Japan fights to rebuild itself” after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who feared that the growth of the yen would kill the fragile embryo of the recovery.
The third largest economic power in the world resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent as compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year - thanks to increased exports and consumption of disaster-affected households
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect “Japan's fundamental economic performance”.
Finance Minister Jun Azzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Manager, Hirohid Yamaguti, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps” to realize that no further mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the issuing organization increased by 5,000 million yen (Euro47,000 million) to the purchase of treasury bonds, raising to 55,000 million yen (Euro519,000 million) the ceiling that it has allocated to the purchase of various financial instruments to fill the stock market.
Eurozone
Rates grow, stock exchanges fluctuate
The risk of contracting the debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of State in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, the rates in fragile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left for this Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and completed the bidding at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4 percent and London by 0.1 percent.
Owing to the new difficulties in paying credit to the eurozone countries in difficult situations, stock markets around the world continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
"Axious investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, the institutional broker of IG Markets quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo Exchange closed down by 0.7 per cent under new market doubts about Europe ' s ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has sought to look at Europe, and the exchanges will follow one another in the narrow corridor until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsucigue Akino, fund manager at Ichioshi Investment Management
This return of concern over the future of the eurozone is a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its bottom point in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., European currency was worth $1.3570, falling by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, it fell after the concertation of the Chancellor's Party, Angela Merkel CDC, on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, inter alia, an opportunity for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at an alarming level.
On Tuesday morning, Italian ten-year bond returns reached 6.85 per cent, and Spanish bond returns reached 6.2 per cent with the same maturity.
These difficulties, with interest rates in the southern countries but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monty, requested time from the exchanges to restore the situation in Italy, which was threatened by paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papapimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be “the main task” of his Government.
Spain was targeted by markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The divide between interest rates on 10-year debt by Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Waiting for Eurozone growth figures
France recorded economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent due to increased household consumption.
Inse, however, revised downwards in the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about quarter four.
Germany, in turn, recorded a 0.5 per cent increase over the same period.
The first assessment of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be decided upon after brief discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is energy policy.
Accessibility and the cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are an occasion for reflection on the fate and place occupied by nuclear energy.
Controversy will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental impacts of the proposed options are examined.
France must base its views on objective facts and rational data.
Now we are 7,000 million people on the planet, population development will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to generate electricity continuously, bearing in mind the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to address the climate imbalance, a theme that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which places its decision on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, China, the Czech Republic, Finland, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, India, Brazil are few of those who are committed to continuing their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one installation to its kit, re-establishing the construction of the station, which was interrupted following the Tri-May Island accident.
Although the German renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
Berlin's choice would result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, for carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
Within a few months, all these adverse effects will already be felt.
We should consider Denmark’s example.
The European turbine champion, from which she receives 30 per cent of her electricity, is also the largest coal and gas consumer due to the interrupted wind; hence, carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than in Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40 percent more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy, the price of energy is a key factor in the competitiveness and maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a consequence, any significant reduction in nuclear power will result in a significant increase in the cost of electricity, which will make beautiful statements of our country ' s new industrialization and of the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay is especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole set of internationally specialized small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved into another industry.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of those facilities and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electric engineer would order an EPR designed to work for sixty years if its manufacturer was scheduled to be closed down?
To determine the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or Satanic sources of energy production.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions is evidence of the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of safety is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security agency that controls existing energy centres, such as Flamanville, without compromise and transparency.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are filled with the same complacency of security.
The atomic industry has survived three major incidents for 50 years.
Only one, Tri-May Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental impact.
In Chernobyl, a reactor device and an inexcusable human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented power that caused tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from the accident, as it learned from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between security agencies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, presents a project to counter such phenomena.
As it is viewed by all energy professionals wishing to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to the competitors Areva and EDF, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of atomic energy.
There must be a legitimate search for the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to our country ' s economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration - the burden or the good for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized on various sides: the overload of police, judicial and administrative services, the subordinates of the policy of figures, and the compatibility of the policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a “State of human rights”.
Then came the administrative harassment of foreign students when the Minister of the Interior (Liberación of 23 May) stated that France “does not need foreign talents, stoners and waiters”.
But it is rarely analysed economically.
The right and left agree to a great deal.
On the right side, Jacques Chirac stated in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed people will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers”, and on the left side, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “could not accept the poor from all over the world”.
Differences only in the level of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right felt threatened by the invasion of the country by the Polish plumber.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they will grant to immigrants.
In his programme, François Allland confined himself to banalism, saying that “joint work would solve our immigration problem”.
This perception of immigration as a burden and a problem may have an electoral advantage, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book on immigration (Special People: how migration has shaped our world and will determine our future, May 2011, Princeton University publication, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among professionals about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restriction of immigration has weakened growth and reduced employment.
Fear of immigrant influence is based on the assumption that they can replace local workers, especially low-skilled workers, with lower wages.
But experience has shown that, in reality, immigrants are far more complementary than replacing local labour by performing jobs that lack local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors which do not attract local labour and the most skilled are in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity existing between local and immigrants has had a positive effect on the salaries of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1 per cent increase in the migration flow resulted in an increase of 0.6-0.9 per cent in real long-term wages.
This does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (among the American Nobel laureates a large proportion of naturalized immigrants and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make net gains in social security systems, giving an average of 1 per cent of European total budgets.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 in Germany will produce a net return on an average of Euro150,000 in the State budget for his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy was about to get caught up in the missing growth.
These teeth, which were used to deter immigrants, have had a exactly opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to understand European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, by inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the twentieth century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, the totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, and Franco in Spain, the Salazar in Portugal and the Colonels in Greece.
Some felt that it was sufficient for democracy to finally prevail over its enemies to vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's time, Little One knows that this is from the surface of the thinking.
The universal vote, although a prerequisite for democracy, is not sufficient and can even be a “tool of oppression”, as Etienne Vulro, a Republican philosopher, once said.
No, democracy requires much more — public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis that we are experiencing is the economic crisis, but above all it is the political crisis and the crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palliodium of the true-true Greek referendum will have a double revealing effect, showing both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasant sense of its impossibility and inconsistency.
That duality must be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved and many feel that Republican soldiers are now targeting the wrong direction.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart Blanche" for an absolute European monarch, or a foot-and-foot jump in the abyss of nationalism -- what a choice for a citizen!
No, we dream not of the blade of guillotine, but of implementation — shared, clear and continuous — of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Spain, and we don't know how many more, because there's only one crisis, the European crisis.
Europe as a whole is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, and suffers from weakness and lack of solidarity.
Europe is totally humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of the sovereignty of Europe, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
There was an urgent need to restore the management of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because only Europeans can work together to reduce the debt burden of everyone, to break free from markets and to prepare for the future by investing in it.
Breaking the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to disaster.
After much discussion of this proposal by the socialists and Jacques Delor, everyone now demands a European economic government.
Let's do it.
But to imagine it without stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has come into existence, is another madness and a new impasse.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” Republicans.
The revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a united Europe at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine people ' s European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's make Europeans.
Contact-free cards are spreading more and more.
The World Map Exhibit opens on Tuesday in Wilpinte, Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with an 11% increase in world sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards), exceeding 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important sector is the touchless technology sector, which makes it possible to pay for public transport or purchases by simply mapping the reading device.
This year, 460 million touchless chips will be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) to almost 10% of the world card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which had lagged behind the Asian and Pacific region for a long time, was moving forward in the area of interest-free payments.
About 26 million Visa's bank cards are already equipped with this function and are receiving 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest position, with 40,000 Visa-free maps.
But big shops are increasing their pace.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million touchless Pass MasterCard.
To move to higher speeds, banks must provide equipment for their clients.
“Two large organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute to their clients bank cards for non-continuous use in the future,” said Gérard Nebuy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments by mobile phone.
But this is only the first step in developing a future means of payment, i.e. mobile phone.
So far, only a few machines are equipped with the NFC technology (passing field communication) necessary for such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they should really fly next year."
"We are counting on world sales of 80 million to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, chapter Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday Crédit Agricole announced the experiment from December to June of next year in Cana.
The iPhone equipment of approximately 200 clients and staff will be provided with free-of- touch boards.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal to allow his clients to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing relationship between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram has been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that the Algerians were now confident.
“The way these two organizations use and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained without going into detail.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
An investigation into the abduction of two French people in the Niger in January revealed two links.
The persons abducted at the Niamey restaurant were apparently killed the next day by persons close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leokura and Vincent Delori, together with several of the kidnappers during an operation conducted by the French special forces.
Among the wreckages left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone sym-maps belonging to terrorists.
Here's Terror.
An analysis of the calls was made by several interlocutors who were present in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who lived long in Majdiguri, a town in northern Nigeria, a cradle Boco Haram and the other is said to be close to Aqmi and a sect.
“This is a step forward, but there is no doubt that we need to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect receives financial and ideal support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in Boco Haram ' s actions and statements and methods, which now include the use of suicides and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, D.C., is now exerting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the challenges that Boko Haram poses.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people who are not interested.
Quick success
Founded in Maidiguri in 2002, at the mosque, school and imam fundamentalist Mohammed Yousuf, Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin", preachs the establishment of an Islamic emerate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In that poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It is politicized and demands strict observance of the Sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central government.
It focuses on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boco Haram activists were particularly active in numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, is incoherent.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yousuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and going beyond its northern walls.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Jos and then for another in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram launched the first suicide attack on a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the United Nations field presence would be their first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which flows from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now of concern to all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi has been strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from Al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with Presidents Goodlac Jonathan Alain Giuppe warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
The world, as seen by Republican presidential candidates
In the case of China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and incompetence.
Can a crisis - stricken America bring about a complex world with simple, and more precise, simplifying ideas?
If you heard the Republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying loud, but lacking details on foreign policy, which are traditionally a strong party to the Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and assistance to Israel are often mixed.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of bringing the Old Good Party, threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese in the WTO and to accuse them of “manipulatives of their currency is a sensitive subject for America, an irritated migration of entire industries into Asia.
Worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama of China, and the only candidate in difficult foreign policy, was unable to overcome an emotional attitude.
He called for a solid but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama ' s position).
But Huntsman, who's holding on to the bottom of the ratings, was left unheard of.
Reagan-style
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If I am chosen, I will stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of failing to fulfil promises made to that partner.
Herman Kane's business, second in the candidate rating, has shown a discouraging lack of awareness.
He had recently called for resistance to the Chinese military threat, because Beijing was trying to achieve nuclear power — evidently without knowing that China had already possessed it since 1964!
The governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes against Iran, says that he is willing to use the United States army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The terrorist suspects prohibited by Obama in 2009 are also recommended by Kane, Perry and the candidate Michel Bahman.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCaine, the heavy weight of foreign policy.
Opposers of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to reduce his tone with regard to the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of “children” from Iraq, and on his schemes in Libya, which have brought him a reputation for weak politics.
But it's not that easy.
The population considers the balance of national security with Obama, which has eliminated Ben Ladena.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are tied in the sand.
And arguing that America must be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
North Stream, new gate for Russian gas entry into Europe.
The North Trend, linking Western Europe and Russia directly to the Baltic Sea floor, has been launched.
It is designed to provide 30 million households with gas equivalent.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pomp.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic coasts, between the orchestra and the found snacks, at the opening of the North Flow, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
The chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fiyon and his Dutch colleague, Mart Reutte, brought back together a symbolic valve controlling Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
Under the new gas pipeline, 27,500 million additional cubic metres of gas will flow to Western Europe each year on the first 1,224 km long pipeline linking Leningrad region with Meklenburg-Mere land.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The draft met with fierce opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream would indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Stream with the new German-Soviet Pact, which implied an alliance between Hitler and Stalin in order to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means that the issue is politically sensitive.
In support of this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But at the cost of losing European energy, because the project created a gap between eastern and western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has achieved its understanding of the direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already in the process of completing.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, this is a new artery that binds us in an organic way," said François Fiion, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All of this explains the extensive smiles on the heads of Gazprom who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas destination.
The construction of this gas pipeline is a technical feat.
The submarine is made of concrete steel to protect it from anchor ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
In order to build it, minefields that had remained since the Second World War had to be bypassed.
"The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, press secretary for North Trek.
Many steps had also to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, free from interruptions throughout its length, no valves, and no service stations.
The control platform was planned in the Swedish area but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not pleased that the Russian state company would live forever off its coast.
"In the event of an accident, we'll cut off the gas flow in less than a minute," Jans Müller claims.
So if the gas in the gas pipeline is leaked, it's going to go into the air.
But this seems to be unlikely designers who designed seams designed only once every 100,000 years.
The status of the gas pipeline will be monitored by an underwater robot pulling the vessel for external observation, as well as by a machine operating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigarette-shaped apparatus is inserted inside the pipe with a diameter of 1 m and pushed forward by a gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it provides accurate information on any distortion of the metal.
The gas pipeline has been designed for 50 years without the need for minor repairs.
The gas shall be recycled only at the expense of its pressure.
It is 200 bars of departure and 100 bars of arrival.
Five companies joined forces to carry out the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who owns 51% of capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suz (9 per cent each).
The five companies established a joint venture called the North Stream, which was tasked with building and operating a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters is located in Tsuga in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased this company for 20 years, with the possibility of extending the full volume of gas transportation.
“The gas will pay for the full amount, no matter how much gas is actually being transported,” claims Jens Muller.
Funding for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30 per cent of shareholders and 70 per cent of bank loans.
The total cost of work would be Euro7,400 million for two pipelines.
GDF Suz will invest about 240 million.
But minor shareholders are confident that they will pay for their expenses because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline leaves the Baltic Sea in Ljubmina on a sandy beach lined with coniferous trees.
Ventils 4.5 meters high form the gas output terminal.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 it will be 6 million.
Moleskine brand notepad
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will return to the taste of writing.
He has the scent of adventures, the hours spent in writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notepad is easy to find out on a rectangular black cover, on a rubber sheet, on yellow and white pages, like yellow over time.
However, Moleskine’s notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to sell design notes.
Maria Sepregondi, then consultant to the company, took responsibility for launching the new product.
The notepad is inspired by an old production technique, a mollusk, a latched cotton cloth used, for example, to cover benches.
This type of notepad is said to be highly valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskin brought up today's taste of an old and forgotten thing that was a cult for avanguardian artist until the 20th century," told Maria Sepregondi, who has since become the managing brand of Modo Modo Modo.
Good luck.
From 2006 to 2010, sales grew by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We were far from producing the first few years when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's hard to identify a typical buyer because the notepad is equally attracted by a businessman, a student and a man of a free profession.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, widely regarded and educated.
A small Italian company, originally with only 12 employees, now has 100 offices and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks at Fnac bookstores, shops in small city centers, and has become widely known.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need in the letter despite the arrival of e-mail," explains Maria Sepregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; recently, the brand organized an exhibition entitled “The Circuit Road”, where architects and artists demonstrated their own notes.
In August, he also launched leopard covers on the occasion of a film festival in Locarno.
Using his successes and cultural aura, Moleskine has developed his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and brand includes all kinds of support.
A success that led to jealousy: In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, now Syntegra Capital, which has written a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate among workers with disabilities so high?
About 19 per cent of disabled persons seek employment.
The 15th Week of Employment of Persons with Disabilities begins today.
Despite the policy of public charity initiated in 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities is still double the average, i.e. 19 per cent as against 9 per cent for the general population.
Can't you be kidding me?
“No,” says Eric Blanche, Director General of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for persons with disabilities.”
“A considerable amount of progress has been made over the 15 years.”
"At that time the unemployment rate was not 2 but 3 times higher."
"However, there's still a lot of work to be done."
It must be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for a disabled person.
Of these, 37 per cent are over 50 years of age (17 per cent on average).
They are more likely to have low qualifications: 80 per cent have no baccalaureate, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, accounting for 85 per cent of disabled persons compared to 38 per cent on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to get back to work and which are the core of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about the mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
A study commissioned by Cité by the IMS-Entreprendre in April revealed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability and had “represented the whole people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally incomplete”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from having 6 per cent of workers with disabilities as stipulated in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
“Today we're about 3%,” says Pierre Blance, director general of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “taxed” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, declined from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from 606 million euros to Euro480 million).
"The 2005 Act, which raised the tax, put strong pressure on the company," explains Pierre Blance.
“But this improvement also reflects increased awareness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What happiness."
Eden Azar and Georges Lakeens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match before fighting the Blues on Tuesday evening (20.45).
We're not going to get to the point that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the painting is symbolic.
sitting next to the arena of Stade de France, Georges Lakeens and Eden Azar made peace.
Five months after his attacker was released in a match against Turkey, a Belgian coach could only commend him.
"I am very pleased with Eden and his promotion and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go on," Lille's player says.
The contrast between his achievements in the club and those in the assembly is one whole, and he is justified.
"I'm in Lille year round, and Belgium isn't."
"I have to earn glasses."
Left behind, in anticipation of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to St. Deni to finally “bright”.
Not to be overlooked, however, is the notion of “satisfaction”.
He has supported the Blue since the age of 7 and the victory campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special nature of the match.
And especially that which is on the other side is Matya, Johan and Adil,' he remembers.
"It's just our roads crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness."
Lexens kindly remembered pride.
"Glory" playing "glorious match."
"Glory" is also to claim as a "neighbor" that France "rather became a very high-level team" just one year after a trauma in Naysne.
"Loran Blance was like a thunderbolt, admired by him.
Now that Belgium has missed the next Euro, the technical athlete will be on the same plane as the blue man... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
"We build something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll see it in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident of itself.
Portugal ' s response to Bosnia (22 a.m.) is beginning on this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"By the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paula Bent is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt in his mind that the Collection, which he has run since September 2010, is in Europe 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes happy.
But there's a match to play, and a Bosnian match to be won.
In view of the 0-0 on Friday, it is clear in Hell that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it has failed to achieve the willful goal of calming it.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk."
But in their brightly lit stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass before the eyes of the public, who must be thrilled, even though the match will be very tense," said optimistic but prudent Bento.
"We're waiting for a very tense match, but we're sure we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of getting to Euro 2012," said Carlos Keiros' successor.
Nothing on Friday in the match against Bosnia demands that the Portuguese win.
Nobody could make Bosniaks.
"This is a good result, which has, however, some risk," lamented Benta.
"We're going to play against a team that's got a lot of technical merit and a lot of individual virtues from the players," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "not give them time to think."
A good idea, if only this time it would be realistic.
