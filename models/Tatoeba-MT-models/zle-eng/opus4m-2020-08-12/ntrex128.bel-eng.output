Great extra deputations are concerned about what look like wrinkles.
Some deputators don't understand why their deputation should change to "member of the Parliament of Wales."
The officials came across with plans to change the name of the local east to "Parliament Wales".
The officials of all political views think that this is a bit of a deal.
One deputitalist said that his colleagues were worried about what it's mumbling with the words "stupid" and "feeling".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "stupid", and pwp means "stupid".
Deputat said her group was completely unsatisfied and offered alternatives.
The Valian conservatives said that their group was ready to discuss changing the name of the congregation, but they said that it was a short word shift from a member of the Valian parliament to "marine."
In this context, the gross letter w is put into the same as the Yorkshire English pronunciation.
The Assembly's Commission, which is now drafting a draft law on making changes to the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the deputites of the meetings are calling, of course, the question of the members themselves."
The Wells Act of 2017 gives the Valiant East a right to change its own name.
In June the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals that showed broad support for the name of the parliament of Wales.
And in the case of the supplemental deputation title, the Commission preferred members of the Wells Parliament or the CNC, but the CP version received the most support in the course of public consultations.
Additional deputations are obviously offering alternate solutions, but the way to achieve consensus may become a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is supposed to submit a bill of change for a few weeks.
Reform reports will include other changes in the Assembly's work, such as rules on disqualifying extra deputations and changing the structure of the committee system.
The other deputators are making a final vote on what to call them when they are doing their mandated work.
Macedonia voice on a recommendation when you change the name of a country
On a Sunday, voters are asked to change the name of their country to "The Republic of North Macedonia" or to say so.
National vote was organized to solve a long-standing issue with the next Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens it was argued that the name of their north neighbour was a claim in their territory, which prevented Macedonia's involvement and friendship in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The president of Macedonia George Ivanov, who worked with the referendum on a change of name, said that he would not participate in the voting.
But followers of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zay, say that changing the name is just a price to pay for taking into the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The bells of St. Martin's Temple keep silent, The church at Harlem fights for existence
"Early, as the old people I spoke to spoke to were, at every corner there was a bar and a queen," said Mr. Adams.
"The sun is neither here nor there."
He said that the closing of the bars was understandable.
"People have different relationships and attitudes at present," he said.
"Bares are no longer the cozy local hotels where people walk permanent."
As to the church, he didn't worry that the money from the sale was active enough for as long as this expected leader, and sooner or later they'll come back to that where they started.
Churchs," he added, "can be replaced by residential houses with cottages filled with people who won't help temples stay in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of the people who buy Candamiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore it's an accelerated day when these churches shut up together, because it's unlikely that the more people who move to these Candaminums will become the affections of these churches."
Both churches were built by a solo of whites before Harlem became a black district-- The Church of Steel Grapes in 1870, the Church of Saint Martin in a decade later.
The original white Methodist that arrived in the 1930s.
The black cover which was praying near the street was allowed to form a building.
Saint Martin's Church was fascinated by a blacksmith led by Miss John Howard Jones, who headed for a fable of merchants in the main trader at Harlem 125th Street, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The fire in 1939 had left the building highly damaged, but the soldiers, under the leadership of the Father Johnson, had a reconstruction planned to re-establish it in the operation of the Rings.
closely like David Johnson, the son of the egg Johns and his prevailr at Saint Martin's Church, proud to call bullion "the called poor man."
The expert playing the ring in the tree called it another place, "Culture Treasure" and "An indeterminable historical tool."
An expert from the University of Michigan, Tiefani Ng, also said that it was the first in the world to be ringed by blacklisted musician Dinicio A. Linde, who 18 years ago moved to more than a kingdom in the German Church.
Mr. Mervester said that St. Martin's Church hadn't replaced him.
What happened in the Church of Saint Martin in the last few months was a complex story between architects and sub-prisoners, some of whom were attracted by unjust church leaders and others by the diocese.
The Verdor Epistress, which consists of chaplain's assistants, wrote in a diocese followed with caution that the diocese "try to transfer expenses" to the congregation of believers, although the congregation did not contribute to the employment of architects and sub-entrepreneurs, who were sent by the diocese.
Some fell back because of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old boy in a deep down to catch lobsters in California.
On Saturday the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting lobsters in California on the day he opened the season to catching lobsters.
The attack took place about seven o'clock in the morning at the Bacon Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that the morning did a diving with his friends for half an hour when he heard the boy scream, asking for help, and then swam with the others to help pull him out of the water.
At first, Hemel thought it was just an excitement from the catching of the lobsters, but then he "knowing something bad happened," and he said, "I'm a bit!
I'm bit!'
"All his key was broken," said Hemel, adding that he noticed this when he came to the boy.
I called everyone out of the water, "In the water near the shark!" he added.
The old boy was transported through the air to Reidy's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in a critical state.
And the diversity of the shark that launched this attack is unknown.
The rescue captain, Lara Giles, said it was for a bruffing of the media that the shark had been noticed here a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it's a safe variety.
Giles added that the casualties had got the May top of the body.
The causes have closed their approaches to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swazi in Esinitas for 48 hours in order to investigate and protect themselves.
Giles found that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsury's plan to move on to British beauty market
Sainsury's going to work with Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenhams, opening up divisions with beauty goods in the wagons where he's going to work as a trained specialist.
Within the framework of the great promotion to the British market for beauty by 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow, while the volume of the sale of fashion clothes and household goods is declining, the larger houses of beauty will be represented in 11 saloons throughout the country and also in other new saloons next year, which will demonstrate success.
beauty investments come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on shelves that had been busy TVs and micro-books and home goods.
Sainsbury's stated that it doubles the volume of beauty goods by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw which appear for the first time.
There'll be more room in these corporate offices than you can find in shops like Boots, for example.
The big shops also restart their Boutique casts, so that most products will be fit for vegans, and this trade becomes more and more required among young consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Soup perfume shop will be tested at two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened last week in Croydan in the south of London, and the second one will open in Seli Oak at the end of this year.
To buy from the Internet and go over to buy small amounts of products every day in local shops near the house means that supermarkets have to do more to get more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coone, the director of Sainsburg's, said that trading points would be more and more like the store, because the supermarket network is trying to compete with Aldi's floppy disks, Lidl using more services and non-native goods.
Sainsury's placed Argos' trading points in hundreds of shops, and placed several points of Habitats since two years ago acquired both networks, which he said contributed to the growth of food sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
Previous time, supermarkets to re-establish their department of beauty and pharmacism didn't end successfully.
Sainsury's protested a joint venture from Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to share revenue from optical shops ended after a series of proceedings at supermarkets.
The new strategy came into being three years after Sainsbury's sold its Apothetic Business together with 281 Selesio Apothetic Network Owner Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds.
It was stated that Lloyds had played a role in this regard by extending an assemblance of luxury brands to look after the skin, including La Roche-Pasey and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, a commercial director of Sainsbury's, said, "We've changed the look of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We've also invested in educating our employees to offer recommendations.
Our brandage is designed to suit any need, and our attractive posture and proper position make us the best home of beauty, counter to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones flexed after Halli Williamby gave up a deal of 11 million pounds sterling.
The standard Dragons Den Peter Jones split up after the television holly Willowby gave up a deal of 11 million pounds with his brand which specializes in the image of life, to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spence and ITV.
There's no time in Villab for branding goods for home and for Truly accessors.
The couple's business has become like the Gwynth of Goop's brand.
This morning a 37-year-old manager announced instagram that she was going off.
Holly Williamby left the star of Dragon's Den Peter Jones, who is now parting with his profitable business by creating brandy clothes, to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was killed when the girl's "golden" TV admitted at an intensive meeting held in Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlov (Buckinghamshire) that her new deal of up to 1.5 million pounds means that she would no longer have time to do home goods and brand brands for her.
The business was like the Guinette Pellet Goop brand and was doubled to double William's prosperity of 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old billowsby announced to Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the Great Britain and went to one of his houses of rest.
The source said: Truly was Holy's top priority.
This occurred to her in a long future, which she had seen after a couple of decades.
And her decision to abandon everything was absolutely insane.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday very soon had to happen.
In headquarters Markow there is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold.
The experts suggest that the care of leading This Morning, which enters into a number of the most significant British stars, may cost a company millions because of the huge investments in various goods--from pillows and candles to clothes and household goods, and because of any further delay in their operation.
And it can mean the end of long friendship.
The mother of Williamby and Dan Baldwin's husband had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cappe, for ten years.
Villaby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the presidency in March.
A couple of them rest together, and Jones owns the 40 percent part in the TV firm that's a television firm in Baldwin.
Willowby is a member of the M&S brand and replace Aunt McCarlene with a leading I.T. "I am a famous guy."
Last night the source, close to Jones, said, "We're not going to compromise his case."
So that's open talk, "that's what we fell in love with."
He stopped against the criticism you get from the mass information tools for his comment which is considered "non-president" for what it actually says about the North Korean leader.
Why does the President of Trump give up much?
Trump said to his fair "drive" in a voice.
"I do not deny anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore had been proclaimed Trumpa as a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization shift has gone to an end.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore leading North Korea, Lee Young-Ho announced a world leader at the AU General Assembly on the Saturday that the North for "the most eligible" in response to the previous steps of the Northern Korea in the area of disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the US continues to apply sanctions aimed at sustaining the pressure.
The journey took a much more optimistic position in its speech.
"We're extremely successful at building contact with the North Korean," he said.
"All could have ended with the war of North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have good articles."
He said that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim had led to positive results: the end of the rocket trials, the rescue of the hostages, and the return of the remains of the American soldiers home.
And he protected his extraordinary approach in talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to serve on the side of the President, but instead of 10,000 people who are trying to get through this crowded arena, we'll have about 200 people there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and the earthquake in India have devastated an island, and hundreds have died.
I mean, after the earthquake- -a foreign unfortunate organisation said they were obsolete.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lambok had been resettled, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not looking for international assistance, so it was a bit difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Save the Children Foundation and gather the crew to travel to Palau until it is clear that foreign officials can work in places.
Mr. Sutopo, a member of the National Agency for Combating Natural Disasters, said that Indonesian officials would appreciate the situation in Palau to find out if an international agency would be allowed to do so.
Despite the earthquakes that always befalls Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the random nature of nature.
Though refuges have been built in Achech, in other shores they are almost gone.
The apparent lack of syrene for warning of the tsunami in Palau led to a greater number of victims, although a warning there was.
Even in the best days, moving between many of the islands of India has turned out to be a difficult task.
And moral disasters have made movement difficult.
A sick ship that has been placed on the in. A lamp to treat a victim of earthquake is approaching Paul, but the way to a new place of distress will take at least three days.
The President, Jok Otterd, achieved a strong campaign to improve the infrastructure of the Indies, and spent money on motor vehicles and the railways.
But the lack of funding is pursued by Joe's administration as the next year will be a new election.
Mr. Jok is also faced with the pressure of interfaith tension in India, where members of the Muslim majority take a more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands banished from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using mastette, bows and shots and other cold weapons.
Daniel Oldridge of Liverpool is pushing a ball far against the Celsey
Daniel D.C. saved Liverpool from the Chelsea Prize, compared the number by 89th minute on the Saturday of London, with the number given in the ever since.
So the ancients got a transfer from Jardan Shakira when they were about 30 meters off of the building of Challsy gate, which was a number 1-0.
He made a vintage ball to the left of himself before making a shot in the distant trouser.
The attempt ended high beneath the top bar when the ball was flying into the right corner of the network.
The ball as a result flew over the head of the Kepah Archabaloggo, springing, directly into the net.
"He just tried to get to this position to hit the ball, and players like skate always tried to pull as far forward as possible, so I just tried to win us as possible," said the old man in an interview at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that running through Kante, made a light pass without thinking too much of it, and just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1:0 at the beginning of the second time, after the 25th minute hit by a Belgian star, Eden Azar.
Assaulting blue on this match made Matte Kovacz before returning to the semi-baronnais and running half the field at Liverpool.
The driver soon found himself in the middle of the field.
Then he made a positive blow by handing over Azarah's ball at the gate.
And he ran past the defender, and he ran off to the lower left in an angle in the far side of his trouser ahead of Alice Becker's Liverpool.
Liverpool competes with the "Palagio" in a group phase of the League of Champions at 3 p.m. in the Wednesday, at São Paulo Stadium, Italy.
Challsy has met the  lead in the League of Europe at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in India increased to 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and the tsunami in India rose to 832, and reported on the Sunday morning by the Agency for the Elimination of Natural Disasters.
At the press conference, Sutopo Nugroha stated that according to the messages many people got trapped in the ruins of the buildings which had collapsed as a result of the 7.5 percent earthquake that had occurred on Friday and caused waves up to seven meters high.
The city of Palu, where there are more than 380,000 people living, was piled with the wreckages of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was shot.
The murder investigation was started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merciside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with knife wounds in the area of Grayson-Muse in the street of John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called in to address them to people from this district who'd seen or heard anything.
Detective O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the early stages, but I want to turn to any one who's near John Street in Birkenhead or seen or heard anything suspicious and ask them to associate with us.
I also encourage all in particular taxictors who have filmed some video with us as they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation."
In closing the police confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own house.
This afternoon a woman's friends came to the scene to ask where she had been found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police stated that they are in the process of informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
A taximan living in Grayson Muses has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that nobody was allowed to come in or out of the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
The lodgers now say it will pass some more hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer explained to one person that the whole district now is a crime scene.
The woman broke out at the scene of action.
And she said, "That's so awful."

The compromise statue of Cromwell was the last century to be a memorable blow in the "writing history".
His removal would have been a poetic justice for him like that of the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
"But Cromwell's partnership described Mr. Creek's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmit, chairman of Cromwell's Court, said, "In the course of the present debate about the demography of the statue, it was inevitable that the monument of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace would be the object of these actions.
The fighting of the English civil wars was neither commanded nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps bad Cromwell will be taken to the victim for taking action by his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
The bright report of Mr. William Ham Tornicroft on Cromwell is a testimony to the thought of the 19th century and to part of the historian of a little girl who, as many people consider, must still be respected.
Mister Goldsmit said of the Sunday Telegraph: "A company of many know the late nineteenth century better than this today, as a defender of parliament from outer pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Is that completely precise idea; it's the subject of long historical debate.
No doubt the conflict of the middle of the 17th century formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual identifying figure representing one side of this encounter.
His achievements as a Lord-Protector are also worthy to be marked and respected."
The pig-killer bred to the death of a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in the market in the southern west of China.
"A man known only by the name of Jung, was found dead with broken arteries and sunken blood, near the laziness of the Lophanche market in the Huizg province," reported the South China Post Sunday.
Swinjavod was preparing to enter a pigfowl into the pighole on 30 May 2005 in the blue of the Chinese province of Chinhai.
He reported that he and his cousin in Wednesday came from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pig prices to the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the neighbouring china opened.
He said that there was a large barn in the pighole with blood on the dog.
In the report, the medical forensics actually said that they had destroyed a farmer for some 550 kilograms.
"My cousin's feet have been exposed and corrupted," said a cousin with the name of Wu.
The camera video showing that Yuan went to market at 04:40 to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market informed Eveing News that the pig was shut up to prevent an attack on anyone else, while the police were collecting evidence on the scene of action.
According to reports, the Yuan family and the market administration share the talks about compensation for his death.
While pigs ’ attacks on people are rare, they've been before.
So in 2016 the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm at Massachusetts State, and the result was that a man got serious injuries.
Ten years before the pig-weighted weight of 650 pounds had pressed a Babylonian farmer to her tractor and kept it until his wife let go of the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon State had been eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer said to CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a downside.
"They're just boisterous.
They're delicious, and they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to give them the right number of respect," he said.
The sequence of the Roa's enemy makes heavy pouring rains south-west of the United States.
It is estimated that Hurricane Rose is weaker because of moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, the Rose will bring floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The Rose Speed, hurricane 1 category, amounted to 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. Eastern time on the Sunday, and it was recorded to be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
The Rose, it's expected, will go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, we start to form a low- pressure region, which travels east to the western coast of the United States. If on Monday, "Rosa" comes to the peninsula of Lower California, in the form of a tropical storm, it will start pushing deep tropical wind toward the north, toward the south west of the United States.
And on Monday, "Rosa" will take parts of Mexico as many as 10 inches of precipitation.
Then tropical moisture, which interacts with the coming low- pressure area, within the coming days, calls for strong valleys in the south-west.
There are areas from 1 to 4 inches of precipitation calling for dangerous flash floods, village streams and possible floods in the desert.
The per-capita co-location will cause the number of precipitations to be 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the Northwest, especially in the greater part of Arizona, expected 2 to 4 inches [- 4 inches] of precipitation.
Because cloud rain falling down a lot of sites, it's possible for a sudden flood of conditions to occur.
It would be extremely undesirable to go out on a foot in the desert because of the threat of tropical rainfall.
The strong rain can cause the Canyon to turn into raging rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by steamy winds and dust.
The coming low- pressure area makes it possible to rain heavily on the coast of South California.
Possible maximum precipitations of more than half an inch can lead to a tiny stream of garbage and make a slippery road.
It'll be the first left in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains come close to Orison at the end of the Sunday and early on Monday before the rain went everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread in the district of Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October the United States, there may be strong temperature declines, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this will lead to drastic temperature changes in the near future.
There's a good example of a sudden temperature change in the central part of the U.S. on a Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amaya, Nebraska, St. Louis, and De Myanmar, Iowa, the temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees.
For the next few days, the extra summer heat will try to get established and spread again.
It's expected that in many central and eastern states of the United States, a warm October going from 80 degrees south to part of the Northeast.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows the high probability of high temperatures in the eastern part of the United States before the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched the listen of Brett Kwan.
Over 20 million people on six television networks were watching interesting testimony from a Thursday in the Upper Court of Justice in the case between Bret Kavan and Christine Blace Ford, who accused him of sexual assault which was supposed to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political resistance goes on, the speakers interrupted their regular programs as a benefit of the news on Friday: the agreement developed by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it had been one of those weeks' investigations of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Bureau that she's 100 percent sure Covan's drunks were grabbing her and was trying to pull her clothes off at an older school dinner.
Covean in his hot evidence said it's 100% sure it wasn't.
Maybe more than 20.4 million people, whom the Nielsen campaign reported on Friday, looked at him.
The company has calculated the average number of spectators for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks which showed this including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And in the Nielsen company, there are usually problems with measuring people watching TV in their offices.
To compare: the size of the audience is the same as in a play-of-the-blank or Oscar playing.
"The Fox News Canal, whose experts strongly supported the assignment of Covan, operated all over the network, with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day," stated Nielsen.
ABC took the second place with 3.26 million spectators.
"CBS was 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNC was 2.89 million, and CNN was 2.52 million," stated Nielsen.
The interest remained high, and after listening.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the employed moderated republic had published a statement that he would vote in support of Covan, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when the protestors were shouting at his address, and when he tried to raise his elevator to the hearing in the Judicial Chamber.
He stood with his eyes sunk for a few minutes when he was being loved, and it was broadcast in direct air by CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
'Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have authority, but a lot of women are deprived of it."
Flake said his office published a statement, and said before the elevator shut up, that he had something else to say at the hearing in the closet.
All cable networks, for several hours, were broadcast live when the Judicial Bureau had to decide upon the choice of Kavan's license in the senate.
But Flake said he would do it just because he realized that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, which would encourage minority democracies.
Flake was convinced partly by the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Kuns.
After that conversation with Kuns and a couple of Flake's senators,
Flake's choice had power, because it was obvious that there would be no voices in the Republic to establishvan without investigation.
The president of Trump began an investigation into the charges against Kavan at the FBI.
Prime Minister May accused of playing "game in politics" because of the brexita
During the interview with the Sunday Times Prime Minister Theresa May was accused by the criticism that she was planning to leave the European Union that they were "playing in politics" with the future of Britain and that they were undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conference of the Conservative Party in British Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In one of the interviews near her at the first headline of the newspaper was her former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, who spoke against her so-called "ance-and-sex" plan, stating that the proposal to have the Great Britain and the EC have the only fares, was "quite ridiculous."
Murders by Wade Sims: the police arrested the suspected LSU player Simpson.
The police arrested a suspected mortal victim at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from a team at the University of Louisiana.
"The 20-year-old Diteon Simpson was arrested and placed in a prison accused of murdering another," reported the police leadership of the Baton-Rose.
The causes showed a video on the shooting between Simsam and Simpshan and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses in the shooting.
"The police took the glasses from the scene and said they had their DNA detected," says WAFB, a branch of CBS.
After questioning Simpson the police said he confessed death at Wade.
"A facility is set at $350,000," says Advocate.
The subsequent execution of East Batana-Ruze published on Friday the previous report, which said that the cause of death is an acute wound to the head and the neck.
Louisiana State Police Task Force Department, State Criminal Laboratory, South University police asking for help from people in the district to investigate the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Aleva, thanked the district's law enforcement authorities for their “stress and striving for justice”.
Sims was only 20 years old.
Attacking six feet grew to Baton Rue, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the Louisiana University team.
In the middle of the last season, he had 5.6 points, 2.6 meetings per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball team at the University of Louisiana, will Wade, who was a coach, said that the team was devastated and a shock to Wade's death.
"That's what I'm always worried about," said Wade.
The volcano evasives ash in Mexico City
The ash, which is caused by the Pacatapethl volcano, reached the southern region of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre on Prevention of Natural Disasters, on the Saturday, suggested to the Mexicans that they should stay away from the volcano after the attraction had turned out to be activity, and for 24 hours, 183 incidents of gas and ashes were recorded.
In the center there was a hearsay and a feel of jolting.
Excavations in social networks have shown that in around Mexico City, such as the Sachimilka, there are thin layers of papery covering on the car windshield.
Geophysics observed a increase in the activity of a volcano, which is located within 45 miles (72 km) of the south-east of the steel station after a magnitude earthquake of 7.1, in the central part of Mexico, in the September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has remained active since 1994.
Meeting the police with Catalan Separatists just outside the anniversary of the voice for independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the admirers of independence had met the police in public order, and thousands more had joined the demonstration in signifying the first anniversary of the polarization of the voting by the partitioning of Catholicism.
A group of separatists, in masks, who were held back by the public order policemen, threw around their eggs and bloomed with powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets which are usually filled with tourist populations.
Later that very day the fight broke out when the police used their oaks to deter the demonstrators.
For several hours the independence group that scandaled "Don't forget, do don't forgive" encountered union figures present shouting, "Living Spain."
According to the messages of the local press, fourteen people have gone through a cure for slight injuries derived in the course of a protest action.
The tension in the region which seeks independence is high one year after the recommendation of October 1st, which Madrid declared illegal but which was observed by the Catholic separatists.
The candidates in the vast majority chose independence, though the chooser's egg was low, which was largely explained by the flickering of voices.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured after the police had tried to stop voting in scattered sites all over the region as a result of angry demonstrators.
The independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the Spanish national police.
The demonstration went on, but the protesters had to go on and on.
Of the 68-year-old Narcissus Termes, the electrician who is present for the Separatist stage with his wife, said that he no longer has any hope of gaining independence from Canada.
"We've experienced one of the best moments here.
I've seen my parents cry for joy when they could vote; but now we're tired," he said.
Despite the vital but insignificant victory of the regional elections in December of last year, the Catalan parties in favour of independence tried their best to keep the momentum this year with many of their most famous leaders and found themselves either in voluntary exile or in captivity, awaiting trials for arranging the referendum and the following notification of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanicsman, Joan Puch, who writes a protest in support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was dealt with by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junees, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in SlSA since the end of the past year, announced that they would participate in the elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Celection as a candidate for European elections is the best way to judge the regression of democratic values and the recessions that we have seen from the government of Spain," he said.
Londoners: men arrested after they cut down a house on the car.
Three men, age 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car had repeatedly fallen into a house in London.
The incident was held in the district of Belignard-Crecent on Thursday, at about 19:30 p.m., in British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said it was a damage to the gate and the building itself.
Perhaps at some point in the car there was a bullet in the car.
As a result of a blow by Mang Lüningstan, there is a win for Rangers number 1:0.
Lithuania's first goal of the fate of Mangi was a victory for them.
"Leatingstan" spoke to Rangers, and it was enough to assign Stephen Jarard after he had a few impacts in 18 games on the position of manager of an Ibrox club.
Beat Daily Mangi was great, because Gary Holt got up to one level with the Hitlers in the second division.
Jarard's team that season won't win the show to the prime office and meet the leaders, the Harts team, for the next Sunday.
We're going to have to ask ourselves a question before or if they're going to see what they think about it. What's happening in Europe?
"Livingstan," meanwhile, continued his harmless series, up to six games, and the leading coach, Holt, was still paralysing after Kenie Miller's replacement last month.
"Livingstan" misses chances because of rough visitors
The Holt team had to be warned long before they had killed, but that's the sort of call it to the Rangers call.
Scott Robinson had broken through, but lost his chance of killing in the gate; after that, Alan Leth was able only to press his efforts wider to meet the strike of Craig Hallet.
landlords were happy to allow Rangers to play in front of them knowing they might bother the guests at some points.
And that's how it was achieved.
From the Rangers side, a fine was allowed, and "Livingstan" worked up a debut, Declan Galeher and Robinson united to overcome Mengu, who did pass and kill from the center of the field.
So by this point, Rangers had dominated, but it turned out that defending the team was inappropriate, and Liam Callie's Bro was actually almost turned off
So went on in the second half, though Alfred Marelas had really saved Callie.
The ball from Scott Pitman was reflected by the Rangers Broker Alan McGreggard, and Ltgows moved far away from the second system of "Luingstan."
The balls constantly fell in upon the gate of "Leatingstan" and were reflected, while two requirements of the panes, after being called upon to replace Glen Meadltan, and requiring the execution of the game by hand, were rejected.
“Phenomene” from “Livingstan” - Analysis
BBC Journalist Scottland Alesder Lamant at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal productivity and results for the Likingstan.
For men they were marvellous, continuing to digest expectations of this rising pavement.
Their game style and composition have practically not changed since they came back to the upper echelon, but it is worth giving them the proper Hall for the way in which it has encouraged the command since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulket was a grand fellow, building up a well-organized defence, while Menga held Konar Goldsan and Joe Waral all over the field.
Rangers missed inspiration.
However kind they were at Jersey, they did not comply with those standards.
In the last match they didn't own, just once scored at a gate that there was something kind of a disturbing bell for the Rangers which appeared in the middle of the list.
The mingled attitude toward Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, we had a smile, and they felt hopeless dreaming when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdagana's spore visit to Germany, which aims at re-establishing the relationship between Sociétologists and Nata.
They had a problem with human rights, freedom of the press and the participation of Turkey in the EC.
Erdagan made his way to Cologne to open a new gigantic ball.
There is probably one of the biggest Soviets in the city outside Turkey.
The police came out on security grounds not to let 25,000 people come together before the ball, but here comes a lot of followers to see their president.
hundreds of protesters against Erdaghan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both the policy of Erdahan and the decision of the government of Germany to welcome him to the country.
The protests for and against reflect the discord of the guest who has been convicted by the German Turks and who has been convicted by others as autocrats.

The static police said that their employees are working to identify the man and report him to their closest kinsman.
About that place, cars and bus stoppings, and it was recommended that a car should be avoided in the area.
Long Laarcin prison: Six staff members wounded during disturbances
"Six prison officials have been injured as a result of riots in a maximum-security prison for men," states the Retirement Report.
The row broke out in Long Larsen prison at Wustershire at 09:30 British time on a Sunday and then went on until then.
To combat the mess that the eight prisoners are participating in, an ad hoc group, Trnada, was involved.
There's a collaboration scene that's been curled by the petty injuries.
In addition to the Retirement Service said, "A specially trained prison person was sent to fight against those who committed riots in the Long Larsen prison.
Six employees went through a cure after they got injured.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and it's clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and able to spend more time behind the bars."
The Royal Long Larsen prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was passing a cure in the hospital after the prisoner had been attacked.
And in October of the previous year, police officers at public order were summoned to prison to deal with serious disturbances, during which officials were attacked with water balls.
Hurricane Roza threatens the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong floods (which can be useful for dry regions)
Tropical enemies are rarely present in Arizona, but that's exactly what can happen at the beginning of the next week, because the tracks of the enemy Rose in the southwest part of the desert, forming the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service already published its data on Monday and Tuesday about sudden floods in western Arizona and in south and east Neda, southeastern California and Utah, including Felix, Flagstaff, Los Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's expected that Tuesday "Rose" will take a straight path through Phoenix, approaching the rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service at Phoenix has indicated on Twitter that only "Ten tropical bulbs have brought a tropical storm or a drop of pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
"Catra" (1967) was an enemy 40 miles from the state of Arizona.
The last model, the National Centre of hurricanes predicts a fall from 2 to 4 inches, so it can reach 6 inches in the district of Mahallion in Arizona at a single level.
In other parts of the southern region, the desert, including the central rocky groves and the big basine, is likely to be from 1 to 2 inches in value, with a separate effective value of up to 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of a sudden flood, Hurricane Rose could be found to be long-term because of the drought in their region.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of these falls are likely to be of use, because droughts are now being observed in the southern west.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Agency, at least a little over 40 percent of the territory of Arizona is experiencing a different category of extreme drought," reportsweather.com.
First, the path of the Hurricane Rose leads to a fall in the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On a Sunday morning, the Rose still had the power of a hurricane, with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles an hour at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and moving north at a speed of 12 miles an hour.
The storm would meet with more cold water in the Pacific Ocean and so on, it would come true.
So it's expected that in Mexico when a tropical storm approaches, the river will come out of the shores afternoon or evening on Monday.
Precipitances in many parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a considerable risk of drowning.
"expected the total number of precipitations from 3 to 6 inches from Low California to Northwestern Sanlrah, where possible precipitation up to 10 inches," reportedweather.com.
Then the Rose will move north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm, before reaching the line of Arizona early in the morning in the form of a tropical fall of pressure, which will then proceed through Arizona and the southern part of Utah by the evening of Tuesday.
"The real danger is expected of "Russia" or its remnants, it's very strong rain in lower California and in the north-west of Sanora and South-west United States desert," reports the National Hurricane Centre.
It is expected that these rains will result in life's threatening and sudden floods and rural streams and footfalls in the highlands.
Ported to Midsamer Norton: four attempts to arrest the murderers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of trying to kill after finding a 16-year-old body with lots of knife wounds at Samersett.
Three teenage boys were found wounded in the Terrassexier District at Midsair Norton about 4 hours on Saturday.

"Kavano is bypassed by the palate and wrath of the Democratic Party," said Trump.
"The head of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for the abolition of the disembodied and outrageous tactic of the Democratic Party," reported Trump to the front of the city of Vilnius, East Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh was "packaged from frontality and anger" The Democratic Party in the course of his post-election process.
It's covetously given notices in front of Cungues on Thursday, intensively and emotionally denying the charges of blissy Ford having sexually abused her for decades when they were still a teenager.
Ford also gave testimony during the proceedings concerning her charges.
On Saturday the President said that "this day Americans saw brilliant, fine and brave" Cavanaugh.
"Name in support of Judge Cavanaugh is one of the most perfect experts in the field of our time, a lawyer with a great history of public service," he declared to a crowd of followers of West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to a Cavanaugh selection, speaking about the importance of the Republican eggs during the mid-elections.
"Five weeks left till one of the most choices of our time.
I'm not just late, but I'm really late," he answered.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates."
The journey is not acceptable that Demacrats intend to "contrary and obstruct."

Hundreds of people died as a result of earthquake and tsunamis in India, the number of victims increased
"At least 384 people died, many disappeared as a result of the onset of gigantic waves on the beaches, when on the Indian island of Sulawesi began a violent earthquake and tsunami," declared on the Saturday of power.
Hundreds of people flocked to a beach festival in Pale City on Friday, when waves six meters (18 feet) high, pounded on the shore at dusk, kill many to death and destroy everything in their path.
There was 7.5 tsunamis in the aftermath of the magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threatened last night, people were still on the beaches and did not immediately escape, and they became victims," stated a brigging in Jakarta, a press secretary of the Indonesian disaster management agency, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
"The tsunami swept cars, logs, houses, striking all about the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (to 497 miles /h) before the impact on the shore line.
He said that some people survived just because they went up the trees to run away from the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 center Paul.
The paintings published by the Natural Disaster Agency showed that a lot of buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were spinning and falling, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The following jolts kept hopping down the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes took place in a district with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indian Authority's rating and use of technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by a strong earthquake in Friday is about 200 times that of an atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima in the second world war.
According to his data, the geography of a town, which is at the end of the long narrow cove, could increase the size of the tsunami.
The Nugroman called the damage to the Shire and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the whole of some victims were found under the wreckages of destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had been missing without stories.
"The victims and the damage may be greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Pal, an area called Dongal, which is nearer the epicenter of Earths," said Nugroha.
Dongal's relationship "was completely damaged," said Nugroha.
"There's more than 300,000 people there," said the statement of Red Cross, adding that his staff and volunteers had been sent to the affected district.
"It is already a tragedy, but it might be much worse," he said.
It was widely reported on Saturday by the agency that they did not report the tsunami in Paul, but the officials declare that the waves came at the time a warning was issued.
In amateur photos published on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperate to expose to people on the street a warning of the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes the wall of the water fell on the shore, dragging after it would be a load of cars.
Returners could not at once confirm the authenticity of the extracted material.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a serious power cut-off, which disrupts communication around Paul, so it was difficult for the government to design saving actions.
And the U.S. authorities said that the U.S. military began sending freight planes through Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated ones were still very welcome and needed.
The city's airport was opened only to provide help and would be closed before October.
So on Sunday, the president of Joe Via planned to visit the Evacuation Centre in Palau.
Over 800 people lost as a result of the tsunami in India
That is very bad.
"While the World Vision staff from Dungal made their way successfully to the city of Palu, where the workers are hiding in the tarsier huts installed into the courtyards of their office, on the road they saw the scene of the wasteland," said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he related.
That is very bad.
Even when help groups have begun to take grim action to start relief mechanisms in the face of disasters, some have complained that foreign workers with deep knowledge prevent them from going to Palau.
According to the Indonesian rule, funding, supply and personage from abroad can only begin to proceed if the location of the disaster is declared by the zone of national disaster.
This hadn't happened yet.
'It's still a disaster at the right level,' said Aolia Arriani, the press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government has said, "Okay, that's a national disaster," we can open this up for international help, but we can't show this status yet.
And on the other night in Palau, after an earthquake and a tsunami on Friday, friends and family disappeared without news that their nearby sugar would be among those that would leave the miserable landscape lines of natural disasters.
On Saturday the little boy was dismissed from the sewer.
On a Sunday the economists released the woman who had two days been under ruins, and beside her was the body of her child.
Hendon Subandon, a coach of the Indonesian national team on paraplanning, prepared two of the missing Paraplanes for the Asian Games, which were concluded earlier this month in India.
Mr. Mandag, including the others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were his disciples.
"I am a senior paraplaneress in the field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told me how, a few hours after the paraplaners' community had spread the news of the destruction of the Royal Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages to Palu's who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with a single grey gnarle, not with two blue.
"That means that messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 during the Newport banking on the Levy
"On Friday the thief stole $26 750 from Brink's employee, who was putting bills at a bank at Newport's in Libya," says a Newport police deport's press release.

Cany West: Rapper changes his name to Ye ("you").
Raper Kayney West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced his change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I am officially known as Kany West.
West, 41 years old, used that nickname as the name for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change occurs just before his appearance at the Sunday Night Live, where he is expected to start his new Yandhi album.
It replaces Arian Grande's singer with a show, which was shut down for "moral reasons," said the show's creator.
The level- -with the reduction of his now professional name West before said that it's a religious word for him.
I believe it's "you" -- the most common word in the Bible, and it's "you," in the Bible -- I said to West early this year by discussing the album's title with a radio show.
So I--it's you, I--it's us, it's all us--we
This came from Keny, which means "one" to just "e" -- reflecting our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
Album is more a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the most famous rappers who ever changed his name.
Sean Combus was otherwise known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was bowing to the names of Love and Brothers Love.
There was a fellow of West, J.Z. and he did it in dissension and in general letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use an army against civilians
President Andress Manuel López Abdord would never use a military force against a civilian population because the country is approaching 50 years of the day of the bloody recession against the students.
On Saturday, on Tlatelco Plaza López Abrador lovers "never to use military men to defeat the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968 the Soviets shot down a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people, while the leftmost student movements took control of the whole of Latin America.
Lopes Abdordre partners support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to students, thus opening up more free places in government universities.
"The lack of educational opportunities and the absence of educational opportunities attracts young people to criminal groups," he said.
The United States has to double its funding for your machine intelligence.
"As China becomes more and more active in the area of machine intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount they spend in research in the field," says an investor and specialist on the Ky-Foo Lee machine intelligence that worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came out after various parts of the U.S. government have made a statement about the media, even if there's no official strategy in the U.S. for media.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: by 2030, it had been trying to be the first in the area of innovation in the media.
"Twiceing a budget for research in the media area would be a good start, considering that all other countries are behind the United States, and we're waiting for the next breakthrough in the MI area," said Lee.
"Twice of funding can double the likelihood that the next great drive of media will be successful in the United States," stated Lee at CEBC this week.
Lee, whose book Trees of Machine Intelligence: China, the Silver Valley, and the New World Order, were published this month by Hoton Mifflin Harkurt, is the principal executive director of the Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most famous media campaigns in China, face ++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Malana, he was working on a system of machine intelligence that defeated the most well-functioning American player, Atel, and then he was head of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese section of Google in China.
Lee recognized prior US government technology competitions, such as employment competitions from the Agency's advanced defence research project, and asked when the next one will be to help identify the next ones.
"US researchers have often had to work hard to get government grants," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's a corporation," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have, in the past few years, hired university candles to work on media.
Lee said that changing immigration policy can also help the United States intensify its efforts in the field of machine intelligence.
"I think green cards should automatically show up as a candidate in the media field," he said.
The cool advice of China came out of the next generation's design of machine intelligence in the tree of 2017.
"The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in educational institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations raise money for U.S. researchers, but the quality of the academic work in China is below," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a United Machine Intelligence Center, which required partners in industry and scientific circles to participate in, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
So over the course of this month, the forward research project's advocacy agency announced a 2 billion dollar worth of investment in the field of protection.
In the case of the National Scientific Organization (NSF) it's currently invested in media research of over 100 million dollars a year.
Meanwhile, a U.S. official who was trying to create the National Security Commission -- in machine intelligence -- did not observe what he was doing for months.
Macedonian voices on a recommendation for changing the country name
On a Sunday, the people of Macedonia made a recommendation to change the name to "The Republic of North Macedonia", which would allow a ten-year-old dispute with Greece that blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATA.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, states that her northern neighbour's name is a claim to her territory, and has sat on both Nata and EC.
In June both governments made a deal with the proposed new name but the Nazi officials said that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the famous Macedonian population.
President George Ivan stated that he wasn't going to vote on the referendum, and the falsity company questioned the question whether the voters' egg would meet the minimum of 50 percent required to make the referendum.
The question there is, "You're for a membership in NATA and EC, and you're in agreement with Greece."
Following a change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zay, they say it's a price that's worth taking to bodies like EC and NATA Macedonia, one of the countries that happened to be after Yugoslavia.
"I came today to space for the future of this country, for young people in Macedonia, so they can live free under the guidance of the European Union, because it means a more secure life for all of us," said Oliver Georgiewski, 79 years old, Skopje.
Though this is not bound by legal force enough number of members of parliament said that it would take into account the results of voting to make it decisive.
Changing your name will take over two thirds to parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that by 1 hour no report had been received on the violations.
But it did make up only 16 percent in comparison with the 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of the voters were registered.
"I came to vote for my children's sake, our place is in Europe," stated a 62-year-old voters at the capital at Skopje José Tanileski.
Prime Minister Zoran Zee, his wife, and his son, Dewszka were white for a referendum in Macedonia, devoted to changing the name of the country which will open the way for her to join NATA and the European Union, in Stramica, Macedonia, September 30th, 2018.
Before the 54's Parliamentary House in Skopje, Vladimir Cavardarki prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of a tent set by those who will bike the referendum.
"We're for the Nata and the EU, but we want to integrate with raised heads, not through a service door," said the Cowards.
"We are a poor country, but we have honour.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can address others, like China and Russia, and we can become a part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zay said that friendship in NATA would make the necessary investment in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate was over 20 percent.
'I believe the overwhelming amount will be for, because over 80 percent of our citizens support EC and NATA,' said Zaya after the vote.
He said that the result of "yes" would be the confirmation of our future.
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute of Political Research, they say that in a recommendation to take part from 30 to 43 percent of the voters, which is below the requirement of an egg.
Another survey carried out by the Macedonian television channel showed 57 percent of those polled who were planning to vote on the Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they were "yes."
And for a successful recommendation [inaudible] eggs must be 50 percent plus one voice.
[Pronouncer] This is going to be the first major blow to the policy of the interim government since he came into office last May.
Look there. Sergio Aguera of Manchester City walks to the gate through the entire Briton defense.
On Saturday, Sergio Aguera and Rahim Störling solved the problem of defending against the Britan Battle of Manchester City with a number two: 0 at the Etihad stage in Manchester, England.
And it was with ease that Aguer did it at 65 minutes.
Argentine assailant got a pass in the middle of the field.
He was rushing between three Britanists before hitting in the open field.
Then Agur found herself among the four green shirts.
He passed by one defender and pipped some more at the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed on the left flank by finding Sterling.
An British attacking first tortilla on Aguer's ball, who was using his right stab to get around the Britan column by Matthew Ryan to hit on the right side of the network.
"Aguera has some problems with her legs," said the journalist in the town of Pep Gurdioll.
"We were talking about how he was playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We're lucky that he killed the goal at the very moment."
But it was Sirling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the fight against prime-life.
That goal was held for the 29th minute.
Aguera got that ball deep into British territory.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy San.
Sain made a few touches before Sterling was able to reach the far side of his trouser.
An attack on the Blues called a ball into the network before the other shot down the border.
Hofenheim actually played a group of champions at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at Rhine-Ncarre Arena in Zensheim, Germany.
Sherner would like to play the "selecting points" against Rocky
After the Nationals had been shut off from the competitions in play-of, there was no particular reason to set a new start.
But constantly competitive Sherzer is hoping to take a shot at Sunday against the Rocky Color, but only when there's still a legacy of play-of-the- Rocke for Rocky, who stays at leaders after one game at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the North West.
The years were conquered, at least, by an unambiguous victory space of 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still hoping to get their first title in the division.
"Even though we're playing just so, at least, we can handle the situation by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, the crowd and other teams will be made up in such a way that the game can probably be on the highest level of everyone I've encountered this year.
Why didn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced a Sunday start, but they are said to be apt to give Sherzer a ball in this situation.
Shercher, who was going to do his 34th start, had a PCP session on Thursday and will be on a Sunday afternoon.
Washington D.C. 18/07 out of 2,533 E.V. and 300 out of 220,2/3 hits this season.
Trump is playing in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around him in his choice of Bret Kavano High Court, speaking about the importance of an election of republics in intermediate elections.
"All we have done is threatened in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our life.
It was one of the big, big--I'm not late, but I'm really late, so I'm fighting everywhere for the big candidates," he said.
And Trump went on, "You see that horrible, monstrous democrat radical group, see that this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power, using any necessary means, you see, to subservience, frost.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, whom they're supposed to beat to get power and control, it's what they want, it's the power and the control we're not going to give them."
He says that democrats have the intention of "to resist and prevent."
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "wicked, mean, other and false."
He was saved upon by the Senate's ship-chamber still recognition by the senator of the democratic group Diana Feinstein, who received a loud rating from the audience.
And she said, "Do you remember her answer?
You have allowed the document to be exported?
Uh-huh.
No, I do not expect--it was a very bad nonverbal language--the worst language I have ever seen."
Working is no longer the basis of a church.
It is impatient for the people who make their opinion
When the activists of Momentum in my local party were shrugged for having to wounded me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last in a row of members of parliament from the Labour Party, who's told that we're not welcome--all to make our opinion known.
My parliament's colleagues, Joan Ryan, they got the same problem, because it firmly resists anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship would tell me that I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, by the irony of fate, something similar that Jeremy had not agreed with previous leaders.
And the report of the meeting -- which was actually held on Friday of the Nottingham Eastern Lebary Party -- says that "we want these meetings to be interactive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local parliamentary member of the Labour Party, these meetings were held on Friday
Unfortunately, today in most meetings the tone not so and a promise "more good, more soft" politics has long been forgotten, if indeed ever was.
It's becoming more and more apparent that the lesbian party has different views. And every judgment is judged from a point of view whether it's acceptable for a party-led guide or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because the colleagues I had believed I would share the same political views began to hope that I would take a step back, and they took a position with which I would not mention anything — in national security or on the only EU market.
Every time I've spoken in public -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- there's a front bar in social networks where I call for undoing elections, because I'm not in the Leobarist Party anymore.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I've been fortunate more than a few of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are generally political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face a stream of sexual or racist acts, but never vary.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of abuses.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Lambaris Party had to develop a culture of tolerance.
Reality is that we're no longer organizations that take different views, and with each movement in uncertainty or changing the rules for selecting a party becomes a smaller one.
For the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice which has called upon me to don't give up spirits, to be not so loud, and then with me everything will be okay.
But that's not what I went to politics for.
Since I had joined the Leibarist 32 years ago as a school student in charge of the government of Tetcher, on which my student in high school failed, I had striven to stand up for the best public services for those in their need most--let it be a local resident or government minister.
I never buried my political views, including those of the past.
No one in East Nottinge could at all be entangled in my political positions and in the clouts of tension with the present guidance.
For those who have fought for this movement on Friday, I should like to say that, if the country is directed to Brexit, which is frowned upon by the homeowner, by the enterprises and our public services, I fail to understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not a Nottingham Momentum, it is my voters, whether it is a member of the lobbyer, or not: I am proud that serving you, and I promise that no threat of undoing the elections will and political will prevent me from taking action in the interests of all of you.

Ir Melrós 38-17: Invincible Ir at the top
Two later attempts might have said a few words to the end, but undoubtedly Air deserved a triumph in this strangely interesting pre-Ligie Tennent match.
Now they're setting up a tourist table, one side of the ten.
After all, it was their highest protection, just like their best chance that had made their masters, that coach Peter Murcev had the complete right to be satisfied.
"We have still tried our games till now, and we are still invincible; therefore I must be happy," he said.
Robin Cristie of Melrows said, 'Give up the proper Eura, he dared more than we are.'
Grant Andersan's 14 minute attempt that turned Fraser Klim into a foreground, but his yellow card for Scotland took on Warriors, allowed Melrose to tap numbers, and Jason Baggot took an unrealized attempt.
The blog sprained Eire's leader with a Toolbar before, right at the break, he killed and then committed a good shot at it by making 17-5 Eir's stop.
But Melrossus began well in half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, turned into a goddess, reduced the backlog to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injuries of Ruard Nott, which was stretched out, and after a restarting of Air made progress through the attempt of Staffing McDowell, the implementation of the Climes.
Eir, carrying out the duties of Captain Blair McFurson, received a yellow card, and again Mellysus forced another man to pay through an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of February pressure.
However the landlord returned, and when Strain Hutchin received the yellow card for having struck the Clime without a ball from the line of fine, McFurson landed behind Eir.
The climate had realized its attempt, which had done again almost after the relaunch, after Kyle Row had received David Armstrong's blow in a fine and sent messenger Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the owners of the field.
Star Still Game seems ready for a new career in a restaurant business
However, a star of the Ford Kieran game is going to enter the hotel business industry after it was found that it was intended to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
And the 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show that he's writing and he's filming with the old comedy partner, Greg Hemfield.
Duet announced that the next nine-series became the last in the series of shows, and I guess Kern plan to take a step further after Craig.
By official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
Actor refused to write a story, though the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Cairn would be expected to participate in the "blossom trade in Glasg".
"Woe to us": Bolivia, which has no going out to sea, is hoping that the court will once again open its path to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Citizens' buildings would've been under the blue flag.
There's a saying, from the Vatican River to the Amazon, that's drawing our Star on the Right.
Assuming is our responsibility.
In all of Bolivia, which has no way to get to sea, the memory of the shore-line lost by Chile in the bloody conflict, is due to the resources of the 19th century, still alive--like a wish to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have probably reached the top in the last few decades, because Bolivia is awaiting a decision by an international court of Justice on October 1st, after five years of debate.
"The Bible has a pulse, a spirit of loneliness and tranquillity, and certainly it looks forward to a positive result," said the Balticpimator Rébert Calvin.
Many Baltics will observe the decision of the IPU on large screens all over the country, hoping that the tributary in Gaza after decades of intensive wins will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is obliged to conclude the negotiations concerning the granting of a sovereign passage to sea.
Evo Morales is the grim President of Bolivia. It is faced with the fight for re-election next year.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think that the court will hardly take a decision in Bolivia's favor, and that's a little to change, even if it does.
The AN organization, which is based in the Netherlands, has no right to make a decision about the Chile Territory and has stated that there will be no possible negotiations.
That the International Court of Justice comes out just six months after it was considered to have the final arguments- -that it was not a difficult case,' stated a Chilean expert in the field of international law of Paz Zarate.
And without furthering Bolivia's case, the last four years have probably pushed it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Baltic administration," said Sarat.
She said that Marales' military rhetoric had lost some of her former Chilean kindness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak, but after that, the discussion will be very difficult.
Since 1962, two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
The former President, Edward Radriges Weltz, a representative of Bolivia in Gaza, rejected the idea that passing a court decision was unusually fast.
Monday brings Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to discover a new age of connection with Chile" and an opportunity "to put an end to 139 years of common ground," he said.
Calvin also denied that Morales--still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America- -used the marine problem as a political apothema.
"The Bahamas will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"There is clearly an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ry Young Ho, says that his country will never cease to use its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ree spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the U.N.
He called upon the United States to keep the promise made at Singapore's summit between the leaders.
State director Mike Pampea seems to be on the verge of re-establishing nuclearumulate with North Korean Kim Cheng Eon more than three months after Singapore.
Ry says it's an "undesirable dream" to have long sanctions and U.S. objection to the declaration of war end in Korea. They just put the North on their knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration if P'enhan does not first begin significant disarmament steps.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump demand a second summit.
But there is a great scepticism about the fact that Pianne is seriously concerned with renouncing the arsenal which the country is probably considering as the only way to ensure his or her safety.
Pampea plans to visit Pianne the next month to prepare for the second Kim Trump summit.
On Paris's fashionable showing we saw the most new line in the massive gills on the way to the shop in your towns
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer search.
The Vantino and Tom Browne were represented by a lot of unusual head coverings for their SS19 collection, which crossed the waiting list of Paris Fashion Week.
This summer in Instagram was conquered by a population of impractical hats who designed their creations on the show-in-the-blank.
The marked Valentino rice was a luxurious refugee hat, ornamented with broad fields like feathers that filled the heads of models.
Other actresses of unusually large size included jewels of watermelon, wizard hats, and even pineapples, but they were not intended to keep their head warm.
Tim Brown also showed the assembly of bizarre masks--just up to Halloween.
Many of the coloured masks were with sewn lips and more like Hanibal Lekter than high fashion.
One of them looked like a dig for underwater swimming with a pipe and a protective spectacle, and the other like- the drenched cone of a seaman.
And if you keep following those great fashion attributes, you're fortunate.
Those who follow the style predict that huge hats can break into our everyday lives.
So his hat's a huge size going up his heels to La Bomba, a straw hat with two feet wide, which you can see in all, from Riana to Emily Rataiki.
A circular label on a very uncomfortable hat, which had been dissolved in social networks, blithely upon a further great formation at the indoor--a straw beach bag, almost as large as the model with this bag, dressed in a merchant.
The dark orange bag made up of a Mafia, ornamented with a Rave and covered with a white leather handle, became an extract part of the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 on the fashion week in Paris.
And famously, Luke Armitage said, "I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, since the designer has had a great effect, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for unfettered accessors."
Speaking languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world.
And independent schools in Scotland are fast forward in academic success, which is to say, from 2018 on, with another very good test outcome, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in dispute, art, music and other creations of society.
More than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, a school represented by the Scotch Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to ensure a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for the further education they've chosen with their careers and place as citizens of the world.
As the education sector that can develop and inculcate individual schools we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a person in whatever language he understands, it remains in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a bright reminder that we can't hope only in English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
With the results of the last exam this year, we see that languages are at the top in the league table with the highest performance indicators in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who had learned foreign languages received a higher answer than A.
The data collected in 74 SCIS-educated schools showed that 72 percent of the students had reached higher grade A in Chinese, while 72 percent were German-speaking, 69 percent French, and 63 percent Spanish-speaking.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will no doubt need children and young people in the future.
Now languages are chosen as subjects in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education programs in independent schools and in other places.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission showed that 17 percent of the reasons why employers have had difficulty filling vacancies was due to a lack of language skills.
So more and more language skills become necessary to prepare young people for a future career.
With more promising jobs that require language awareness, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
And no matter who says a thing, if you learn another language, it will become the real advantage in the future if you're given that skills for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people of other countries automatically puts multiple people first among the competitors.
In an interview with YouuGov, in which over 4,000 adults participated, 75 percent of them were unable to speak another language properly enough to speak, and French was the only language where a double-digit percentage was spoken -15 percent.
That's why teaching investments in language are now important for modern children.
The presence of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more chance to find a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be divided according to the languages that it teaches.
Schools are focusing on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages which are considered to be most important in the UK's view of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child is, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with a teaching staff, which is a specialist in the field.
Scotch Independent Schools seek to provide an environment of education that will cook children and empower them with the skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds.
Currently you cannot deny that in the global business environment language is still vital to the future of the country so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as "the skills of international relations."
Independent schools will further suggest this choice, variety and preference for kids of Scotland.
It must be done
John Edward is director of the Scots Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron debuts for a Sunday in San Diego
Now start waiting for the followers who want to see LeBron James do their first start at Los Angeles.
"Lekers" coach Luke Walton announced that James was playing a pre-airly opening Sunday against Denver Naghts in San Diego.
But how many minutes it plays, we need to know more.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," stated Walton on the official Lakers website.
President Lakes Mike Trudel wrote that James is likely to be playing at restricted minutes.
According to the practice that had been done this week, James was asked about his plans for "Six of Picture pre-zone graphs."
"I don't need pre-zone games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Tremp time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
To-night at Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is starting a bunch of shares in the company.
This is the first of five planned TED Talks for the following week, including hibernations in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
Upon approval of voting on election to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to reinforce support for the pending interim elections, as the republics risk losing control over the Cigress when the voices are put into November.
When does Trumpe's talk tonight in West Virginia, and how do you look at it on the internet?
Tramp's talk at Willing, West Virginia, scheduled to take 7 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's talk in West Virginia on the internet below on YouTube straight line.
Trump is probably this week to consider stand-in hearings at the Breta Cavanao High Court, which has problems with accusing people of sexual harassment with expected warrants in the Senate of voting for a week during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these talks is to help republicans who are standing before the November election.
So the Trump's campaign announced that the five speakers for the following week were aimed at "enacting activities of volunteers and followers so the Republics are trying to protect and extend the majority that they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," reports the Reuters.
"The country's execution is so important to him in the order of the day, that the president is leaving at a very large number of states, as we come into the busy season of the front-run company," stated Reuters, a representative of the Trump Company.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena's Arena in Willing, today's action may attract followers from Agayo and Pennsylvania and draw attention to Pizzburg media," reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visited West Virginia, the state that he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help an applicant in the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the polls.
'That's not a very good sign for Morris, that the President must come to try to give him a jolt in the polls,' said Simon Hedar, a politicalologist from the University of West Virginia, notified Reuters.
Rieder Cup 2018: The US team continues to fight to keep hopes of a resurrection a Sunday
After three one-sided sessions four Saturday perhaps, exactly what you need for this Rieder Cup.
The ping mat, what's happening is a completely curated and collaborative concept, where those players really believe in something and nothing more than that, if you like it.
So where would they say the ping now?
"They had an advantage with six points, and now they're four, so I think we're passing it over with a little ping," said Jordan Sleeping, stepping through the day.
The edge of Europe is of course four points ahead, and the game is twelve more.
Americans, as askance says, feel that they have slightly blown the wind, and they have at what to hope, not least because of the form of Sleep and Justin Thomas, who were playing together all day, and each one could brag three points with four.
Sleep was deadly from T-shirts to greens and is an example.
These guttural screams of the celebration were getting louder and louder as his round went on, and he held a decisive blow to play in the match on the four fields when they and Thomas came in two by two.
His stab that allowed them to win the match for the 15th was met with a similar cry, just like that one tells you that he considered the American team turned on.
"You just have to go into it and worry about your own match," said the Spice.
Already each of these players is gone.
18 holes to do the answer.
In the last two days, the only players that have gained more points than Spate and Thomas are the French Malinars and Tommy Fleetwood, the ridiculous story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couples in Europe are four and four and can't do anything wrong.
"Malewood" were the only couple who had not made a god on Saturday afternoon, but they also ran off the gods on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, and on the afternoon afternoon.
It happens, and how their energy seems to flow before and from this tumultuous crowd, and it argues that they are players that win the Sunday, and there would be more popular players to shut down a potential victory in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleet or Malinars.
Wished both at the same time by different holes.
The conversation about European glory remains untimely.
Boubb Watson and Web Simpson did a short work on Sergio Garcia, a hero of the early furchette when he was in couple with Alex Norren.
The gods and two twins on the fore nine dug up a Spanish and a Swedish he they never got away from.
And for the Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
On a match of four balls and four are so interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they're giving, the advice they're not performing, and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has thus far become a better team and taken on a significant role on the last day, but at this fourth meeting the United States team also indicates that it is seeking to combat a fight in which some have been doubted, particularly in the United States.
Europe Comes into the Final of the Rider Cup with a number of 10-6
Europe will get a good advantage on the last day of the Riedder Cup after the four balls and the four will come out of the Sabbath with advantage from 10-6 over the states.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and the French Molinars set the stage to fight the two winners over Tiger Woods to take stock at Le Golf National up to four.
The European side of Thomas Byrn, trying to keep the trepidation that they had lost in Hazelcin two years ago, reigned at the U.S. office of Dissatisfaction, received the series 3-1.
The United States offered more match for the match of four balls, two games won, but they were unable to do more.
You need an eight-in-one match for a Sunday to save in order to do so.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row, and he's also a Malinard who got the name Molliwood after a sensational weekend. It's only the second pair that won four points in his first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Having broken Woods and Patrick Read into four balls, they were admirably braced to defeat the empty Woods and the American recruit Brian Decomb yet five and four more.
Woods, who held himself after two games on Saturday, showed a random splash of glitter, but now he was lost 19 out of 29 times in match with four balls and four and seven in a row.
Justin Rowes, who was resting on his list of four balls, went back to his partner Henrik Stanson in the match of four balls to phase 2 & 1 Destiny Johnson and Brooks Catpes, taking one and the other place in the world.
Europe had no its way, though it was a pleasant, fresh day south of west Paris.
On Saturday the third major winner, Jordan Spat and Justin Thomas, set the point for Americans to two.
They won the game 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter from Spain during the match-up of four balls and returned later to beat Puller and Rory McAnd 3 in the four, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did the team come back from a four-point deficit, which starts alone, although it takes the owner of Furick to draw to keep the trophie safe.
However, after the next two days, what was best, the countermeasure for the Sunday looks as if they could all be out on it.
North Korea says that "no way" will be disarmed in a single-sided manner without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated that on Saturday the United Nations continues to issue a single-sided sanction which would increase confidence in the United States, and in such circumstances the country can not give up nuclear weapons.
Ry Yun Ho stated at the annual General Assembly of the World that last year North Korea took "significant good will measures", such as stopping trials at nuclear and missile sites, de-posing of nuclear trials and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Unless we see the appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"No trust in the US will be placed in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no first way in single-sided disarmament."
In spite of the fact that Ri had republished North Korean national complaints against Washington's "phased" approach to diffusion, within which North Korea was rewarded because she was taking incremental steps, his application turned out to be significant in that it did not deny a single-sided notification of denuclearization that had been done by the Peanians in the past.
Ri referred to the issued statement by Kim Cheng Ein and Donald Trump at the first in the history of the U.S. President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim fellows were working on the path to "the popularization of the Korean peninsula" in this trip promise to give a security guarantee to North Korea.
The North would have wanted to end the war in Korea formally from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States said that it would have to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington was also supported by the call to cancel the strict international sanctions concerning North Korea.
"The United States of America has first insisted on "declaration" and on increasing the pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose forcibly, and has even spoken against "declaration of the end of the war," says Ri.
"The notion that sanctions can put us on our knees is an unprecedented dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention any plans for the second stand between Kim and Trump, which the US head mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Carey Moon Je-in in the last five months and added, "If South Korea had been a participant in the denuclearization issue, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have become so stupid."
However, the tone of the Ri Ree's speech changed sharply from that of the previous year when he spoke to the U.S.A., when the General Assembly stated that the targeting of the US contingent with North Korea rockets was imminent after the "Mr. President of the Wicked" Trump called the "Rocket" suicide.
This year at AN Trump, which last year had threatened to destroy North Korea, commended Kim for his courage in taking action on the issue, but said that there would be a lot of work to be done and the sanctions must remain in force till that couple were denuclearized by the North.
He didn't have a time frame for that, and he said, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia both argue in the AU. The Security Council said it's worth commending Pian for the measures it's taken.
However, the U.S. secretary, Mike Pampera, told Satan about the security of the ANN on Thursday that "The execution of sanctions by Satan's Security needs to be actively and necessarily continued until we are fully, permanently, and truly denuclearized."
The Soviet Security Council strengthened sanctions for North Korea in 2006 to stop funding nuclear and ballistic rocket programs in Peanias.
Pampé met with Ri in Sweet Security's calories. The General Assembly then said that the next month he would visit the Pingen again to prepare for the next summit.
Pampe had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip had failed.
In cast, he left Pianca, stating that the progress achieved with North Korea for hours at a time had ended his statement that he proclaimed the requirements "like that of gangs".
To meet Muna this month, North Korea has promised to liquidate the rocket installation and the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
Trump said that, as Kim said, "appropriate measures" which he expects is a guarantee of security and an attempt to normalize relations with Washington, D.C., that Trump promised Singapore.
Harvard students take a proper rest course.
The new course at Harvard University this year has to teach students more sleep, and has a goal in struggling with a culture of learning the night with coffee in their hands.
And he concluded that students in one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to look after themselves and their health.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham Hospital and the Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first one in the U.S. history.
Inspired by the speech about the influence of sleep on learning, he started the course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why have they told me this just now, in the last lesson?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep; it was me surprised," he said to The Telegraph.
This is the first time this year that a student's course will explain why good sleep habits promote academic and sporting achievement, and also improve overall moods.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and curator at the University, said that the university decided to teach him after it found that students were often deprived of sleep for a week.
This course, which lasted an hour, includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, we have a picture of a room on the Internet where students press cups of coffee, curtains and books about the influence of coffee and light and how the lack of sleep works up social performance as well as the importance of the habit in front of their sleep.
On the run-up stage, participants are told how the multiple years' sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A compass map, with interactive images, encourages participants to think about their everyday life.
"We know it doesn't change the student's behavior instantly.
But we think they should know it as well as everybody else knows about the health consequences of smoking," added Professor Chaisler.
He said that a culture of night evenings still exists, adding that modern technology, and constantly increasing pressure on students, can reduce sleep, making it a growing problem.
"Supplied good-quality sleep must be a students' secret weapon" to fight stress, reduction and anxiety," he said, "even to avoid unnecessary weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student, who was involved in chemical and physical biology, assisted in the development of the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to examine all on the computer.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all students to complete a similar training program before going to university.
Professor Chaisler recommended that the student should set up an hour to know if to go to bed and when to wake up in aware of the damaging consequences of the "black light" being emitted from the monitors and lightbulbs, which could change the daily mode, resulting in a sleep problem.
Livingstan 1:0 Rangers: Menga kills naked Gerard.
We'd heard that the Rangers didn't get one more chance. (Laughter) When Dolly Mangi's goal made sure that Stephen Jarard wouldn't get one more time on Lorvingston.
Ibrax wants to keep his first victory on the path to a triumph with a number 4-1 in February in St. John's, but Gary Holtan's team has already carried the second parading of Jarardus as a manager of 18 games to leave his side of the eight points behind, following the leader of the Ladbrokes stage.
Manga hit seven minutes to stop, and the Rangers team, inspired by a goal, didn't look like it was pulling a paralysis.
And while the Rangers come down to their sixth place, theatingston took their third place, and behind them are the Hiberniani, with the difference in the balls.
For the Rangers there may be additional problems after the ford Kalum Spence has to sally out of his May head after he has hit the thing thrown down with the trebes.
Jarard made eight changes to players that Ira had never played in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livia under the 11 numbers that had allowed her to pick the point from Harts last week, and was delighted to see how well they went at every step of their opponents.
The Rangers had more control over the ball, but Lithuania had more attempts at killing the ball.
They had to kill already in two minutes, when the first time that Mengi directed a ball through the Scott Pitman to the gate of Alan McGregar, and then the hunter used that chance.
backed by the fine punch Jacobs Keagan carried the photograph of Craig Hallett, but his Alan Letg's protect partner managed to bear a strong blow from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game, they had more chance of killing than they had of playing a good game.
Alfred Marelas was certainly to be punished with a fine of a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Lawrence came together in the field, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept the complaint of Columbia.
Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but the former Ibrox Leam Callie Brod about to give up Hol Lassana Coulibali and the effective sportsman Ovi Ekharya.
Though striking the first goal at 34 minutes Left may have been against the further active game, but no one deny that they must exhibit a good game's winner.
Once again, Rangers failed to break Jacobs' gate.
Scott Arfield didn't answer when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Mengu for the opportunity of being killed in a gate.
Jarard was replaced by a duel by a Ryan Kent, and that turned out to be an effective force when his attack hit Marelas but an impressive Calli came running and locked the punch.
But Liwingstan continued to meet visitors playing that game, which they liked, and Litgaws and Hulkt continued to split the ball after a long contrast.
Box Holt was able to prevail in the last few minutes only, but McGregar was playing well to stand up against Jacobs before the Lithuanias went to the back of the bench.
The replacement of Rajers Glenn Midltan took place regularly after the penalty was fined, when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson succeeded in curing.
Almanach: The inventor of Geiger's counter.
And this is a page from our almanac for the "Sun morning" 30th of September, 1882, 136 years ago, and PADLIK -- the day of the future physics of Ivan Wilhelm Heiger's "Hangs" who was born in Germany.
Geiger's design of a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which resulted in a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter became a part of science and appeared in pop culture as in the 1950 film entitled "The Call of the Koran," in which those apparently unknown scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans took part.
Who is he on earth?
Rogers: 'It's the Geiger counter, which is used to find radical minerals, like uranium.
If you're earmarking, you're actually able to hear sounds of atoms that give up radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: 'Say, is it really cracking now?'
Hans Geiger died in 1945 just a few days before his birth.
But the inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
New progressionocyst can help the immune system watch cancer cells.
New anti-narcotics resolution can help you view the immune system as bad cells and destroy them.
It's like the learning of the immune system to recognize bad cells that are part of the cure.
The method involves getting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory.
Then cells can see the squirrels spread in many cancer cells and then reenter the helper cells.
A test screen shows successful results for patients with different kinds of cancer.
One woman who was introduced into a station that helped the immune system recognize cancer cells saw ovarian cancer disappear for 18 months.
And the method includes getting immune cells into the patient, changing them into a laboratory, so they can see the HER2 squirrels as common to many cancer cells, and then re-entering.
This is what Professor Jay Berzophsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer at Bethes State of Maryland said, but our results show that there's a very promising job.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several species of anti-racous cells that fight with lung cancer, grubs, lungs and thick cats," said Professor Berazofsky.
And it's the same approach to finding immune cells in patients -- and learning them -- to reach out to cancer cells that worked really well for leukemia.
Kanye West started a discussion in support of Trump, carrying the title of the MAG, after his appearance in the SlL.
That didn't turn out well.
In the studio during the Saturday night, Kanye West was released after the talk where he was praising the US. The president, Donald Trump, said he would run for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song, called "The City-Inspect," in the cap of "Let's Do America Again Great," he spoke against the democrats and affirmed his support for the Trumpet.
"How many times I talk to the whites, and they were like, 'How can you support Trumpe, it's growing?"
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America for a long time," he said.
So SlL began with a main role for Matt Daeman, where a Hollywood star dealt with the testimony of Bret Kavano in front of the Senate court during the proceedings concerning Cristina Blace Ford's sexual assault.
Despite the fact that the performance was not broadcast, West's words fell in the frame and were loaded into social media comedian Chris Rock.
I didn't know whether Rock was trying to get away from West.
Besides, West complained to the public that he had a hard time round his chairs.
They fancied at me behind the chairs.
They were like, "Don't go out there with that hat.
They bedded on me.
"And then they say I'm in a giddy place," he said as reported by the newspaper the Washington Examer.
West went on, "Do you want to see the doom of the place?' "'Speak that he is' put on,' said Scperman, what meant he couldn't tell me what to do.
Try to love.
Because of his statement, at least twice the hearings were shut down, and the representatives of the SNA were puzzled by the message from Verita -- "The whole studio fell silent."
West was taken as the substitute for Aryan Grande's singer, whose was a fellow, Riple MacMiller, had died a few days ago.
West surprised many a performance of the I Love It, dressed in a bottle of water perrier.
West received support from the head of the Canned Party of TPUS, Candez Turner, who wrote in Twitter, "One of the most brave spirits thank you for your support."
But knowing the point-show Karen Hunter wrote that West is just the one he is and it's always wonderful.
"But I decided NOT to reward anybody by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art" that I believe embraces and disqualifys the ideology that is damaging to my covet.
He's free.
'As well as we are,' she added.
Before the show he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "officially called Keyney West."
He wasn't the first artist to change his name, and went after the old lady's tracks, also known as Puff Grandpa.
His knee-roper is called Snoop Dogg's location and certainly the legend of music that changed his name into a symbol and then he and the artist, formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted murder at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of trying to kill after a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast when a second man was attacked in Friday.
The incident happened in Balíchamor like the report to the police.
The accused is expected to appear on Monday in the Belfast Court.
The prosecution will be considered by the State Prosecutor's Office.
Keith Harington's Star of the Game Throne has gripped idealized brutality.
Whale Harington is known for his swinging sword and for the role of John Snow in the "The Gould Ghost" series of the medieval raw HBO
But the 31-year-old actor got the stereotype of a hero macho, which means that young boys often feel more strict for respect.
Speaking in the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought something had happened and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
A whale who had recently married his neighbor on the Gollie thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted to being able to solve this problem.
"Do I feel personally strong--if we have been wrong with courage?" he said.
"Why do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the attitude which we see now?"
Someone thinks television should be responsible for showing up because of very male figures.
He continued: “What is at the beginning, and why is this student?
Why do we teach on TV and in the street that makes young boys feel that they must be so sure to be a real person?
I think that's really one of the biggest questions in our time -- how will we change it?
Because it's obvious that something happens to young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that the next summer the serial would end, and he would come out of the field of a serial battle and not make a dock or a stick for the Play Thrones.
As of November, the whale will begin to re-establish the real Western Sam Shepherd, who is a historical director with his brothers who is a robber.
We just had a couple of stories recently that we considered to have met Rose's wife as the best opportunity to finish the "King of Thrones".
'I've met my wife in this serial, so I've got my family to be and my life's here,' he said.
The pink game was played by Ygritte, a personage whose favorite hero is Keith John Snow in this imaginary serial blessed "Ami."
And the couple sat down in June of 2018 in the village of Leslie in Scotland.
HlV / AIDS: China reports new cases by 14%
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HlV and AIDS has increased by 14 percent.
According to the information of the health workers, more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were recorded.
The vast majority of new cases were passed through sex as it was in the past.
Traditional HlV infection is spreading in some districts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
"Well, the number of people who got HlV-infection through blood transfusions has dropped to almost zero," said the Chinese officials at the conference held in the province of June.
But every year, the number of people living with HlV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000.
The transmission of HlV infection through sex is a acute problem of China's LGBT-Sulk.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT-like people until now.
Because of the conservative value of the country, there are 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men and the end result is that they will marry women.
Many diseases are spread from lack of knowledge and sexual contractation.
Since 2003, the government of China has universal access to HlV-related drugs as part of its efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Vaters denies the fiends of the added, threatened and theory of her employees' plot of parliament
The United States ofcoreswuman Maxine Watts scurryed on Saturday an prosecution- -that its member published some personal information about the three U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages.
The democrat of LA- -states that the claim is for the top right wing members and their websites.
"false, false, and much detestable lies," said Waters' statement on Twitter.
The information published, as reported, includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States. contributed by Lindsey Graham of South Queen and Mike Lee and Oryn Hatch, both of Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on the Capital Hill during the senate commission hearing on charges of sexual harassment against a member of the Breta Cavanaugh High Court showed up on the internet on Thursday.
A fugitive took place some time after the three senators had asked Cavanaugh.
"Conservative sites such as Gatey Pundit and RedState report that the IP address of the source was associated with Waters' office and shared information with a member of the Waters team," says Hill.
"It's an unreasonable claim to be completely false and absolutely false," continued Waters.
"The members of my team, whose data, personal information and security were compromised by these Ashuk and false accusations, were never again responsible for the leaking of this information.
It's an unreasonable assertion that it's completely false and absolutely false."
The Vaters' statement quickly raised a lot of criticism on the internet, including that of the former White Czar of Ara Fleicher House.
"It's a denial of anger," wrote Flasher.
This means that she doesn't have the courage to be a member of Congrance.
If someone is accused of not doing that, they don't have to be angry.
They don't have to act indignant.
They shouldn't question the motives of their charges.
They must be calm and good- natured.
The hunter compared the Vaters' reaction to a crisis of democrats before Judge Covano when they were accused of being too angry during the hearings on Thursday.
Amar Nawara, a candidate for a Republican party that talk about and participates in elections and elections, also stated on Twitter.
"It's a picture if it turns out right," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters stated that her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false claims.
"We guarantee that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and they will take legal responsibility for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any of the members of my team."
A look at Johnny English Strikes Again strikes an imaginary spy named Rowan Atkinsana.
Now it's become tradition to look for the meaning of BRECKS in any new British-roofed film, and the oblivion appears to have been in comedy and acting Frances by Johnny Ingles, which started with Johnny Ingles as early as 2003 and lasted on in 2011 under the name of the renaissance of Johnny Ingles.
Can the satar well express how obvious we are when we're talking about new export possibilities?
In every instance, the second time he appeared on the printed page, the uncompetential Johnny Ingles got the opportunity to row over things--his name was more loud than all the comic creatures that he had made for the non-English spectators in the cinema.
Of course he's a secret agent, who, in spite of their strange claims to glomur, has become a little like Cluso with Mr. Bin and a little taco boy who brought the only note to the Chore of the fire at the lemon opening of the Alimpida in London in 2012.
Originally his personages were based on the traveller and the international mysteries of Atkins, who once played the forgotten Barclayard, leaving chaos in his way.
And here are a couple of nice things that have not happened before.
I liked Johnny Ingles, who is approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the mouth of the rotter a little knocks on his helmet.
The gift of Atkinsan for Theatre comedy is shiningly demonstrated, but the humour feels weak, and so it's strangely particular when serious movies, such as "Army 007: Mission inexorable" make sure that comedy is offered as a main feature.
Humour feels as if it's not just for the grown-ups, but for the kids as well, and even the stupid accidents of Johnny Inglesch aren't as resourceful as the silent movies of Atkinsan in the face of Bina.
A long-standing, long-standing, thoughtful problem is the serious problems of the United Kingdom.
A cyber-hacker nobody in the UK's super-secret community of British spies having discovered the names of all British agents in their seats, to the disappointment of the military agent, that's unfortunately the small role of Kevin Eldan.
This is the last glimpse for a Prime Minister who is a proud and mixed young man who is already suffering from political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible with that quasi-Terezay-May, but the script has nothing like that.
Her intelligence advisers report that since each true spy will be revealed, she's going to have to be activated by some of those who've already retired.
And that means you know, for Johnny Inglech's own sake, it gets more complicated because it's now working as the sixth teacher in a couple of neck institutions and it gives lessons on how to be a covered operator: some good examples here, because the Inge into this Academy of Music is offering a tutoring lesson.
Inglesz came back to Whitehol for an extra bruffing and connected with his former long friend Bo, who is playing again with Ben Miller.
Nowadays Bo hath my marriage bound to a submarine's commander, whose role Vicky Pepper carried out a little vain.
In this way Batman and Robin get terribly wrong things at the Queen's secret office, where they work again, meeting the beautiful female Wounding.
Meanwhile, the prime minister receives a dangerous command from a confidential technical billionaire that says he can solve problems with UK hackers: James Wilson, who is played by jake Lacey.
Ingles and Boe begin their work with immediate things: to disguise as a waiter, to set fire to a French restaurant; to create a threat, to combat smugglers on board the luxurious Volta boat; and to act as if he were doing pure anarchy, because he was trying to use a family of virtual reality to learn from the engineer of Volta's house.
All the moments took up for the last event, but equally pleasant and boisterous, with a pretty many children on TV.
Quite the good stuff.
And how about other movies about Johnny Inglech? I couldn't even think, "Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinsan a role that really demonstrates his talent?"
The Liberia Party refuses to have a plan to pay the British for a four-day work week with a payment of five days.
The working party, Jeremy Corbina, has to consider a radical plan, if the British only work four days a week, but they're paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company managers to convey the labor results of what has been done as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence by giving them an extra day off.
It was like that staff members to build up a three-day weekend, but they still get the same payout.
And so the source notes that this idea represents the economics of the party and is going to fix the country in order to support workers.
The place of the tradesmen was praising the transition for a four-hour week as a good way to take advantage of a change in economy.
The oldest source in the Labour Party said to the magazine The Sunday Times: "A plan of action will be announced by the end of the year.
It's not going to happen now, but a four-day work week is an idea which corresponds to what's happening in the party and the overall industrial strategy for regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Liberia Party wasn't the first to support an idea like this. The Green Party promises to spend a four-day work week in general elections in 2017.
However, the aspirations of the Labaric Party are not generally supported.
The Leiberate Party said, "The fourth week of the week is not a party- -that is not a party- -and it is not viewed by the party.
Chancellor John MacDonel used a working conference last week to express his view of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonel said he was determined to get control back from the "free directors" and the "mangers" into the comical industry.
The valuable chancellor's plans also foresee that the present water shareholder can fail to get back the whole package of shares, because the Liberist government can do the calculation on the basis of alleged abuses.
He also said that it was planned to make the jobs part of the company's reports and create a pool of ownership funds in order to hand over 10 percent of his own private firm to workers who would hold annual dividends up to 500 pounds sterling.
Lindsay Graham, John Kenedi is told for "60 Minutes," that the watcher of the FBI, working with Covano, should change his mind
An investigation of the FBI into charges relating to Judge Bret Kavano has been reserved for a final vote on his expulsion to the Supreme Court at least a week. The question remains whether the office of the Republic Senators can render a support vote.
Scott Pelee was asked by the republicists, Johnny Candi and Lindsay Graham about "Sens" Sunday, if the FBI can reveal anything that could bring about change.
Canadians turned out to be more open than his colleagues from South Queen.
"I mean, of course," said Kandi.
"I said, going to the courthouse: I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after this happened and I asked him about the reason for the prosecution and said, "Did you do that?"
He was resolute and unambiguous."
The grema's idea, however, seems finished.
"I think that Bret Cavano has decided that it will be a scandalous accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Bret firmly denies it," added Graham, referring to Chris Blaze Ford.
"And anyone she called could not believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I can't see anything new."
What is the International Festival of Citizens, and what is done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday's International Festival: The annual musical event, which has a very exciting composition of speakers and performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Civil Festival will be held in a large meadow of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendez's concert and to learn about the real purpose of ending poverty and staying there until 2030.
The international festival of citizenship that began in 2012 is the continuation of a global project against the play of an international propaganda group that is expected to end poverty through an increase in the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
So in order to get a free ticket at the event (if you don't want to pay the VIP ticket) that visitor had to do a number of tasks or " had to do a share", be a volunteer, email the leader of the country, call any other child and raise awareness about the purpose of ending poverty.
But how successful was the public festival for 12 years and could it achieve its purpose?
Is it about giving people a free concert with a real way to convince people that they need to take action, or is this just another case of so-called "clictivism" -- people feel they're doing good work by signing online petitions or tweeting?
Since 2011, organizers of the festival have announced that they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters trying to achieve different goals.
They say that these actions helped push influential leaders to make commitments on the account of over 37 billion dollars that could affect more than 2.25 billion people by the 2030s.
At the beginning of 2018, the group came up with 390 comments on duties and stated at least 10 billion dollars that had already been allocated or collected.
In the evaluation of the group, provided resources so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnership with investors and performers based in the UK, "help the children develop into a full volume", and a promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million in order to help prevent poverty in the country from becoming a part of the world after having received more than 4,700 tweets from citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of various countries we can eradicate social injustice in the history," stated the ambassador Tracy Ulman of London in April 2018.
Furthermore, the group reported that after more than 5,000 actions had been taken in the United Kingdom to improve food for mothers and children, the Government had announced a funding project that reached 5 million women and children with food problems.
In answer to one of the frequent questions on the site, what makes you think we can end poverty?
The global festival answered, "That'll be a long and hard way, sometimes we'll be patient with a failure and a failure.
But like the great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we will achieve success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Wickand, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Janel Monae is one of the top few people who are acting at an event this year in New York City that will be led by Deborah-Lee Francis and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy for a "blockade" to prevent the export of Russian oil and gas
"Washington may, if necessary, address the Navy to prevent Russian power from getting out on the EZ and the Middle East markets," stated U.S. secretary Ryan Zenck, notified by Washington Examer.
He argued that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular where it acts upon the invitation of a legal government, are the basis for the study of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they stay in the Middle East is that they want to acquire energy just as they do in Eastern Europe and south Europe," he said.
And, it's true that there are ways and means to do it.
"The United States is able, with the help of the Navy, to assure the openness of the sea-paths, and if necessary, to arrange the ice so that their energy doesn't hit the market," said he.
And she spoke to the members of the company organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers- -a non-profit group that stands for themselves as the head of energy consumers in the U.S.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, remarking that they were essentially the same.
"The economic Alternative on Iran and Russia is more or less equal to and replaces fuel," he said, calling Russia the "one-sided country" with an economy which is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements appeared at a time when the Trump administration wanted to significantly increase the export of its blotish natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump's employees, including the US president, Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to quit the "false" North Stream 2 gas project, which Trumpa agreed to turn Berlin into a "Found" Moscow.
The mask repeatedly suggests that the North 2 gas distribution, which is about 11 billion dollars that are created to drive the existing gas fair to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
The dock says that Washington's stiff opposition to this project takes a start in the economy and is an example of an unconscionable competition.
"I believe that we have the only view that energy can't be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Alexander Nowk, after meeting with the U.S.
Americans got a stab in return from Germany, who once again confirmed her affection for the project.
The main German organization that represents the industry, the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) has called upon the U.S. not to interfere with EU energy policies and two-tail agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I've got a big problem here, when Third State intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss his participation in the 2020 presidential election very seriously, declared by the senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, declared on Saturday that he would seriously consider his participation in the elections of the President after the inter-election.
In a speech at the Mayor of Halíoki, Massachusetts, Warren stated that he was looking at the possibility of his being part of it.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and please our ineffective government, and I am also talking about women in the highest positions," she said, "The Hill."
"After 6 November, I shall seriously consider the opportunity to run for the presidency."
During a speech at Warren's Mayor, he bumped into President Donald Trump, saying that "the country is in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely worried about what Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren publicly criticized Trumpa and his candidate for the Breta Cavanaugh High Court.
On Friday, Warren wrote, "Surely, before voting need the FBI to conduct the investigation."
However, an inquiry published on Thursday showed that most voters of Warren didn't think it should run on the President in 2020.
Well, according to a survey by the University of Safalka/Bostan Globe, fifty-eight percent of the mighty voters of Massachusetts said that the senator should not stand out.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The poll showed great support for the former governor of Deval Patrick, where 38 percent was in charge and 48 percent against.
Other known names among the democrats discussed in connection with potential chattering in 2020 include the former vice president of Joe Byden and the senator of the state of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Per the terms of an Associated Press byden said that the official he would take a decision to January.
At one point in his support of Donald Trumper Sara Pallin mentioned a post-traumatic syndrome of Trek Paulna
The 26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after he was drafted into the palace.
On Monday evening he was arrested and he had been accused of domestic violence
"What my son comes through on his return, I can compare with the results of our post-bramatic syndrome and the injuries with which our soldiers come back, at other families," she said, assembled at a distance in support of Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Paulin called that arrest "the silent question" and said that her son, together with other veterans of the war "returns a little by others, tempered, returns with a question whether there is any respect that soldiers, pilots, other military personnel, may struggle for, giving themselves to a country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and he's been accused of domestic assault against a woman, preventing attempts to report domestic violence, our weapons intoxicating state, according to Dan Benet's information, by the secretary-in-law of the Vasil Police Department.
18 states and districts in Colombia support of the establishment of a new policy of accommodation
There are eighteen states and districts in Colombia who support an objection to a new US policy which denies victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
There are 18 states and districts in Colombia that have provided an analytical note on Friday in Washington, D.C. to support the establishment of shelter politics, reports the NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Ceschnes case, which was opened in August by the American Civil Rights Union against Federal Policy, was not discovered.
She said that her partner, "and his friends from a hard gang," had raped her, but the US authorities said that they had rejected her in the 19th of July.
She was detained in Texas.
Grace-supporting jurisdictions described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are the largest number of requests for shelter in the United States, like countries which have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American policy on asylum changed the 2014 decision of the Commission of Appeal concerning the immigration of immigrants without documents which are victims of domestic violence and who are victims of domestic violence.
General Prosecutor Carl Reysin of the Columbia District stated on Friday that the new politician "fucking for decades is a recent experience of states, countries and the world."
"Federal guarantee requires that applications for refuge were based on specific facts and circumstances, and such a change would disrupt this principle," said in an analytical note.
The lawyers also said in a note that politicians who deny immigrants make the U.S. economy worse by saying that often immigrants can be found entrepreneurs and "establish needed jobs."
Attorney-General Jeff Sachnes ordered that on June, immigration judges should no longer give asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"The connection is between one who leaves his country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political opinion," stated S Security on 11 June in announcing that policy.
The nature of this has never meant the solution to all the serious problems that everybody around the world has had to deal with every day.
Desperate rescue work in Palau. In trying to find the survivors, the number of victims has doubled.
The survivors are in a very difficult situation.
"It's all very tense," said Rice Kusum's 35-year-old mother, soothing his little son with the temperature at the evacuation centre of the destroyed city of Pal.
"Every minute the car fetches a body.
Pure water very little."
The lodgers began to go back to their destroyed houses, trying to figure out cloudy things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were wounded and hospitals damaged by magnetic land-mines 7.5 points were filled.
Some of the wounded, including two Harris, who have broken the vertebrae and shoulder, are outside the army hospital of Pal, where patients lie in the street because of the strong jolts that repeat it.
In his eyes there were tears when he agreed to a strong underground jolt in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was time to cheer.
I'm stuck under the ruins of the wall," said Harris Asociated Press, and added that his family had come into town to marry.
"I heard my wife call out for help, but then for silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Passe blames China for the threats using "propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published four-page ads in American that book, praising the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the American building in China blamed Beijing for using the American press for spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned it in the past Wednesday that China Daily added to the Des Moines Register – the most widely sold gas source in the State of Avaia – after accused China of trying to intervene in the American Congres elections of November 6th. This is the charge China has announced.
blameing for the Trump that China had to intervene in American elections- -said what American officials say is that they're getting into a conversation with Reuters for a new phase in Washington, D.C. under pressure in China.
Although the placeing of advertising to foreign governments is normally the practice for promoting trade, now Beijing and Washington were engaged in trade war, the result of which was the reciprocal imposition of fares on imports.
Recruiting fares, stated by American and Chinese experts, were introduced to code for such an exporter as those of the state of Avaia that support the Republic Trump.
Torri Branstead, a U.S. ambassador in China, and a former governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural goods in China, stated that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers, and businessmen.
China, he wrote of Brandstad in a Sunday afternoon's paper, "now redoubles his efforts by printing propaganda ads in our free press."
"Presenting its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branded.
"And if you look at the newspaper kiosks in Beijing, there you find not many voices against, and you won't see the actual reflection of other opinions which the Chinese might have at least a dangerous track in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the iron fifth Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers has given up on the offer" to print his article although he didn't call the newspaper.
The republics push women voters just before the mid-term elections out of Cavanaugh physics, warn analysts
While many well-known republics are defending the candidate for the position of high court Breta Kavano in front of several charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would get a blow in reply, especially from women, during the future mid-term elections.
The emotions around this were very strong, and most republics already show that they are willing to vote.
"This thing can't be recovered," said Grant Richard, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University, bound for an article in The Hill.
The characterist said he was not sure that the statement by Senator Jeff Flake (Arison) concerning the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm down the scattered voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow and November," stated Friday, "Carin Jean-Pierre, Chief Spokesman and National Press Secretary of the advanced MoveOn gas group from Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesting scandals were conducted by "Listuasia fast!" during the demonstration in the Hall of the Senate, when republics, controlling a legal comet, decided to put forward Kavano's Candor despite a statement by Dr. Cristina Blace Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and the motivation of democracy will be extremely great," stated St. Rotenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they're high enough and it's true.
But maybe even higher, especially among female voters in their seats and young voters, who are 18 to 29 years old, who don't like the President, but don't often speak."
Even before the open war of Ford, in which she carefully laid down her charges of being a candidate in the Supreme Court of Justice in sexual assault, analysts suggest that if the Republics insist that there may be a strong blow in return.
"To the Republic party this has become a bit of a mess," said Michael Style, who was the chairman of the National Committee of the Republic Party at the beginning of the past week, according to the NBC News.
"The word isn't just on a committee vote or a final vote or because it's whether Cavanaugh is spent at a position; it's about how the republics have dealt with it and how they turned up, by sight of a news channel by Gay Cecil, director of parliament USA, groups that help select democracies.
But it looks like the Americans were divided into questions of ford's or Cavanaugh's right, but for a little bit more about the latter.
New poll from Yougov shows that 41 percent of the Republic's presidents are probably or don't really trust the Ford statement, and 35 percent said they're probably not really sure about Cavanaugh.
Besides that, 38 percent said that they thought Covano might or might have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After a storm by Flake the FBI investigates the charges of the Ford and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Last week Ford made a statement under oath before the Juridical Chamber of the Senate, that Cavanaugh, when she was drunk, was pressed upon her at the age of 17.
Ramirez says the candidate to the Supreme Court showed her their genitals on a party when they were in Aile in the 1980s.
The origin of the global network is planning to start a new Internet to come up with the competition for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world-wide web, runs the startup that will be used for Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The last project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a campaign that is built on this Berners-Lee Solid open platform.
Solid allows users to select a storage place for this message and who has access to this information.
In an exclusive interview with Last Company Berners-Lee, that by creating Inrupt, he meant "dominance over the World."
'I need to do it now,' he said about the startup.
"It's a historical moment."
This software is using Solid technology to allow people to create their own Internet data store or POD.
So this can contain contact lists, mailing lists, calendars, fanatics and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Space all at once on one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal repository on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it 'personal reinforcement of potential using dates.'
And in the opinion of the executive director of John Bros, the idea of creating an Inrupt allows the company to bring together the resources, the process and the necessary skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, and the security platform that was bought by IBM, the few developers who are working on this project actually built on this project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications, using the Inrupt web site.
Brners-Lee said he and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make any changes if all their business models were instantly aligned.
'We are not asking their permission.'
In a Saturday afternoon asking questions about Medium Berners-Lee, the Inrupt mission "is to ensure commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new web that was created on Solid."
In 1994 Berners Lee transformed the internet into a new one, creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in promoting Internet neutrality.
Even if you run Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Up Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about a new era of network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Respecting a clergyman rewarded by Victoria's Cross in the First World War.
A single Church of England clergyman, rewarded by Victoria's Cross during the first World War as a member of the battle, was marked in his city after 100 years.
He was rewarded on September 29, 1918, for taking part in the attack under Belenglys and Leacur.
But four days later, he fell off the bullet to death of a sniper, and he never found out he had the highest British military reward.
On Saturday, in Rushden City, Northhamptanshire, his two grandchildren opened a memorial stone in the south.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "a very symbolic" that the stone was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather had been rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vane's pilot led his battalion through the de San Quentin Canal "through a dense impala and under a strong rifle and machine-gun fire."
Then he ran up the line of fire and " with great boldness" led the soldier forward, self-captureing a gun and whacking out three representations.
The Van fireman was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little over a month later the war was over.
72 years old, Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "nothing that I never would have been able to do and also had something worthy of honor."
And he and his brother, Dr. James Van, too, sounded a wreath after the council which marked the Imperial Young Archbishop of Brandwood.
Michael Van said it was "for him the great honour to participate in the plus" and he added that "the man of the real hero was demonstrated by the support that many have."
MMA fans for an entire night were expected to watch Bellator 206; they instead got the lead of Pep
Just imagine you stood up all night to watch an reasonable broadcast from Bellator 206 and then you were denied to watch the main event.
There were 13 fights in a san Hazee program, including six on the main card, and they were shown on the direct air all night on the British TV channel 5.
And then, on the sixth morning, when Gérard Musassi and Rory MacDonald were cooking for competition, watching the UK simply rustling when the program changed to lead by Pepa.
Some were disappointed after the sleepy night, especially waiting for this fight.
One of the Twitter players called Twitter switching up on a kidie like "something stupid".
In response to a question about broadcast broadcasting, Dave Schwarz, chief vice president of Bellator on marketing and communication, said, "Well, according to the government's position and on 6 a.m., this was an inappropriate content and had to be switched to a children's program."
"Yes, Lead Pep."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker stated that in the future they would work on a program to take into account British spectators.
"The person we're arguing about is, I think, the possibility of repeating it, we can solve this question," said Coker.
"But now it's six o'clock Sunday, and we're not able to solve it till Sunday, and it's Monday over time.
But we are doing the best we can.
Believe me, when the programs changed we got so many messages and not all were friendly.
And we tried to solve that question -- I think it's a technical problem.
But this turns out to be a state policy.
But the next time you wish, you won't have to.
We will cut down the amount of prizes from six to five, as we do usually; this time we wanted to counsel the fountains, but we were obsolete.
It's all falling back to a situation."
"Discus of a Manless Island": Tom Daley felt "unimportant" because of his sexuality.
The Olympic squire on water to Tom Daley said it was growing up with a sense of uncertainty for others because of their sexuality- -but that gave him motivation on the road to success.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize that "not all like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking in the "Discus of the Unpeople's Island" programme, Radio 4 in the homely Laurent Laverne, he said he supported the rights of gays to give other "hope."
He also said that if he had a child he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional lead of this pretty old Kirsty Young program, taking a few months' rest because of illness.
As the man who found himself on the heartless island at the first program, Davey said that when he was a kid, he felt like he was less than anyone else because he didn't like people who liked boys and girls alike.
He said, "I still believe that this feeling of something that you're not as small as anything and small was what gave me power and inspiration for success."
He wanted to prove that he was "to somebody," he said, so that he wouldn't despair of those who had learned about his sexuality.
The two-fold bronze puzzle of the Olympics became a significant activist of the LGBT movement, and at the Australian Parliamentary Games of Australia this year urged the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he had expressed his opinion because he was fortunate to live openly, without persecution, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-way champion of the world said that when I fell in love with man -- American scripts, directors and presidents Dassine Lance Black, who met in 2013 -- it was a surprise for me.
Dale married Oscar's owner, who is 20 years older than he was last year, but he said that the difference at age doesn't matter.
"When you pass that sort of thing at such a young age"-- at the first Olympic he found himself in the age of 14 years, and three more years later his father died of cancer--he said it was hard to find a distributed who would survive such flight and fall.
In June they became parents, their son's name was Robert Ray Black-Dailey, and Dale said his " had changed completely" prospects.
"If you had asked me last year, I would tell you that I need to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, the world has something more important than the gold Olympic medal.
Do it is my golden Olympic medal."
His son also called his father, Robert, died in 2011 at the age of 40 years from brain cancer.
Dale said that the father didn't take the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked were whether they had bought tickets to the London Olympics of 2012- -he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't sit in first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not immortal," said he.
Next year, Daley competed in 2012 and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life--to jump into the water in front of my talkers at the Olympic Games, that's the best feeling," he said.
This also affected a song chooser -- Proud from Heather Smol -- which he found in it a feedback in preparation for the animid and from which the ants are now running.

Michaelson, who is not fit, remains on the bench reserve at Ryder's cup Saturday.
American Phil Michaelson putting a high score on Sunday by playing his 47th match in the Ryder cup, but he has to get his form back so that it doesn't turn out to be an unhappy event.
Michaelsson, who will play in this competition, which is to be held every two years, was celebrated by the 12th time, the Captain of the team Jim Fürke planted on a bench reserved for Saturday indulging in.
Rather than be in the center of events, as he was there often for the United States team, the five-time winner of the cup shared his days between work of cheerleader and training, as he came back into shape.
Even on the corner of his career, he wasn't the best player, and now a 48-year-old golf player is not the ideal solution for the hard field of Le Golf National, where severe blows are being punished.
And if the field itself is not bleak enough, Michaelson, in the fourth match for the Sunday, will fight against the exact British Open French Melinard champion who, together with Tommy Flitwood, won all four games this week.
When Americans miss their four points on the order of 12 single games, you start off with success, then the match for Michaelsson may turn out to be extremely important.
reak expressed confidence in this player, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood his role today, crushed me on the back, attracted and said he'll be ready tomorrow," said Fürke.
"He's very sure of himself.
He was taken to the Hall of Fame and gave very much to the teams last week and this week.
Perhaps I didn't plan it for two games.
I planned more, but it worked like this and we thought to play.
He wants to be on the field, as well as all the others."
Michaelson will break the high score of Nick Fald by the number of matchers in the Rieder cup played on a Sunday.
It can be the end of a career in a Rieder cup which was never the same as having to do with individual games.
In Michaelson's 18 wins, 20 wins, and seven sticks, although Furyk said that his presence had brought a team of benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with humour, likes to fire at people and just really good man, who's good to have on his team," he explained.
"I believe that the more young players gladly parched his jests, too, this week, and it was a good thing to see.
He gives the team a lot more than a game."
The Captain of the European Team, Thomas Byrne, knows that a great tear can soon disappear
Thomas Bjourn, the captain of the European team, knows with experience that a significant break before the individual games of the last day on a Ryder cup can easily disappear.
The Danish player debuted the 1997 match in Walden, where a European team, led by Seva Balesteras, took advantage of five items over Americans, but concluded with minimal advantage 141⁄2-1312.
"You will always remember, in Walden, that we had a great advantage and a victory, but difficultly, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost," said Bjorn, after watching the team of Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, and dropped it with the number 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"History shows me and everyone else in the team that it's not yet the end.
Tomorrow we need to play all hundred.
Check this box to add and remove words to the entry field.
Till points appeared in the table, ain't nothing finished.
That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to win the mark, and we're going to focus on that.
I'm always saying this, and I'm focusing on 12 players on us, but we know very well that the opposite side is the best players in the world."
"I'll never count myself on it. I'm not going to lose it."
There's another game going to be tomorrow.
And that's something else, that's an individual game, right?
Just be cool, when you're in the field with your partner and everything's fine, but when you're playing alone, your real golf talent will work out fine.
That's what it's got to be getting to the players that they're to show tomorrow the best.
Now I have to leave my partner, they have to go and also show you everything that's best as an individual player."
In contrast to Bjørn, his miner, Jim Furick, has hoped for a better individual game of his sportsmen than the one they had demonstrated in partnership, except for Jordan Speedet and Justin Thomas, who took three points from four.
conferences themselves have been on either side of this match for the last day, playing the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had "The Wood in Mede."
"I remember every word of it," he said, responding to a question like Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 Captain tuned his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we always want to have a fast start that you've seen in Brooklyn and in Media.
When the speed is growing, the biggest pressure is put on those who play the match in the middle.
We've drawn the appropriate layout and put those players in the way we liked them, so you know, we're going to try to get a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas got the job of starting to play around and speaking against Rory Mclroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tomie Flitwood and Ian Paulter will play against the big golfists.
"I have put my players in this order, for I believe it's so will close everything," said Bjorn about his choice for an individual match.
Resetting of the new German warship again postponed
The new Navy frigate Germany had to get in order in 2014 to replace the old warships with the Cold War, but it will appear no sooner in the following year because of inadequate systems and the constantly increasing costs of local media reports.
The descent of the "Rheinland-Phalz", a main ship of the absolutely new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, as reported by the Die Zeit newspaper, quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be in order in 2014, but the problems that came after the building were impeding the project.
Four warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered as early as 2007, must replace old Bremen frigates.
They'll be armed with strong cannons, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and some "stels" technologies, such as reduced visibility for radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics is the longer periods between technology – more than new frepts may not enter their parties by two years.
"However, permanent delays mean that modern battleships" -- which can enable Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country -- will expire as long as they get in a state of affairs with Die Zeit.
The miserable F-125 frigate came into the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
The first Navy warship returned ship to ship after delivery.
There are few reasons to return, but the German media wrote about many, many "deficits in software and equipment" making ships useless in a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg ships have only 120 sailors – half the crew of the old Bremen class.
It also found that the ship is of a very large weight, which reduced its productivity and limited its ability to further update.
"Rheinland-Phalz" weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of ships of the like class that used Germany in the Second World War.
Besides laying the price of the entire project - including training the crew - also becomes a problem.
The price reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion) – first it was 2.2 billion euros.
Problems that accumulated with new frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the sea power of Germany is changing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defense committee for the German parliament, announced that the Navy "has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions."
He stated that the problem sometimes increases, for there are old ships listed, and no ships replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg's Frigates could join the Navy.
National Society for the Smiling of monuments has overheard the secret life of the bats
A new study, which was carried out in the Scotch Hill, was aimed at discovering how bats use landscapes in their food hunt.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of unique flying babies and to help future actions to protect those animals.
A study of Scotland's National Society of Survivors has been conducted by small bats and long-roofed Dubton bats in the winter gardens of Invress in the Western Ross.
Special writing devices will be located in the main places around this area to keep track of the bats' actions during the season.
Collaboration workers and volunteers will do mobile studies using manual detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all data items determines the frequency of the bat call, and also what jobs are doing.
A consumption map and a report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behaviour of these animals in this landship.
Rob Duard, the National Society for the Conservation of Nature, expects the results to show what areas are most important to bats and how they are used by every species.
This information helps you determine the benefits of creating habitats like meadows and of supporting forests for live bats and other related animals.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has changed considerably in the last century.
They're threatened by building and developing work that affects and destroys their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can be dangerous as well as sticky mollusks and some chemicals for building materials, as well as pet cats.
The sayings are not blind at all.
Yet, because of their night-time life, bats' ears are more networky than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use complex technology to detect bugs and obstacles in their flight.
National society, which handles more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, is very serious about the treatment of bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, check their habitats and, at times, save lives.
The organization even created the first and only Scotch bat worshipper, in the Tribes Mannock, in Dumfrís and Galway, where eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland live.
King David Thompson says it's an ideal territory for bats.
"Here in three, we just have a wonderful place to bat," he said.
"We have an old hansom, a lot of old trees, and a very good place to live.
But we don't know a lot about bats yet, so our job here and in other properties will help them understand what they need in order to live better."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before you rebuild the asset, as it can be unintentionally destroyed by killing up to 400 females and young bats, which will result in the complete destruction of local populations.
The ships are under protection and are not allowed to kill, frighten, trouble or destroy their villages.
Elizabeth Feral, a member of the bat protection organization in Scotland, calls for public assistance in this case.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and about many species we don't even know how to live their populations."
The Rando claims to be guilty of rape and his lawyers are going to sue the German log
You know, the Rando speaking of accused him of raping "fable news," saying that people want to "advertise themselves", using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue on the German magazine Der Spiegel which published these charges.
The warrant of the Partugulia and Juventus Congregation was accused of raping the American city of Katrina Major in a room in Los Vegas in 2009.
Then he would sort of pay her $375,000 for silence, and he wrote Friday to Der Spiegel.
In a video entitled Instagram Live 33-year-old Rando addressed 142 million subscribers a few hours after the prosecution's release, calling this message "fable news."
“No, no, no, no.
Today's what we're talking about," said the fifth-fold owner of the gold ball in front of the camera.
"They want to make an advertisement in my name.
It's okay.
They want to be known by name, but this is part of my job.
I'm a happy and kind man," he added with a smile.
Jurist Rando prepares a case against the Der Spiegel magazine concerning charges which have been called "the invalid report of suspicion in private," reports the Reuters agency.
Christian Shertz's counsel stated that the player would claim compensation for "moral damage in a sum which corresponds to the difficulty of human rights abuses, and in recent years this may be the most serious personal rights infringement."
It was like having an incident in June 2009 when the building room, Pauls Howell and Cassinov, in Los Vegas, came into existence.
Meeting in the Runald and Major's Night Club, it was as if it were back at the fumbalist's room, where he had allegedly raped her anna as written in the documents of the Clark County Circuit Court in Nevada.
The major says that since then, Randall has sworn in and said that at 99 percent he's "good guy", who suffers from "one percent."
The document says that Randall admitted they had sex but said they would.
The major claims also that he went to the police and took photos of injuries in the hospital but then agreed to a court of law because she "was very afraid of revenge" and she was worried that she would be "publicly Taken".
A 34-year-old woman says she's now trying to re-establish blame, because she feels moral trauma for that incident.
At the time, if there was one happening this morning in Randallo, it would take a trip to Madrid, "Real" with Manchester University, and this summer it would be the capital of Juventus, shutting down a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexite: The United Kingdom will always feel the loss of cars
The Great Britain is "always sorry", and when you lose your status as world leader of car building after Brexita, Greg Clarke, Minister for Business Affairs.
He added that his "anxiety" statement by Toyota UK for BBC was that, when Britain left the EU without agreement, then the company temporarily cut down production at a factory in Bernaston, not far from Darby, half-way.
"We need a agreement," said Mr. Clark.
Japan's car manufacturer said that the effect of a delay on the border as a result of a Brexit- -without a agreement can reduce jobs.
The factory in Bairnaston -- where Toyota Auris and Avenue are being done -- last year produced nearly 150,000 cars, of which 90 percent were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my opinion, when Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyta in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom raised the question of how cross-border trade will take place when Britain gets out of the EU without agreement. These include Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it shuts down its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexita.
It's mostly due to the fact that automobiles are talking about the risk of supply chains as a result of a Brexite without agreement.
The TOYP production line works on a "additional period" basis, when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from the suppliers, both in the UK and in the EU for cars that are built on demand.
When the Great Britain of March 29th leaves the EU without agreement, there may be a breaking which leads to delay and a lack of parts.
For Tyler we can't keep at a factory in Derby more than a day's supply of parts, stated a company, so we're going to stop.
Pope Clarke stated that the "Plan Chockers" of Therese May's future relationship with the EU "is done exactly as to avoid these border checks."
"We need an agreement, and we're going to get the best agreement that not only allows the success of today, but also allows us to use that opportunity," he stated in the today program on BBC Radio 4.
"information that we get from not only Toyota but also other providers, means that we should be able to continue working on successful supply chains."
The company Toyota couldn't tell how long the production would go, but it had been warned that a cost had been added to reduce the competitiveness of the factory and would reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsvalaris, who works in Bernaston for 24 years and is the co-counsor of the union, said, "By my turn, if jobs are cut short, they're no longer re-established.
The government's press secretary said, "We offered an exact plan for our future relationship with the EU, which deserves to be trusted."
The White House states that Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
A very important meeting of Donald Trump and the assistant to prosecutor-General Rodnstein could be "done yet for a week," while a struggle around the candidate in the top court of Bret Kavano, declared on a Sunday by the representative of the White House.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Robert Mueller's Special Adviser, who studies Russian electoral interference, the communication of Trump's assistants with Russia and the potential interference with justice from the President.
Release Trump the assistant general prosecutor or not, and thus endanger the independence of Mueller, months puts oil in the fire of Washington's gossip.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taking a hidden mic in order to make a conversation with Trump and that the opportunity to remove the president from his position using 25 paper.
Rosenstein denied it.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid the rumor that he was going to resign.
Instead it was announced that Thursday would meet Trump, who was at the time at the AU headquarters in New York.
Trump said he wouldn't "want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colluding at a hearing in the Senate's legal commission where Cavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blace Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered a week's investigation of the FBI's statement against Kavano that even took a slow vote in the Senate.
The Tramp's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on a Sunday program at Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "Well, as long as you don't have to, probably, this week in the next week, I believe it's rather a week later, taking into account all the other things that fall within the Supreme Court case.
But everything will happen, and I always give press new information."
Some journalists are willing to issue a challenge to her advice: Sanders has not held a briefing for press in the White House since September 10.
Leading the program Chris Wolas asked her why.
Sanders said that the rare thing about brigging is that you don't care about broadcasters who are "working on the public" but he said, "According to the fact that they're working on the audience."
Then she said that the direct contact of Trump and the press would increase.
"The President will meet more with questions from the press than any President that has been before him," she said, adding, without certain facts, "We have learned those figures."
Brifing is going on, wrote Sanders, but "If the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We've tried to do that often, you've seen us do it in the last few weeks, and it's like this.
Trump regularly answers questions when she leaves a White House or takes part in meetings outside, or at press conferences with high foreign guests.
The President's own press conference is rarely held.
This week in New York the President demonstrated why when free and sometimes extraordinary appearances before reporters.
A minister of health wrote to an EU worker in the system of environmental health in Scotland before Brexit
The Ministry of Health has written to EU employees who are working on the health care system in Scotland in order to express their appreciation on behalf of the country and to want them to remain after Brexito.
Jan Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government is already willing to cover the cost of applications from EU citizens working in the national services of the country.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "The talks between the Great Britain and the EU about the exit of our country continued: they are bringing the expected solutions for this fall.
But the British government had also riped for scripting without agreement.
I know that for all of you this is a very restless time.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contributions of each worker, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all the countries of the EU and not only give valuable experience and skills that reinforce and improve health care, they also benefit patients and their communities.
Scotch is your home and we want you to stay with us."
Christian Abercrombie transferred a temporary operation after a May head
Lynbecker of the Tennesse State Tigers Christian Abercrombie team experienced an urgent operation after having received his May head in a Sunday match that his team lost 31-27 command Vandbilt Commodores, notified by Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The main coach of the Tennessee State House Red told the reporter that a May player had got shortly before the break.
"He went over to his sideline and suddenly fell," said the reed.
The coaches and medals had given the Abercombs a sour yet in the field before putting it on the field and moving it to set the diagnosis.
Last Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombies had been operated into the Wanderbilt medical center.
Harris added that there's no "the truth about what it was like" and Tennessee State would try to find out if the player got injured.
Aercombie, a fellow sportsman, spends the first season of the Tennessee State after moving out of Illinois.
Before he left the game on Saturday, he made five complete snatches, which only gives he 18 grabs per season.
Foreign consumers of British stillness would pay a large coat
According to the new conservation plan, foreign consumers of British estate will pay a higher degree of coverage, and extra money will be used to help the homeless
This action neutralizes the success of Corbin initiative by involving young voters.
We're going to gain a lot of government output for those who don't pay the taxes in Britain
The finance ministry plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year for the homeless
Today, Theresa May will introduce, that foreign consumers of British estate will pay the higher national yen and the extra money will go to the care of the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbina's initial engagement with young voters and it also means that housing is available, so it's directed at people with high incomes.
The raise of the state farm is directed at people and businesses that don't pay their taxes in Britain and the getting money will take over the government's homeless housing program.
The raising of the present state battle, including the higher levels taken two years ago, to buy second houses and employment housing, can take up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is hoping to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of the new buildings in London are bought by the U.K.- -that leads to higher prices and new buyers being hard to buy their first dwelling.
Many rich regions of the country – and especially the capital city – have become a ghost city, because most of the shopping from outside the United Kingdom does not live in Britain.
The new policy came literally a few weeks after Barry Johnson's call to lower his national policy on young consumers in order to facilitate the acquisition of the first dwelling.
He accused large building firms of keeping high the price of stillness by taking over the land and burning it, and called upon Mistress May to cancel the quota on available shelter in order to bring about the "grace and shelter" in Britain.
Colonel Corbin announced a large series of shelter reforms including control of the rents and the halting of "unmatchable" hanging.
He also wants to pass on to the local council more authority in the building of dwellings.
Mrs. May said, "Last year, I've stated that I will dedicate my job to Prime Minister in restoring British dream: life for every new generation must be best.
It means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
It's unfair, however, that people who don't live in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as British workers.
But for too many people, the dream of having their own home becomes more and more demanding and the problem of the homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to run a Scots Collection."
"Sanderland" coach Jack Ross said his main ambition is to ever become a coach of the Scots Collection.
The 42-year-old Scotsman performs the task of restoring the club from the northeast, which now lies in the third place of the First League, with three points from the first.
He moved on to this work in the summer after he returned to St. Irene's Scot-League last season.
"I wanted to speak for my country as a player.
But failed," said Ross in a transmission of BBC Scotland's Sport Well.
"I grew up often sick for Scotland at the Hampeden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
But that opportunity will appear if I'm a successful club coach."
This includes Ross's predecessors, who was the coach of Sanderland, Dick Addwakat, David Moses, Sam Alaradeis, Martin O'Neil, Roy King, Gus Pius, and Paula di Kanya.
There was a coach, Aloa Atleticus, who says that he didn't feel afraid of such a famous name at such a big club, previous to the offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Tawn.
"Now success for me will be the answer to 'might I be able to return this club to Prime League?'
Because of the structure and the material base of his club, his place is certainly in Prime Lisa," he said.
"Not just return it back there, but I'll count my job successful only if I can get it back to the club."
Ross has been a coach for only three years, and he has been a coach's assistant at Dambarton, and he's worked for 15 months at the Harts coach's.
Then he helped the "Aloa" return with the third league and turned Saint-Mireen into a loser, which almost ended in the champion of the next season.
Ross says he's getting more comfortable right now than he did during his career as a Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, Saint-Mirene, and Hamilton Academy.
Recalling the work at Aloa, he said, "It was a really important choice."
And I said, "I really believe that training is something I need, even more than the game.
It's incredible that I've worked well and earned and achieved a certain height.
But the game can be heavy.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm going through this when you talk about stress and pressure, but training is what you need.
I always wanted to train and now do it, and to me it's the goodest time in my whole adult life."
The complete interview can be heard on the Sportdound program on Saturday, September 30th, at Radio Scottland between 12:00 and 13:00 British summer time
According to the study, an ideal time to have a pint of beer is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday.
And the hot summer has increased the income of British fighters' fight for survival, but it brought pressure on the network of restaurants.
Well, according to the pub and bar statistics, there was a 2.7 percent increase in sales in the car eye, but in restaurants the sales fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA advisory business group, who was collecting this statistics, said, "Stressing solar weather and longer than expected, participating in the English team at the end of the World CGA, means that what happened in June was that, if the pub increased sales by 2.8 percent, then the restaurant suffered even more.
And so the decrease in sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June, it's just decreased in speed.
Bends and bars which mostly sell drinks until they show at the best, compared to restaurants.
The pubs that sell more food also got dressed on the sun, although not as hard as the restaurant.
And it looks like people just wanted to drink.
"In pubs and bars, the sale of drinks grew by 6.6 percent, and the sale of food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM on resting-places, said, "These results are from a tender that we've seen since the end of April.
There have to be some very important data about intelligence and the influence of social events as well. What it's about is the amount of sales on the public food market.
No wonder restaurants continue to struggle because they have fallen by 4.8 percent per year, and that's very unpleasant when prices go up.
The long and hot summer came at a very bad time for operators who were concentrated on eating, and time would show whether the lower temperatures in August would bring on such a expected relief."
So the total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including recently opened, glass trees in the blinding of 2.7 percent, is reflected in the slowness in the unfolding of the brands.
A tool to track sales in British pubs, bars and restaurants Coffer Pach Tracker collects and analyses output from 47 active groups that share a 9 billion pounds in common, and is an important rank in that field.
Every fifth child has a secret account in his social networks that it hides from his parent
The study showed that 1 out of every 5 children -- some turned up just 11 -- have secret social networking accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
Studying 20,000 students from high school showed the growth of Facebook pages
This news raised fears that they were publishing sexual content there.
Twenty percent of the students said they had an "main" account which tells parents
One in five children is a child. In some cases it's only 11 who creates accounts in social networks that keep secret from parents.
When we studied 20,000 students in middle schools, we found a rapid growth in Facebook accounts - which is something like showing on an instagram exchange of photos.
The news raised fears that they were publishing sexual content there.
Two percent of the students said they put in pure core accounts to show you my parents and they also have private accounts.
One mother, who had accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter found out that she had urged others to rape me.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and a conference of independent schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of teenagers between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles and half of them found out they had secret accounts.
And chapter HMC Mike Buchanan said, "It's very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create an Internet site where they're not found by either parents or teachers."
He's a Scotch guy.
Elijah Doyle was elected to the Scotch Council by a slight athlete as an observer member of the Council for the annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle is the most sophisticated Scotch ourselves and chairman Ian Beatie described the event, as a great opportunity for those who run sports to benefit a lot from her experience at the most various levels, including the international one in the last decade.
"Eylde enjoys great respect in Scotland, Britain and the world as well as the scoundrel, and we're sure that a slight athletic in Scotland will get much useful from her work in the glimmer," said Beatie.
Doyle said, "I want to act as a sportsman's voice, and I hope I'm going to help manage sports in Scotland."
An American who won the gold at a distance of 200 and 400 meters on the 1996 Atlas Olympic and two other gold medals on other Olympics and who is now working on BBC cannot walk after a micro stroke.
He put that on Twitter, and he said, "A month ago, I experienced a blow.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that this is just the time to show if and to what extent I'm getting involved.
It was a hard work, but I'm completely improved, and I'm learning to walk again and I'm doing survival exercises!

A slight pampering ad where mothers are compared to cows, has given Internet views
The small pampas campaign shared an opinion by issuing an advertising campaign that compares nursing women to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what are called " the world's first designated milk pump", a consumer company named Elvie released an ironic music advertisement based on video to show the freedom that that food source gives that tool a feeder mother.
Four real mothers dance in a barn with cows up to a song where there's these words: "Yes, I give myself but I don't have a tail," and "On occasion, if you didn't notice that it doesn't measure up, it's my chest."
And he said, "Yes, please, I feed my children, yes, yes, yes, I give my women."
But an ad that was posted on a company's Facebook page triggered a hot debate on the Internet.
There were 77,000 views and hundreds of comments -- and the reaction to that video was mixed, many said, "That's just a nightmare."
“ Too bad the decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like we, they must stretch and grow up to give milk, that's just their kids being picked up after a few days," wrote one spectator.
Elvie milk pump is inconspicuously concealed in nursing shelter (Elvie/Mother)
And another comment said, "You know, I mean it's tragic for my mother and for my child.
But why don't you use them for small-time ads for mothers who don't take care of children?"
And somebody added, "This is the random advertisement."
And other people said, "You're not allowed to do that." And one woman said, "I'm forgetful."
And I said, "I think it's a brilliant idea.
I wish I had one, if I could feed my breast.'
sucking the milk makes me feel cow.
This is an advertisement, a bit crazy, but I actually enjoyed it.
That's the genius product," she wrote.
One other comment is, "Very forgetful advertisement, it directed at mothers, who suck up milk pampas (often at work or in the toilet) and hear themselves "colored."
This is an advertisement that doesn't support or condemn the small industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with invisible milk pampas hidden in bras.
The concept of an advertising company is that a lot of women who use light pumps feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump pump pump pump is entirely carefree, has no rights, no pipes, and imperceptibly concealed in nursing women's airs, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep children, and even leaves home during device work.
Ana Ballarín, a partner and creative director of Mother, noticed, "Elvie Pump's product is so revolutionary that it's something that deserves special and legal launching.
So in a parallel between nursing women and young cows, we wanted to focus on sucking milk and its difficulties, and at the same time demonstrating in a strange and good- natured way how a new milk pump will bring about extreme freedom of movement.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's tiny pump gets to be the center of attention.
During the London fashion week the mother of two children appeared on the invocation of the clothes from Martha Yakubski using that product.
Hundreds of migrant children without any excess noise are transferred to a mining camp on the technological border
Although the number of border crossings has remained almost unchanged within the month, a sharp increase in the number of detained migrant children has been due in part to severe rhetoric or politics, which are carried out by the Trumpe administration, which has extended the position of children with sugar daddys.
Traditionally, most sugar daddys are illegal immigrants, who are afraid to endanger their own stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
Much of the risk has grown in June when the federal authorities have announced that a potential sugar daddy and other full-fledged homeowners will have to file a fingerprint with their fingers and have to be handed over to the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albens, a member of the Immigration and Customs Service, spoke to Congress about the arresting agencies of invitations from people who were asked to sponsor minors without warrant.
The agency reported later that 70 percent of those arrested had had no criminal cases.
"About 80 percent of the persons who are sugar daddys or members of their households are in an illegal country, and a large part of them are foreign nationals from the criminal past.
That's why we're pursuing those people," said Mr. Albens.
For the faster processing of children, officials have introduced new rules which require some people to appear in the court within a month of their detention, although, according to shelter workers, their earlier standard term of 60 days.
A great number of people who apply for their own legal status in an immigration court will need to have video connections rather than be present in a personal court.
People who don't have any reason to help are quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and messages from sources in the system that have appeared in the past months, more children have remained in exile, the more likely a depression or an increase in trouble is to result in violent explosions or attempts to escape.
Counselians claim that in more large institutions, such as Tarnillas, these problems are much stronger, since the signs that a child is in a bitter state are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the establishment.
They add that moving children into a boil-down place without giving them time for emotional preparation or for having a friend to talk to may make a trip out of, a lot of things that have already happened.
Serbia requires immediate output of the United States of America, France and Turkey
And in return to the General Assembly of the U.N., the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Valid al-Mual also called on the Syrian refugees to return home despite the war of the eighth year in the country.
Mualm, who is also a deputy of the Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian land on the basis of a fight against terror, and "they will be considered appropriate".
"They must immediately go away and stand no mind," he said at the meeting of the Assembly.
Mualm insisted that in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011, and a million people have had to leave their homes, the war against terror is almost finished.
He stated that Damascus intended to continue "to conduct this holy battle until we clear out all the Syrian territories" from both the terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
There are about 2,000 United States military personnel in Syria who are mainly teachers and storytellers of the Kurds and Syrian Arabs in opposition to the President of Bashar Assad.
The land contingent of France on this destroyed war-torn country has more than 1,000 soldiers.
On a question from the refugees, Mualm stated that the conditions for return were favourable and accused "some western country" in "the spread of irrational fears" that held refugees abroad.
"We call upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They politicize an extremely humane question."
The United States and the European Union are warned that Syria will not be assisted in updating until a political agreement has been reached between the Assad and the opposition to the war.
The ANN diagnostics report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey concerning the creation of a buffer zone in the last violent explainor of the Idlibe rebels created an opportunity for political negotiations.
The Russian-Tork agreement prevented the broad-based offensive of the Syrian forces by Russia into a province where three million people live.
However, Mualm stressed that the agreement had "precious terms" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including Al-Qaidan fighters, who would "be destroyed."
Ambassador Aung Stafan deCity is expecting to roll the first seats of a new committee, which will include government officials and the opposition to develop a second constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
After saying that the condition for the participation of the Syrian government in the Bureau is that the work of the Commission should be confined to "the review of the articles of a functioning constitution" and to caution against interference.
Why Trump will go into second term
And by this logic, Mr. Trump won the 2020 elections, when many liberal spectators hope to complete the impeachment and scandal before the end of his presidency.
I think that will be, no doubt, "The most dramatic final part of the presidency in all history!"
At the moment there is no sign of the weariness of spectators.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have grown more than twice as high as 1.05 million per CNN and nearly three times as high as 1.6 million times MSNC.
By Nielsen's Day, there were 2.4 million viewers in the average, compared to 1.7 million people four years ago, and the channel "The Rachel Maddown Show" was picked up by MSNC on screen by 3.5 million viewers and passed the cable television ratings on to the evenings when it was broadcasting the main news.
"It's a fire that people are clinging to because we don't understand," says Neil Behr, director of the ABC drama, "Contagion" about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president of the attack that destroyed the Capitolia.
In Nelly Squielle, a massive comedy and author of the book "A Pair of Funny Details and Several Hard Truths about Going into the Hollywood Boys Club," there's a different theory.
She remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
–Why?' she asked.
He said, "Because it cheers me up," said Miss Scowell.
Chaos is precious yet and what can amuse.
Of course, unlike all the rest of television, the plot lines that come out of Washington can be as determined as the future in the case of the Riys v. Wade case, depending on that, whether or not the families of immigrants will come together and the health of the world economy.
Ignoring it is a luxury which can only afford the most privileged spectators.
And yet, when you're watching for six o'clock as a group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodward's "information not for printing" in the book "The Fear," Paul Manaforth's jacket for 15,000 dollars, with skin hairskins, it goes out over the simple framework of Mr. Trump's desire to be aware of the issues.
I'll never, for example, look at Super Mary like I used to.
"Some of what he does, makes you feel as if you were looking at the reality-show which he shows every evening," says Brent Manthomer, executive director of "Helhouse NES" and author of the "Pawn Stars" about the evolving actor composition of the Tramp show and the permanent turns of the story "Sparing" in the NFL, approved by Kim Chen Ein".
You can't afford to skip even one episode, otherwise you can't move away from the tender.
As I spoke to Mr. Flags this week, outside the windows of his house on the north bank of the Coois, there stood a warm day and 30 degrees of heat, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while CNN was writing.
He couldn't turn himself off, not at the time when Brett Kavan stood before the Trial Committee of the Senate, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which was hanging from a shaft.
"I remember little girls when we released those crazy shows, and people were like, "It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Flake.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be right."

The external cash streams are introduced into a stiff frontal race of the elections into a House of Representatives
No wonder the 17th Selection District of Pennsylvania is covered with a money bar because of a change in the district boundaries of the Congress, so the two candidates stand in elections at one place.
Recently painted beautiful district of Pitzburg around the democrat, a member of the House of Conar Lamb, who won his place in another district in the middle of the previous spring.
The llembo stands for another functioning deputate, the republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which becomes largely the same as the new 17th.
The maps were drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court- -as determined by the studio- -that the voices of the old districts were unconstituted in the favour of the republics.
The elective race in the new 17th district caused the decline in the financing of the companies by major parties, the Comité Campas of the Democratic Company (CCDC) and the National Committee of the Republic Company (NCC).
Lemb became known in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory at widely educated peaks in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
That place had been occupied by the Republic over a decade, and President Donald Trump had won a 20-point break in the district.
Political experts will find a small advantage in democrats.
The US appreciated the punishment of El Salvador for supporting China and then retreated.
The diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already supported Beijing in spite of the insignificant Washington opposition.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the corresponding Trump team.
The State Department decided to cancel American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama concerning "the recent decisions concerning Taiwan's non-acceptance," declared by the press secretary, Mr. Heather Nairt early this month.
However, sanctions were applied only to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in American assistance in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
Suggested sanctions which included reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions would be painful to the country of Central America with its high rate of unemployment and murder.
Following up on the internal meeting, the representatives of North and Central America postponed the implementation of the high-level conference, devoted to security and economic prosperity, which would constitute a continuation of the similar last year, which was conveyed as a step in efforts to prevent immigration into the United States.
But before the middle of September, high-level officials continued to understand what they wanted the conference to hold and actually stopped consideration of the punishment of El Salvador.
And as far as polls are concerned, the Vice-President Mike Pennsylvania is now speaking at a conference in the middle of October in sign of the administration's support for an event.
And the three American envoys without any excess noise returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard jobs or penalties from Washington.
In addition to the White House, Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate which had been described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal issues subject to continued anonymity.
Their messages are directed to someone else, close to the analyst's administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.

The next step is to report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on a possible interference with justice for Mr. Trumpe, on which very difficult evidence is now available in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Müller drew attention in an investigation into the potential Supremacy of the company Trump and Russia as an attack on the elections.
When Congress changes his master, Mr. Trump stops before the face of his responsibility to this body, just as he prepares to speak again to the voters, and perhaps eventually to the jury from among his relatives.
There is a lot of "if," and I don't mean to say that Mr. Trump's fall is imminent, just like that in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make a choice which determines how long the struggle will last.
In 1938 the German officers were ready for the national coup against Hitler, if only the West had asked him to join and supported the Czech Republic in Munich.
We've lost the game. We've missed the opportunity to avoid blood for the next few years.
The story is turned around such a tipping moment, and the indistinguishable march of democracy accelerates or delays.
Directly now the Americans have encountered several of those critical moments.
What happens when Mr. Trump fired the deputy of the Attorney-General of Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein found himself in a difficult position since he wrote about last year's gasket- -and he offered to write a secret message to the President and to think about his capacity.
Mister Rosenstein says the translation of The Times is inaccessible.
"How shall we react when the recent FBI investigation of Breto Kavan is not an overall or fair one, or if he is tried in a Supreme Court in spite of a well-deserved charge of sexual assault and uncontested reports?
And above all, shall we vote in elections for Congrès that will bring Mr. Trump to account?
If we don't do these trials, we'll have a long winter for democracy.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Bohemian Gabrieli who Deported to Auschwitz with the same Nazi regime that once occupied my messenger house.

Graham Dorens of Rangers is optimistic about the front-to-back match with Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers take "Rope Vienna" to Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive night in Spain over William will allow them to step out of group G of the League of Europe confidently.
In May, his knees prevented the halfbacker, Graham Dorans, from speaking to night two to two with William, but he thinks he's going to be able to use it as a springboard.
"This was a fundamental match for us, because William is a strong rival," which is a meditative of 31 years.
"We started playing, thinking we could get something, and we could get a score.
Perhaps at the end of the day, we could kill the ball, but nothing at all became a good result.
They looked better in the first half of the day, but in the second we pulled ourselves together, and we had the best half of the field.
Thursday is another big one for European football night.
Hopefully we can make three points, but that will be a hard game, as they showed a good result in the last game, but since we're a crowd of advocates on the stands, I am sure we can manage them and show you a good game.
The past year was determined to be a heavy one, both because of my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The good team and the lads do enjoy the game; the training is productive.
Hopefully we can move forward, surpass the result of the past season and achieve success."
Women lose their sleep because of fear of retirement
In spite of the fact that the interviewers had an exact idea what they wanted to take care of themselves, few of them spoke about it with their families.
About half the people who were involved in common research said they were talking to their husbands about the long-term care basket.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their kids about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but take no steps to discuss it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of "Nationside" on life insurance.
That's where we should start.
Talk this over with your husband and children: Your family won't be ready to help you if you're not at all ready to do this.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how to get medical help as it can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Drawing on a financial consulting board can also be a way to pay for those costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include the traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that may help cover these costs or you can self-insure your life-- provided that you have money.
Do legal cases: Sorry to appear before the courts.
Take care to provide medical services in case you can not talk.
Also, consider the possibility of making money management trust.
Specify a trustable person to make financial decisions and provide payment of your accounts if you are unable to do so.
Don't forget the details: imagine your elderly father needs immediate medical help and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about prohibited drugs and the existence of an allergy?
Record these details in a written form to be ready.
"We have a role not only in financial matters but also in medicine," adds Martin.

We have to plan this thing."
In Alfredomb in man repeatedly fired against the pneumatic rifle
The man got a couple of tattoos from the pneumatic rifle when he walked home at night.
A shed of 40 years was in the district of Oxford Grove in Ilfracomb, Devon County, when he was shot in his chest, his stomach, and his hand.
The police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30, at the local time, as "a random event."
The victim saw no attacker.
His injuries do not pose a threat to life; the police are asking witnesses to communicate with them.
The earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the official, at least 384 people died as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami that fell upon the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and expect the number of those who died as a result of that age to be lost.
Well, because of the fact that we're all in contact with humanitarians, we haven't been able to get any information from the Dengal Regeneration, a district north of Palau, which is closer to the 7.5th epicenter of the force.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a severe disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Pal and Dongala in the island of Sulawesia:
Half is the capital city of the Central Sulawesis, located at the end of the narrow cove on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 by the year 2017.
When the earthquake happened and the tsunami came in, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regeneracy that spreads over 180 miles (300 km) by the north west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
There was an administrative unit lower than the state, and in 2017 there were 299,200 people.
Fisheries and farming are the basis of the economy of the province of the Central Sulawes, especially the coastal region of the Dongala.
The value of nickel is also an important one for provinces, but it's mostly concentrated in Moral, on the opposite coast of the Sulawesi.
In the name of the Indian Institute of Natural Disasters, Palau and Dongala have been hit several times in the last 100 years by a tsunami.
In 1938, more than 200 people lost their lives in the tsunami in Dongala, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
India is in a symmetric-active Pacific kale and has regularly collapsed earthworms.
The lowest reported list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in the last few years is today one of the following:
2004: A strong earthquake in the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra, on 26 December the tsunami hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: a series of strong earthquakes crashed on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March-th of April.
Hundreds of people died in the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude earthquake of 6.8 occurred in the south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast resulting in the deaths of some 700 people.

Sarah Pelin's oldest son was arrested on charges of domestic assault within the family
Track Paylin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan dier and vice-candant to the President of Sarah Palin, was arrested on the charge of attack.
Peylin, 29 years old, in Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on a suspicion of being killed at home this evening in exchange for reports of a home rape and a supporting arrest published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a well-known police officer tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up his phone number.
And then we go to "KTU", and we have Paylin in the next 500-dollar isolation from Mathansk-Suestna.
He appeared in the court on Saturday where he declared himself "pretty innocent," if he was asked if he admitted the blame, notified the network.
He's accused of three class A violations and he's threatened with up to one year's imprisonment and a fine of 250,000 dollars.
He's also accused of committing class B crime, which is punishable by breaking his will on a day and fine of 2,000 dollars.
It's not the first time Palin has been accused.
He was accused in December 2017 of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to let her tell about the alleged attack.
The case is now under consideration by the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In winter 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, fabricating the report of rape into the family and keeping his arms in a state of alcoholic beverages on account of the incident.
His girl said he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Pelin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior with the post-traumatic syndrome caused by his service in Iraq.

The Federal Prosecutor's Office calls for a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist in New York City.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office in New York is being tried for a death penalty for Syfula Saipal, suspected of being a terrorist in New York City, resulting in eight deaths – an rare punishment which has not been used in the state of federal crime since 1953.
Saip, 30 years old, in October he probably used the U.S. hire of a home Depot truck to visit a bike road along the Westside highway in Bajam Manhattan, beating pedestrians and bikes on his way.
To establish the death sentence, by notification of the intention of secureing a death penalty imposed on the South District of New York, the prosecutor must prove that the Siopov "intently" hit eight people and "intently" caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court's materials, for both violations, a possible penalty of death.
A few weeks after the attack, the great federal coroner sculled Saipala with an indictment of 22 charges which included eight charges of murder to support the raid; this paragraph is usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and also charges of assault and destruction of vehicles.
And the teachers said, "Careful and deliberate planning" and they used phrases like "disgusting, hard and spoiled" to describe the crimes committed by the Soviet authorities.
"Seifula Habibulevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ana-Lora Decadt, Daren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernán Diego Mendez and Alejandro Damian Pag," is the description of the intentions of the report.
The five of those killed were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last criminal case, with a death penalty in South York District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted for the murder of two drug suppliers, but he finally was sentenced to death in September 2009.
The most recent death penalty in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple sentenced after they had two years been convicted of conspiracy for spying on behalf of the Soviet Union during the cold war.
Rosenberg's couple was punished with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saip, a citizen from Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated the absence of an honest report in the days and months following the attack.
He said to the police, "He says it's a pleasure to have something he did."
In the face of the prosecution- -Saip reported to the authorities that he was inspired to watch the video broadcast by the Islamic State on the phone.
He also asked permission to carry the flag of the Islamic State to the hospital palace, reported to the police.
He doesn't think he's guilty of any 22-point conviction.
David Paton, one of the federal social defenders representing Saipawa, said that they were "unsurely disappointed" in a decision of prosecutor's office.
"We think that the decision to apply death penalty, not death sentence without possible release, is just going to extend the pain of those events for all the players," said Patan.
The Saipa defence team formerly asked the prosecutors to prevent the death penalty.
Parliamentary member from Tore said that Nigel Faraage should signify the Brexitus Constitutions.
Today, during the protest at the Thora conference, Nigel Faraage pledged to "mobilize the people's army."
There was a Ukip leader said that politicians should "feel discomfort" from Europeans--as one of the members of Theresa May Parliament has offered their constitution for negotiations with the EU.
A member of parliament from the Peter Boon conservationist party said during the Birmingham march that the Great Britain would already "come out" if Mr. Faroj had held the position of Moderator in Brexito.
But the problem that Mrs. May had had to face in order to accept her scattered followers- -was even worse when the Torahs, in favour of saving EU membership, broke down a separate protest against Brexita in the city.
The queue is trying to keep the Cherries's compromise agreement under constant pressure by the followers and employees to exit as well as by the EU itself. It's a very good idea.
The allies insist that they're trying to make a connection with Brussels, despite having a negative reaction, and want to force the Europeans and the lesbians to come out between her package and the "disguss."
Mr. Bown said at a rally in Salihala, "I'm leaving," that he wanted, "to get Chuck off the board."
He suggested that Mr. Faraja should have made equal and put up duties for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would already go out," he said.
Wellingbor's parliament member added, "I'm for Brexite, but we need to get away from the Checker Plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We have not fought the world war to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our country."
"The idea that the British had changed their mind and wanted to stay is not exactly the same thing."
Brexita's host and member of the Torah, Andrea Jenkins was also on a march, and she said, "I'm just going to say, "Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Checker's plan is not popular among the general public, the opposition isn't going to vote for it, it's unpopular in our party and activists who actually come out and pick us up.
Please abandon the plan and start listening."
And she said, "In a nutshell," and she said, "The Prime Ministers are staying on their plate when they do their promises."
Well, Sir Farme said that politicians should get "feeling discomfort" when they are going to betray the 2016 decision.
"This is now a matter of trust between us--people and politics," he said.
They're trying to betray Branch, and we're here today to say, "That won't get you out of hand."
In his speech to an enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to force those politicians of ours who are willing to betray Braceto to feel discomfort.
"We mobilize the national army of this country that has given us victory in Brexia, and we shall never settle down until we become independent, self- set, proud in the community."
Meanwhile the workers came out through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
Several activists waved the banners of Tories Against Brexit after the group's start up this weekend.
The Liebaric Per Lord Adamis dealt with the recipients of the security problem whom they encountered because of a party program at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can be ready to use the IT system and all the technology for Canada plus, for the borders without training, for the free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full farce.
A thing like good Brecsit. It doesn't exist," he added.
Worren plans to pay close attention to the voting process for his presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the elections of November it "takes a keen attention to the process of chatting for the office of President."
The Boston Globe reports that the democracy of Massachusetts on Saturday revealed its future during the general meeting of the Western Massachusetts State.
Warren, who's often criticized President Donald Trump, is going to move to re-election, and she's against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Diel, who was a member of the Trump company at Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the heart of the debate as likely a Trump mineral in 2020.
Since Trump's assumption of office this was already the 36th meeting with voters in general east, which was held on a Saturday afternoon in Halioke.
One of the attendees asked if it planned to run for the office of President.
Warren said it's time to "come to Washington to correct the broken government, and for that to happen, it's high time for the woman."
The arrest took place after the death of basketball player Sims of the University of Louisiana
The police of Baton Rose, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that we had been suspected of killing basketball player WAYD Sims on Friday.
The police office at Baton Pink announced the arrest of 20-year-old Titan Simpsan during a press conference which took place at 11 a.m.
On Friday they published a video recording of the shooting, asking if they could identify the man who was on it.
The 20 year old Sims was shot into death on the morning at the University of South.
"Weid Sims got an acute wound in the head resulting in his death," stated Saturday's columnist "247ports" to police chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot dead by Simpson.
In the course of the interrogation Simpson confessed to being in the scene of a crime, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
SAMPSON Not supported the arrest and was taken into custody in the police enforcement of the East Baton-Rose County.

Grant to Russia: Lewis Hamilton was approaching the title of the world championship after the intra-commanded victory agreement over Sebastian Fetel
From the time that valter Botas got to be that professional coming on Saturday Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the orders inside the Mercedes team were playing a significant role in the race.
Bottos pulled up a good place on the beggar and had almost left Hamilton at the will of his fate until he defended his place on the first two sovereigns and invited Fetall to attack his friend on the team.
The meane first went to a pit-stop and left Hamilton to cobble at the end of the total mass of pursuers, which was the manoeuvre which had to be decisive.
The Mercedes pilot went to a pit stop at a later date and came out behind Fetall, but Hamilton came forward after a few manoeuvres of circle-in-circuit, which forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inner space of a free, risking to stay after a double manoeuvre to clean him up on the third favour.
Max Ferstapen on his 21st birthday started with a back series of networks and until the end of the first circle was at the seventh place.
Then he led most of the race, until kept the tires up, for he wanted to quickly finish, overtake Kim Ryan and take the fourth place.
And the result was that it got to a pit-stop on circle 44, but it couldn't increase speed on any of the other eight circles, so Ryan took the fourth place.
It was a hard day because the Walters all spoke fantastically and said to themselves the true gentleman, if I should be allowed to speak like that.
"The Command has done an overwork to take the first place and the second place," commented Hamilton.
It was truly a bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein for mopping on Saturday because she insisted that she wasn't the source of the leak letter by Christine Blace Ford, in which she accused the candidate of being convicted of sexual assault by a higher court of Bret Kavan.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the statements made by the Ford before the Senate's Judicial Chamber, instead of commenting that what was happening in the Senate had shown how people could be " mean, abominable and untrue."
"The only thing that can happen, and what's beautiful is what's happening in the last few days in the Senate, that's when you see anger, when you see wicked, ugly and lying people," he said.
"When you read about the press and the fugitives and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Remember?
A Feynstein, is that your fugitive?
Remember her answer... you lost the document - "Oh, what?
No, no.
There was nothing of me."
Wait a minute.
We let that escape... no, we didn't," he added, counseling the senator.
Fainstein sent a letter of in-depth presentation of the charges raised by the Ford against Covan, and he escaped early in September--but Fainstein denied that the fugitive had taken place with her office.
"I didn't hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I didn't let her story go," said Finn Bureau, reporting "The Hill."
"She has been asked that the story remain confidential and I have complied with her request."
But her rejection probably didn't like the President, who said that during his Saturday rally: "That's what I'll tell you, this was really bad language of the body.
Maybe she did not do it, but it is the worst language of the body which I have ever seen."
Continued defending the candidate in the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women President said that democracy is using charges for its own purposes.
"They are determined to return to power by any means.
You see subterraneanity and martism, and they don't care who they think they're going to have to cross over to get control and control," says the President, "Mediate."

Green's aviator, saving hundreds of passengers from earthquake
A travelper in Indonesia, the hero died ... provided the airplane was successful with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people died, and many were missing in the wake of the great earthquake in the island of Sulawesi on Friday that caused the tsunami.
Strong underground jolts are still on, and many people are buried under the wreckage in the city of Palau.
While his colleagues swarmed with the fugitive, 21-year-old Antônius Gunawan Agung declined to leave his position in the spite of the tower which wildly rolled about at the airport of Paul Muthira Sis Al Jufri.
He remained in place until theboard of the 6321 company, Batik Air, which was at that moment on the flight strip, broke out of the ground.
Then he sprang out of the detective tower when he decided she was broken up.
Later he died in a hospital.
According to the report of the Australian program "ABC News", said by Air Navigation Indonessia, by Johannes Siraith, the director's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We had prepared a helicopter from Bulippan to Kalimantane that had to move him to a larger hospital in a different city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter flew off to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities are afraid that the number of victims can reach several thousand, and the agency's estimate of reduction of the risks of natural disasters claims that access to the city of Dongala, Sigi and Buton is restricted.
Soupov Nugroha's agency ended up saying, "Perhaps the number of victims will increase yet, because many bodies have still not been able to dig out of under the wrecks."
The waves which reached six meters devastated Paul, where a massive funeral would occur on a Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are doubling humanitarian aid.
"Every minute a fast car," said a 35-year-old mother, "I've got a fast car."
Pure water isn't enough.
There's a shop doing it everywhere."
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what's waiting for them here.
This is already a tragedy, but it can all be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Jok Opoda, came to Palau on Sunday and said to the military, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?”
Earlier this year, India had already suffered from earthquakes in Lamboke, which caused the deaths of more than 550 people.
Micronesia's Air Niugini disaster: one person spent no news of a crash following the crash of an airplane in the lagoon
Avia Company, which carried out a flight that caused a crash landing in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, had previously stated that all 47 passengers and a team were safely evacuated from a plane that was melting and now declare missing without any news of a single passenger.
The Air Niugini campaign said it will become a press release on Saturday that it cannot report to a passenger-man on the location of one passenger.
The company reported that it had worked with local governments and hospitals and officials to find a man.
The company did not immediately report any details about the passenger; for example, its age and nationality.
Local boats helped to save the rest of the passengers and the team after the plane landed on the water when they tried to land in the airport of Chuvok Island.
On Friday the officials said that seven people got into a hospital.
The company reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday; they were all in a stable state.
The reason why the crash is as well as the exact sequence of events, we don't know what it is.
By the declarations of both the airline and the US Navy, the plane landed in the Lagoon without flying to the range.
And on the reports of some witnesses, the plane leaped across the headline bar.
And the American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane flew very low.
"It's very successful," said Janes.
He said that he and others had managed to get through the belt in the water to the plane's emergency exits, which had already meltd.
He said that the seamen had panicked and began to shout; and also that he got a small May head.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors, who wereNAMEt forward, also helped to rescue by taking advantage of an unmanned boat to transport people on shore until the plane sank at depths of about 100 feet (30 m).
On behalf of the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of registered aircraft in Papua New Guinea for the last twenty years, but none of them belongs to the air Nigini.
Anathics makes up for the events of the night when a woman was burned by a animal
On Saturday the prosecution completed the presentation of evidence in the trial of a man accused of burning a resident of Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rollet for a few hours gave a statement as an engaged expert in information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used their cell phone records to find out the moving of the 29-year-old decorum, Quintana Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night of her death.
As reports by "The Clarion Ledger," according to Rollo, he got information about the place from several cell phones that showed that Taylor was with Chambers the evening of her death, which contradicted his previous claim.
When the finding that his cell phone was near Chambers' phone at the time, according to his report, he was along with his friend Michael Sanford confirmed, the police were going to ask Sanford.
Sanford gave a statement on Saturday and said that that day he was not in the city.
If the side of the prosecution asked if he said the truth that Sanford was that evening in the van, he claimed to "lie since my van was in Nashville."
One more contradiction was to claim by Tetris that he was familiar with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they knew each other for a week.
He says that some time after his death, Chambers Tellys sent her messages, calls, and contact with her phone.
"He's rubbed it out of his life," said Hayley.
The defence must start the parties' quarrels in the Sunday.
In the words of the judge, it is expected that the case will be referred to the jury later that day.

Another ink?'
A New York nanny sues a married couple for "racial" post after dismissal
A nanny from New York falls on a married couple for a discriminatory dismissal after he has received an occasional message from her mother complaining that she " Has one inkling."
A couple deny being races, as if they're passions- -that they're passions for what they want.
In 2016, Linsie Plask-Flacman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment at finding that the new nanny, Mrs. Morris, had arrived in black, and she had arrived on her first working day.
"NOTHER, IT IS A CARNAZER," wrote Mrs. Plasca-Flacman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending his husband, she twice sent her message to Miss Morris.
After learning that this was an error, Plasca-Flaxman fired Miss Morris, saying that the previous nanny, who was also an African, was having a hard time with her job, and that she was expecting a chip instead of her.
Miss Morris paid the day of work and sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is swimming in court, and she wants to be compensated for dismissal in accordance with the conditions under which she was initially employed, although without contract: $350 a day for six months.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," she said, "post" on Friday.
The couple rejected the charges of racism, arguing that the dismissal of Morris was a reasonable solution, considering that they could not trust her after having insulted her.
"My wife sent her something that shouldn't have been said.
She's not a grower.
We're not racists," said the Post husband, Joel Placca.
'Would you trust your children when they've happened to be rude, even accidentally?'
Is thy child?
Really?"
A flavour compares the proposition to "quality" and says that his wife came up with only two months ago and was in "a very difficult situation."
"And you will persecute man in such a position?
It's quite brutal," added the expert on investment-banking activities.
While judicial investigation still continues, social thought quickly condemned married couples in social networks, evincing harsh criticism of their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Subingtan were afraid that the readers wouldn't use superpower bears that speak spoken they speak in new leaves
And the daughter of Bond Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote about the letter, "The mother put herself in the place he's read it for the first time before it's published.
So interesting to read, already aware of the huge success of Padington."
She said that her father, who had been working for BBC before she dared to write a book for children about a small toy bear, had been optimistic in spite of the fact that his work had not been accepted and had added that the 60 years of publishing the book was "cool-sweet" after he died last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success, speaking of Subingtan, whom she described as "a very important member of our family."
"He was a pretty quiet man, and quite not showy," she said.
"But as Hudgton was so real to him, it was almost parental honor for the child who made something: you're proud of them, though it isn't really your fault.
And I think that he was looking at the success of Sub-Hungton just in such a way.
While it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave it to the proper Subingtan."
My daughter died, and I had to go to her on the phone
After her daughter's landing she was brought to the hospital at Nice Louis Paste 2 where the doctors fought in vain for her life.
"On a regular basis, simply to tell me that everything is really bad, that she can't stand," said Mrs. Edn-Laperus.
"Then I called over to say that she would die for the next two minutes and I had to take her word.
And I did it.
I said, "Dad, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs which the doctors had given to her in order to be struck by her heart slowly left her body.
She had died a while ago, and this was the very end.
I simply had to sit there knowing that things had unfolded there.
And I couldn't groan, I couldn't shout, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, because there were families and people around me.
I should have held up."
At last, Mistress Edn-Lapers, who had suffered the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with her other passengers--and they did not know at all what was going on.
"No one knew," she said.
"I tilted my head and kept my face flowing with tears.
It's hard to explain, but it is in flight that I'm fascinated by the feeling of Ned's sympathy.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he liked her."
Women who feel sad hang cards to prevent suicides on the foundation
Two women, who have lost their loved ones in suicide, are doing everything they can to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphres are hanging on to the warm words and phone numbers that people can get help at, on the bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and in 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel like I do," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old, said that her son was a gifted florid with an contagious smile.
"EVERYONE knew his smile.
People used to say that his smile would light up any room."
But before he died he quit his job, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that this might get a nasty kickback."
Mistress Davis created cards, "to have people know that the world has people you can address and talk to, even if that's a friend.
Don't stay in silence--you need to talk."
Mistress Hasfries, who for many years has had a friend of Mistress Davis, lost Mark, her partner, who lived with her for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say that he was dull, or that he was in a depression, or whatever," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On a holiday day he was very excited: when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them."
She said that his death was for their great May, but one had to live with this, 'The family has got a huge hole.'
It's just killing us.
But we must go on living and fighting."

The future Breta Kavano is in doubt, because the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought we might have something that he wanted--limited in time and enumerated in the investigation--we could get a little union," said Saturday to Mr. Flake, adding that his anxiety was that the comet was "relected" because of what actually got into the traffic.
Why did Mr. Cavanaugh and his republican followers not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is sometimes explained.
The periodic elections are only five weeks from now, on 6 November -- when it is expected that the republics will suffer from paralysis -- then they will be weakened in their attempts to obtain the candidate in the upper court.
George Bush called in the senator to oversee the support of Mr. Cavanaugh, who was working in the White House during the Bush presidency and through his acquaintance with his wife Ashley, who was then working for the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
And there's a vote in the Senate where we now have 51 republics and 49 democracies.
It isn't clear yet whether or not Mr. Kavano will get 50 votes in the vote in the Senate, which will allow Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the problem of equality of votes and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of bitmaps from North Korea showed up in the course of the Kim
The number of retreats from North Korea to South Korea went down since the time that Kim Cheng Eun came to power seven years ago, declared a South Korean official.
Park Bo Soon, coming from the Ministry of South Korea United States, stated that there were 1,127 fugitives last year and 2,706 in 2011.
Pope Park stated that the main reasons for this are the strong control in between North Korea and China and the higher costs that have been set by the smugglers for the trans-shipment.
Pennyn didn't predict it at all.
Most of the flight was north with why South Korea's citizens get civilisation.
Seoul stated that over 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people run through China, which has the longest limit in North Korea, and it's more likely to go than the Demilitarized Area (DMM) between the two Koreas, which is really closeed.
China views movements as illegal migrants, not refugees and is often forced to repatriate them.
The relationship between the north and the south--which technically is still in the state of war- -has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month the leaders of the two countries met in P'enanya for talks that were experiencing denuclearization.
This occurred after the historical meeting of the United States President Donald Trump and Kim Chenn Eun in June in Singapore when they agreed to a working term in order to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Rie Jan Ho, accused American sanctions in the absence of progress since then.
"No confidence in the US will have any confidence in our national security, and in such a situation we're not going to disarm the first," said Mr. Ree in a speech to the AU General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozy called Breta Cavanaugh's "steric," she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court of
And the minority leader in the palace, Nancy Pelozy, he called the candidate in the Breta Kavano Upper Court "steric" and said that he was not allowed to work at the top court.
Pelozie said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Athens, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the thought that if she were to behave like that, she would be called "steretic," said Pelozie, regarding her reaction to the Cavanaugh speech before the Juridical Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
It was the ethically accused sexual harassment of Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were still a teenager.
During his opening speech, Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even shouting and couldn't talk when his family and high school classes were discussed.
He also clearly accused the democrats in the comet of calling his "grass and organized murder"- -organized by the liberals, who were angry at the fact that Hilary Clinton lost the Presidential elections of 2016.
He said that he thought the speech Kavano showed that he couldn't work at the Supreme Court because it clearly showed that he was a prejudice against democracy.
"I believe he has disqualified himself with his statements and in what manner he spoke about Clinton and the democrats," she said.
The client said it when she was asked whether she would try impeaching Covano, when she was chosen, and when the democrats get most of it in the House of Licensors.
"I will say so--when he doesn't speak the truth in Congress or the FBI, he not only needs to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelozie.
At the moment, Cavanaugh is a judge of the Colombian District Court of Appeal.
Pelozi added that as a member of the democratic party she was alarmed by Kavano's potential decisions against the law of accessible medicine or in the case of Rowe v. Wade because Kavano is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing of the confirmed sentence on sentence Cavanaugh, he did not answer the questions whether or not he would undo some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for experimental, insensitive people to work in court and to wait on us to say "how wonderful," said Peloz.
And the woman must know that.
It's an justified prosecution speech, months and years of anger just being translated out, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We cry when we get angry," 45 years ago, told me, Mrs. Steine.
"I don't think it's such a rareness."
So she said, "I got a very helpful woman who was working for me somewhere, and she said, "You know, when I got angry, I cry, but she did technology, and when she got angry and she started crying, she said, "Perhaps you think I'm sad, because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And just continued the conversation.
I believe it was excellent."
Tears are allowed in part as the way out the grief, for they are absolutely mistaken.
One of the brightest memories of my first work, at which I once cried for unerring anger, then caught me by a collar took an elderly woman-- a restrained boss, who always gave me a little fright--and dragged me to the east.
"Never allow yourself to be seen in tears," she said.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They think that thee sad and happy that led thee."
Patricia Srodar, who was a government democrat in Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart in the Presidential Company.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt was paltained on a matériel called the Monkey Business and came out of the Presidential race, she was very angry about the fact that she could also be part of the Presidential Company.
'It wasn't a very well-thought-out decision,' she said to me 30 years later.
"There have already been seven other candidates, and they don't need me at all.
Someone called the incident "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had gone on for quite some time, she did not have enough funds, so she said she would not take part in the elections if she didn't get two million dollars.
It was a fun situation.
It turns out that some of her followers, who had sacrificed $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"They think I'm coming with a rod?" she thought.
When she made the statement that she would not be part of the election company, she was so excited about the emotions--thanks to the people who supported her, for the anger on the system that so made it so difficult to get money and directed at the voters, not the candidates, and for the anger she had at the sexist--she was seized with her breath.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mistress Srodard's reaction to the press upon her condition.
"You could have thought my corporate sugar daddy was the manufacturer of Kleenex's paper serviettes.
I used to think that they were writing on my becomess rock?
"She's crying?"
Why the trade war between China and the United States can be good for Beijing
The first bulls of trade war between China and the United States were obscenity, and because war is far from end, there's a far-reaching prospect of misunderstanding between countries being in the favor of Beijing, says the experts.
The US president Donald Trump shot the first warning at the beginning of this year with a tax on the principal Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest escalation took place this week when the new fares affected a total of 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds) of goods that came in the US with China.
Each time Beijing responded in this way by raising the fares from five recently to ten percent for American goods at a cost of 60 billion dollars.
China has a three-man answer, and the second one on the economy can hardly bring out.
To get Washington to retreat, you need to go into the demand, but the public slope in front of the U.S. is practically unacceptable to the Chinese leader C. C. C. Cinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing properly uses the situation, the pressure of the United States trade war in the long run can support China by reducing the interdependence of the two countries.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will begin with a sudden economic contraction is much more dangerous than observers thought before," stated Abigail Grace, a research assistant in Asia, as part of the research centre of the new American security.
Serbia "gasp" to refugee return, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Serbia declares that they are willing to return refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country that has been destroyed by war and has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the AAN General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Valid Al-Mualom, said the conditions in the country are improving.
"As of today, the situation in the country is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in combating terror," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to return to normal life.
Now we have all conditions for returning refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terror and directed economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN claims to have left the country over 5.5 million Syrians since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are six million more people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would happily help to rebuild an destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that the country will not be assisted in exchanging for certain conditions or assistance from countries that have sponsored cartoons.
Europe beat the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Cup to Ryder, defeating an American team with a leading number 16.5 to 10.5 in the field of Le Golf National, in the middle of Paris, France.
The United States has already lost the sixth in a row on European soil, and it has not won the Ryder cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe had crowned when the Dutch captain Thomas Byrne had reached the 14.5 percent mark necessary to win the U.S. war.
And the American star, Phil Michaelson, who was most likely fighting a tournament, put his ball in the water by the third pair of the 16th Holes, leading the way to this match between Francesco Malinari and the United States.
The Italian golfist Malinari was doing a great job of playing all round at being one of the four players who got through this field with a number of 5-0-0-0 from the beginning of the current tunnel in 1979.
American Jordan Schpee was shot with a number 5 and 4 by the lowest rating on the European team, Thornburn Olsen, from Denmark.
The finest player in the world was Dastin Johnson, who lost 2 and 1 Ian Paulter from England, who might have been playing in his last Ryder cup.
The animal of eight Rydar cups to the Spanish, Sergio Garcia, has become a player that has more than 25.5 point beats at a tournament.
"Of course I don't cry, but I can't hold back today.
It was a difficult year.
And I'm very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to get the cup back.
It's a team thing, and I'm glad I could help it," said the startled Garcia after the European team win.
He handed the festival to his native, John Ram, who, on Sunday, won the legend of American golfman Tiger Woods in solitary match 2&1.
"I'm very proud that I played Tiger Woods, a man who's been since he was a child," said Ram 23-year-old.
Woods lost all four of his mats in France and now has the highest number 13-21-3 in Ryder's cube.
And this is a strange statistics- -that is one of the biggest players in all time, who has won 14 major titles and who has lagged behind just in that direction by Jack Niclovs.
The American team fought with it except for Patrick Read, Justin Thomas and Tony Finn who played all over the tournament of high-quality golf.
American captain Jim Fury said, after a disappointing game in defense of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're a fighter.
This morning we've sometimes indicated to Europe what we can do.
We were fighting.
Take off your hat after Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of its players were very good.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the golf Association of America and our commission of the Ryder Cup, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud that I'm their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We've been played."
Red Line Information: The concentration changes in Pinelles, Manat and Sarascots
The most recent report from the Florida Committee on the Conservation of Fish and Wild Animals shows a general lowering of the concentration of "red tide" in some parts of Tampe Bay.
Well, according to the committee's information, there's a reason to happen specifically in the districts of Pinelas, Manat, Sarasta, Charlotte, and Calle, which is to say that this is to do a decrease in concentration.
The values of the red tide are moving at about 130 miles (200 km) from the northern part of the district of Pinelas to the southern part of the Li district.
Drills of fiction can be found about 10 miles (15 km) from the shore in the Hillsbar district, but as compared to the past week, the number has dropped.
The red tide was also seen in the Pasca district.
The middle size concentration on the shore or near shore in the district of Pinelas was observed last week, and in Hilsbar the concentration was from low to high. In Manati concerning the background to high, on the bank, or the close shore in the district of Sarato concentration was from background to high, in Charlotte district from background to middle, on the shore or close shore in the Lee district from background to high point, and in the Kale district the low concentration.
Annoyance is reported from the district of Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee, and Kale.
Last week there were no messages of airstorming from Florida's Northwest.
