Republic Strategy for Resistance to the Reelection of Obama
The Republican leaders justified their policies to combat the falsification of elections.
However, Brennan’s Centre considers the latter to be a myth, claiming that electoral frauds in the United States are more rare than those caused by lightning.
Moreover, Republican lawyers have only counted 300 cases of selective falsification in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In that sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the US.
That is why most state Governments have since 2009 enacted laws that make the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon took on new dimensions following the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting voting rights in 41 states were passed in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require an elector to produce a photo identity card and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right of voter registration on the date of the declaration of will and deny the right to vote to citizens who have a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state had ordered voters to present a photo identity card.
Indiana was the first State to make such a request.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian Act.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated legislation requiring voters to present identity cards with photographs in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have the same universal identity card as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, or 21 million people who have reached the voting age, do not have a personal identification card with a picture issued by the state government.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have a similar document.
However, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 percent of African-Americans, 15 percent of people earn less than $35,000, 18 percent of citizens over 65 and 20 percent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required identity card.
But that's not all.
Voter students who are believed to vote for democratic candidates are not permitted in several states to use a photo identity card issued by their educational institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, which vote mainly for Republicans, to use the permits issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required proof of American citizenship for voting.
For the first time, a similar requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the vote of Latin American people.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, republican legislators initiated laws in 2011 to abolish voter registration on voting day in eight states.
They have also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This limitation did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
However, measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17 per cent drop in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republic legislators have enacted legislation in five other states aimed at reducing the early voting period.
In the 2008 general election in Florida, for example, 33 per cent of early voters were African Americans, although the latter represented only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters.
The same happened to Latin Americans.
They represented only 11 per cent of the voters, 24 per cent of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, who formed 76 per cent of voters, only 46 per cent of voters were early.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws were passed by democratic governors.
The most controversial laws have been suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has partially limited the negative effects.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted legislation requiring the production of a photo identity card.
However, the new rules that have come into effect would certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics from democracies condemn the biases of laws that have been enacted, seeing them as a clear focus on influencing the 2012 elections in key states.
The Brennan Centre report of 2011 shows that the States that have enacted these laws represent 171 out of 270 votes required by the panel of electors to win the presidential election.
It is too early to assert with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
There is no doubt that these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In that sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Pre-natal cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the PAS test sometimes produces false, false, and sometimes false, which leads to useless medical interventions.
Men and men who are reluctant to undergo a dispersal, have more to doubt.
To pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
Studies in the United States have shown many cases of infection among the research teams, making the data difficult to interpret and difficult to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different levels of mortality among those patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastasis is 30 to 40 per cent higher for those who have not received screening.
So I'd recommend a test from age 50, or 40 if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at greater risk.
The key point is making the right decision as soon as cancer is found.
Cancer can be both aggressive and virulent.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering options, without compulsory treatment for prostate cancer, which does not pose a risk to life in the long run, but chooses, in these cases, to actively monitor the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is neither aggressive nor life threatening.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
More and more, we have accurately determined the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I'd recommend you pass the test.
But it is also important to consult your doctor in order to determine whether this test is necessary or not.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Mowemberg has created a tool to assess all the benefits and the negative effects of the PAA test.

Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, healthy living remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
If all people were well fed and moved enough, 30 per cent of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If no one else smoked, that figure would have increased to at least 50%,” says André Bolier, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are due to inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85 per cent of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It has caused tremendous damage to human health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says Spokesperson André Bolier.
It is encouraging to know that 10 years after refusing to smoke, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
Data from the Central African Republic indicate that overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat and direct intestines, stomachs, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity over the course of a lifetime protects from intestinal cancer” is added to the Association.
Food
The Association also recommends that red meat consumption be limited.
It increases the risk of intestinal cancer in too many quantities.
Collabic products should also be avoided.
Reservation of meat by digging, drying or salinity may result in the production of canceric substances.
"The latter may harm the body cells and lead to cancer development," explained the Association.
Vitamines
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But the results of these studies are not clear at the moment.
According to SCC, vitamin E research produces conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other did the opposite.
The assessment of the impact of vitamin D cancer on development is also unclear.
However, he stressed that it was important to discuss their concerns and family anaemones with the doctor.
"It doesn't lead to cancer."
Higgs Boson in detail
In the past summer, the report that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs Boson has given rise to real violence — and not without cause.
This boson is believed to explain the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
Moreover, this is the last particle that was predicted to exist within the framework of the Standard Model -- our best, or, in any case, the “less imperfect” description of nature and the conduct of matter -- but that was previously not detected by experience.
But physicists are not yet fully convinced that this is the Higgs boson.
We know there's no doubt that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it's very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, the new data provided this week at one major physical convention in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
Let's imagine, though, that this is the Higgs Boson, because the chances of error seem minimal, and let's see what it means.
There is one law in this world that is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There's no way around this rule, not even try too hard, or hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that there is one law of a similar nature: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which would argue that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same moment if they are in the same "quatant state" is, in general, a "state" in some of their characteristics.
Therefore, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called Feriones, who wisely conform to the principle of Pauli.
On the other hand, there are bosons, a despicable band of anarchists, who have no respect for at least this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
As reported by the site (by the way, an unusual part) of the Burkley Laboratory, these bosons are divided into two groups: the mezons we will not talk about here, and the “part of the force” through which the major forces of nature are spread and to which some of the Higgs bosons belong.
These very bosons, it should be stressed, are not all the exotic creatures that could be thought of.
In fact, if you can read this chronica, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: photon, or "part of the world," which is the "surge" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it's breaking the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown into a pond.
It produces an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) and it is nothing more than a photon wave, and therefore one of the "force vectors".
A More Stable Field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with the only difference that for this boson to appear, it must be "breaked" by another field, the Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field is far, far more stable than an electromagnetic field; to stimulate it, very and very high energy must be achieved, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface could only shake a very large stone.
That's why a huge particle acceleration is needed, like the one that's being used in CERN, the Big Hadron Collider, which is a 27-kilometre diameter ring!
An analogy with an electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact; others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never be held on its own.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have a mass, whereas others (like photon, by the way) do not.
So, what "may" all these studies ask Mrs. Plammondon?
In science they are used to verify the accuracy of the Standard Model (SM), which also allows physicists to find a difference between observations and projections of CM.
In addition, some of them are eager to find such a difference, since the slightest discrepancy can open the door for “new physics” and close some of the holes in the Model.
The last one, I have to say, still has significant flaws without offering any explanation for gravity (ho!) or dark matter that creates about 80% of the universe.
So far, however, there have been no such differences in CERN.
Consequences
It would be more difficult to predict these studies for the average person’s daily life, but it would be a mistake to assume that he is not.
Look, early in the 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell's labs could not even have anticipated what revolution would bring about their work.
They predicted their apps in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratorys, where a laser was invented in 1960 and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the previous one) in 1962, said that the laser was originally seen as a "laboratory sludge".
Imagine...
In addition, an annex could be found for the tools accompanying the study.
The same billion Boyle, for example, developed a small light - sensor during his optical research in 1969.
This sensor, although not its original purpose, now serves as a “star” for all digital cameras of the world and deserves the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physics.
This does not mean, of course, that the work of the Greater Hadron Collider is bound to change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
The palliative aid is the best way to die... .. "Dolg."
The Commission for a Worthy Death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate should soon resume, and a bill was being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
The Dolgue tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Monterey.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed him from the inside, gave him a two-year delay.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in a bed in Victor Hadbua's palliative care shelter in Beloy, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't prepare for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents one from going to the toilet and even eating on its own.
While sitting at the table where he has an appetizing meal, he surrenders and agrees to be helped to eat.
He's awake, even smiling, talking to strangers who work around him, bringing him drugs, taking him to the bathroom.
Courage before ordinary death.
"My greatest wish to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"In the course of our lives, we are taught that a man has to pee a stand," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbua's orphanage.
To regress to the child ' s condition is an intolerable humiliation for some.
"It all depends on the ability of the human being to accept a fall," he claims.
Because, according to many palliative care workers, important events occur at the very height of the fall.
Patients who enter Victor Gadbua palliative shelter are all suffering from cancer.
Projections give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provides help called “medical”.
Ms. A., 89, was most afraid of dying “in the mind of a suffocation”.
But the disease has made it possible for me to get to know my children.
"I've got good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in my life," she says, before I let her have a mask that makes breathing easier.
She is still awaiting her son ' s last visit from Italy in the days ahead.
At Victor Gadbua, a group of volunteers are providing body care and nutrition assistance.
This is palliative care, which remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care.
That's very little, given that sooner or later we'll all die.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, as explained by Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at the orphanage.
Be comfortable physically, emotionally, or mentally.
The dying one we'll agree to give his mouth strips of brandy or pepsi, as he asks.
We don't force diabetics to control sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of the day.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died this night.
In the morning, his son finished his beer at the dead man's feet.
"We're helping our loved ones, just like the patients," says Natalie Sawar, director of nursing.
At Victor Gadbua's shelter, no one's like the previous day.
Near the 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, putting his pillows on a toast in his honor, tragically dies a young man 36 years old, surrounded by parents, wife and two small children, and trying everything to survive.
"In the last six months, three to five beds are always occupied by cancer patients under 45," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53 per cent of the patients admitted to the Victor Hadbua shelter came from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbua and the Major Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this big health gap in Quebec that makes many palliative - care doctors fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and helps them commit suicide.
Since October, the manifesto, signed by the palliative care lights, Dr. Balfur Mountain and Dr. Bernard Leafant, has been circulating and testifying to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Québec health care is not effective enough to ensure the right to high quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who had spent 14 days in an ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one had taken the necessary steps to ease them.
I'm afraid that patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
However, many oncologists have been trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Helen Richard’s prospects for survival were minimal when she stopped chemotherapy.
When I told my oncolon that I was stopping treatment, she told me she regretted that I had stopped fighting, ” she says.
And she told me that my days were numbered!
No comprehensive care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of those who ask for death are grateful to the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team has eased their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not entirely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Major Montreal Home Society, patients are vulnerable to 8 percent pain.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to a palliative seat, where the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we are unaware of these sufferings.
More and more, patients who are unable to relieve their pain will be able to access palliative seats.
Sick people suffering from pain always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want to get euthanasia", it means "I want to get easier."
The report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute for Health Research of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political party fund-raisers and specialists in the Italian Mafia report day after day what they know about the huge “system” that misleads the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafia.
The “Industry”, which cost very much to Québec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"Seriously, after the system has been launched, "Jacques Ducheno, deputy and former chief of police in Montreal" is joking.
It was thanks to it that in 2011 there was a scandal as a result of the investigation into official offences related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of the time from liberals, Jean Share, had agreed very reluctantly.
The Dusheno Report established a direct link between industry, the clandestine financing of political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stresses, the Ministry of Transport alone would have kept billions of dollars on contracts," if some had held back their instincts to take part.
The Charbon Commission “has already moved two mayors”, he adds, in the hope that it will “discover individual schemes”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, was joined by a large staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the staff of the Molott Special Unit, which after 2009 had forced Montreal's “stop-cartel” to stop over-valued contracts.
A series of searches had been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotta, a small town mayor, had been charged with fraud and corruption.
In line, Gile Wajyankur, who recently resigned as Mayor of Lavala, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of receiving bribes on several occasions when public orders are made.
In addition, several communication engineers from Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin were formally charged, including Tony Akurto and Lino Zambit.
The latter bombed a real bomb and investigated the “system” for obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambit gave 3 per cent of the value of the contracts entered into in Montreal to a Mafia-related mediator who, in turn, transferred the money of the Mer.
During the 2000s, Zambit was shot to the right and left, and he transferred over 88,000 Canadian dollars (about Euro88,000) to various provincial parties, mostly liberals then in power.
In addition, he confessed that he had illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the liberal Party of Natalie Normando.
High-value sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system worked inexorably.
Hil Surprenan, a former civil engineer, described it in detail in front of the commission: within ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts he had overstated.
Other road officials admitted that they had received 30-40 per cent or more in excess of their accounts by means of false supplements.
One mayor, Martin Dumont, then accused Mr. Trembès of deliberately closing his eyes to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party's cash pools with dirty money.
Following those revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early in November, loading Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to be alarmed.
The Mayor of the Rivier de Prairi District in the east of the island, she has opposed the sale of a 5 million dollar municipal property since 2010 and has been resold for... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a building boom.
70% of dirty money in pre-election campaigns
She said that in the investigation, which would eventually be launched, she would “stack up a thread that would make it possible to understand the functioning of an ant - infested system to stop the gangrene and to identify the perpetrators”.
This process is described as “diseased but positive”.
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid returning questionable practices.
How we clean up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Ducheno notes from his side that “the perpetrators stole hundreds of millions of dollars”, but is particularly concerned about the role of “elective officials who knew about the scheme” but who did not participate in the schemes.
Given that the share of dirty money in the financing of the electoral campaign in Quebec is 70 per cent, he's joking, "I've been told that this was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Québec proposes to limit up to $100 a donation to the parties, but he says that this will not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit election costs, politics will have dirty money.”
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of State contracts and party financing: “We can't go down below; with the brave insight of things, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Ducheno calls on those laughing to look into their own yard...
"PSW isn't Barcelona's FC!"
In this season, you're on the TFG, and you're doing an extraordinary amount of work.
How will you explain this growth?
This may be due to individual awareness, but may also be due to the new dimension of SWD.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up next to them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a great deal.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
It's happening very fast in football.
But I'm not breaking up.
From the very beginning, I have always stepped forward in the pre-training centre at the NIF in Clerphonten and until my arrival in St. Etienne.
So you benefit from the competition set up by Carlo Anchelotty...
This summer's filling up is not new to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that each training is very important.
That leads to a player like me wanting to be on a level and put it to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotty is supporting my position.
He's assisted by alternates like Claude Macelele, who played in the same position as I am.
The Anchlottes are the owners of the situation?
Of course.
The Anchelotts show respect for all technical personnel.
Today, he is not equal in the First League and is one of the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I was walking away from a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
How do you feel about part one of the PSW season?
In the First League, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is the League of Champions: we have effectively qualified for one eighth of the finals.
What's the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Everything can be from now on.
We can say our word face-to-face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, in order to be able to take a one-eighth final match.
Would PCW be able to become the first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this.
In order to become a major European club, Paris must win titles and maintain long-term positions.
It's not like that today.
Financially, PAW has the means to make this project real.
Do not take title in the First League, like last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we are truly eager to get this championship title.
Last season, we were close to this.
In May, we were disappointed because we had everything to come to the finish line first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points imply the title of the champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Even though strong teams such as Marcel, Lyon, and Bordeaux have entered the battle for title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think there's too much media waiting for the SSW?
It's normal to expect a lot of things from us, given how much money has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We're fully prepared for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua and we still find ourselves criticized, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect of us first.
We can never win every weekend with a 4-0 bill.
We're not Barcelona's FK!
We're trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the League of Champions that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who has been unable to get into one eighth of the final two seasons, although they have also spent huge sums of money!
Given the amounts invested, we represented you 15 points ahead of us by the winter break.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who had not been up in the last season, had been “excited” by this new PCJ.
It shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we won.
The SWF seems to be entirely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
Well, what if they say there's some "Late Independence" thing.
It simply means that Ibrahimovich is very successful and that he kills a lot of people.
He came for this and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Wherever he played, he showed that he was a big player and a world-wide star.
In the group we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
It stimulates others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive the Euro-2012 with the French?
That's disappointing.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from breaking up some playtime.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out of there stronger.
Today I'm able to play good match games.
That's what I've hoped since I was baptized at Blue's.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschama, headed by the Blue?
They're good for him.
He has a good position in the selection group for the world championship.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players, and he's inspired to win.
What was Laurent Blance like?
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blance achieved his goal by qualifying us for Euro.
I hope Didier Descham brings the Blue to Brazil.
A well-deserved nobody (1-1), torn out on 16 October in Spain, is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, my career wasn't like a match.
Pay and sell without banks - with Bitcoin
Full contrast to the current monetary exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between receiving parties with commissions to process them.
Moreover, as often as these technologies happen, the political vision is clear: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (psychedon), is both a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros...) and a secure protocol for the exchange of files between participants at the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand sites use bitumen for donations or as a payment.
The quote rate, reaching a maximum of $30 (Euro23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning today to about ten dollars (the rate is shown on the bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in the system in its report on the virtual currency published in October.
He describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “concursing with a dollar or a euro” and “like ordinary currencies”.
It is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to advance video games that are earned in the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But exchange operations always control and process a central authority.
In Bitkoin, all nodes in the network are simultaneously book holders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two e-mail addresses, like an e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitumen used in the transaction does exist in a public ledger distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in the book.
It goes through a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like an interim central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
This is the hashing phase of a file, i. e. converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers take a new transaction and add a number to it before "hash" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will produce a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be indissolublely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If the user wanted to pay twice as quickly (less than 10 minutes) for the purpose of deception, only one of the two transactions would be confirmed by the network and the other would remain unconfirmed because they had different electronic signatures.
A computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoons.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize is distributed in half, possibly by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoons in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they're divided into one hundredmillion, which leaves another reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with increased computing capacity.
The network's life has already gone through the ups and downs.
Bitcoin service sites have been attacked and bitcoons have been stolen from reserves.
“The defect in use is not related to the protocol itself”, assures Pierre Nuaza, who has recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this shortcoming.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, are allowed.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel analysed the ledger and found that almost 80 per cent of the bitcoons were not in circulation.
"The Giant Sales" was announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," is John Holmkwist, who works at Coinabul, who is working to convert the bitikons into gold.
Pierre Nouaza, another author of this currency's allowance, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or a direct payment through a mobile phone, but it uses bitcoin to verify transactions, which is cheaper.
The holder is better able to control his identity and may thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is only sufficient to provide an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by telephone, as told by Pierre Nouaz, who has already had thousands of users.
There is a general trend towards the revision of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"Before the Beatcoin stands up, it's going to be some time, but 2013 can be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB report, by the way, intends to review the various risks considered to be increased today if the system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French forces left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans should follow them in late 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future without hoping for us alone.
We have suffered mainly from Afghan peasants, whom we viewed as terrorists.
And we are, with 88 soldiers killed and wounded and injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They're tolerated, sometimes helped by local rebels, but they'll be gone as soon as the West gets more sensitive.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills of the almond trees through French loans, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul by the end of 2014.
The situation has changed from the time of their overwhelming progress from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, and the country was in fire and blood because of fighting between the various factions.
Their taking control of the country was then seen as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the darkness of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved in our time.
The former mujahedes, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in subjection.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They became dealers of state land to resold them to returnees who had returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge United States subcontracts.
They're discredited; most of them didn't even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in rural areas, want a government that was not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as do those who have been successful in American generosity: capital outflows.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world when they were expelled from Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
State schools in urban areas are filled with boys and girls alike.
There is a need to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the darkness of old parties or corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the world today and which are watching everywhere.
There is an army at the moment.
The authorities that will command her will be considered legitimate?
Old commanders in the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to rebuild provincial wives who would not be subject to central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to some extent, as in the case of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized State with strong presidential power by abolishing the post of Prime Minister, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country had been dependent on foreign assistance since the 1950s and even earlier.
The industry was not put on its feet, no dam was functioning and no irrigation system was repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruit.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by the thirty years of war, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the sense that Western countries were present only to take possession of them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transport to export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Ainak Med site, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up an enormous Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, re-establish normal relations on one fine day.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: lykes for girls, for boys, French Faculty at the university, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and support for an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “conquer hearts and minds” and carry out the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the Ministry of Defence's “military-civil activities” service, which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French social organization, has contributed to numerous community and agricultural rehabilitation activities in dozens of mountain villages.
These efforts, with the intensive involvement of local workers, have helped to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest rehabilitation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of arable land.
What will we remember by spending two billion euros on military expenditures?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of the local population, which are very severe in these valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work originating from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To get rid of the rebellions led by foreign groups, which farmers, as they told me, need to provide them with little non-military support, which would have been a good control over and approach them directly.
Heavy lines of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky step by President Mohammed Murcy.
While Egypt is divided more than ever on the question of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, it has decided to play the wa bank.
He announced on Wednesday that the Constitutive Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two extra months to complete the work.
Soon after, Egypt has relied on a preliminary text that has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his “automatic falsehood” by continuing to “break up the word” and “reproach the right”.
In his camp, his followers were convinced that it was a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that causes the brothers to abandon their intention to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
It is also a means for the President to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsey seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since the call for an accelerated vote is based on the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: “Either you vote in favour of my text or I leave an extraordinary power”, which is expected to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constitutive Assembly, most of them Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they were slamming the door, feeling unable to communicate their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the required quorum, 11 persons, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, were distracted by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day had arisen around... the time for prayer, since some committee members had felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were not well tuned.
The text on which the vote was still in progress yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The subject of universal attention, article 2 finally remained the same as in the 1971 Constitution, which stated that “the principles of the Sharia are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law was a basic requirement, had hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would make it possible to apply them more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Licerce," say liberals, who see it only as a piano.
Because, in their view, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, particularly with regard to the verification of the conformity of Shariah law.
According to Egypt’s expert, Sofia Pomie, this is alarming, that “people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can observe the beginning of the theocracy."
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the university’s next Rector is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
"At present, there is no specific religious interference.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulemas, but university students, some have been trained in the French system,” calms Alexis Blue, who prepares the dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “the scope of article 220 may be ambiguous, as the terms used therein are drawn from religious language.
This applies in particular to “fix” [Islamic jurisprudence, if applicable].
In the future, the question may arise as to how competent civilian judges are to decide.”
In addition to its religious dimension, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly reduced compared to the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will not be considered in Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
Nor would the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests by human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about a text that they consider destructive to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy has been maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles ever speak of protecting a woman, according to Heba Moreaf, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State, in turn, will go out on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, Pup of the Earth and sea of brine
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, the present - day comfort, and the primordial nature.
AIF has identified five of the most important reasons why we should visit Israel.
Worshiping Holy Places
It is good to visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all who enter this “buyer ” enjoy God’s favor.
And Galileo is the place of Jesus ’ miracles: turning water into wine, water, storm relief, and networking.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But the most holy place in Jerusalem.
Believers are passing through the Scorby or the Cross Pathway of Jesus (latin - Via Doloroz).
It begins at the stronghold of Antonia - Pretoria, where there was a trial, and in the streets of the Old City, it is brought to the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, to the site of Raspitia, the Stone of Anointed One, and the place of burial of Jesus.
Here, too, is the symbolic Christian Pup of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is erected in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which it was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jews, the Stan of Placha, who was left behind by the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different denominations leave notes of wishes here that are then fulfilled.
Make a vertical journey
The ruins of Massad's fortress remained from a secret place of refuge from the enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on cliffs in the mountains at a height of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who get involved in mountaineers can reach them.
The rest of us to this historic peak are carrying the lift on the rope road.
In the north of the country, the famous Hermon ski resort is at an altitude of 1,600 to 2040 metres, with a huge influx of tourists during the winter months.
A shuttle bus comes to him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski roads is 45 km.
Ancient tradition claimed that pagan gods lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
About 300 museums in this country.
You're not going to all of them for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Jewish Desert and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth visiting the Arts Museum in Tel Aviv.
His exhibits include the impressionist and expressionist paintings of Mone, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sileia, Matisse, Modilian, Chagala, Picasso.
It is possible to visit the Al-Basha Museum in Akko, which is a number of rooms of ancient Turkish baths with museums of visitors and banisters of the time.
In Cesaria, we should go to the unique private Museum of Rally, where we can enjoy the Daly and Roden sculptures.
There's no tour guides and gift shop.
The entrance is free, and donations are not accepted categorically.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or the Jade of Yours in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the Children's Memorial, is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas cells.
You go into it, and you end up in perfect darkness.
Stars die.
The names of the Jewish children and those of the countries in which they were killed are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Healing
The three main Israel resort zones are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each has basins, aquatics, dolphins, and marines.
Interestingly, even in the winter months, the Red Sea is bathed because the temperature of the water does not drop below 20 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air warms to about 30 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C.].
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and there's a year-long bath.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point on the planet - 417 m below sea level.
The lacquoise water in it is a raffle that is easily floating without even being able to swim at all.
The performances around them are incredibly beautiful.
They go here to get treatment with salty water - rapa, and whole - grain dirt, and to treat the health of dermatites, allergies, asthma, exemas, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar diabetes, to get the nerves in order.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquities
They are kept by the ancient Tel Aviv, a town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it was the famous Maritime Way, which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
It is said that it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
The tourists love to dress on narrow streets named after Zodiac’s signs.
They say if you touch the walls of your "your" sign on the street, Fortuna will be favorable.
In Jaffa, young people from all over Israel, and even from other countries, can be met at a photo session.
And in Cesarius, the city of King Herod, you can wander around the Roman theater, "take" the fortresses of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Cesarios was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
A carefully renovated theater is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
A Visit to a Note
When you go to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population knows Russian.
It's better to take the money for travel in dollars instead of euros, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekel).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and Haifa is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations linking the Lower City to the Upper City.
In fact, it's an underground dysculler.
All modes of urban transport cost six shekels and can be transported for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, sabat is a Jewish custom on the Sabbath.
From Friday night till sunset Saturday, markets, shops, public transportation are terminated.
And Sunday morning begins the working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only cosher food excluding pork, seafood, free fish, and meat and meat.
It offers a wide range of meats from lambs and beefs, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste humus, a variety of sauces, raspberries, phalalal, fruit, and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fattened cats that play on their own.
In the evening they are seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The ants love human habitats and do not give up food.
Rental of the vehicle, depending on the mark, will cost between $37 and 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) a day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And it's going to cost 15 sheaves a day.
The museum tickets are 30 shekels on average.
The language of the digits
In 2012, over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
The United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine were among the greatest visitors to travel and rest.
From January to October 2012, 111,800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Earth of the Promised Land, 51 per cent more than in 2010, before the abolition of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Great and Mighty" to Moscow will lead the migrants to save money in the language
As long as deputies and human rights defenders argue that a law on compulsory language testing has been issued, fraudsters have already appeared in the country trading July certificates.
Each year, 13 million gasters arrive in Moscow, Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only objective is to earn money to support families in their homeland.
As of 1 December, a law had entered into force requiring each migrant worker to pass the Russian language test.
For the time being, this rule is applicable only to those who intend to work in the areas of services, housing and utilities, welfare and retail trade.
In time, however, the FMS promises, the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Not only the language, but also Russian history, and the basis of legislation, will have to be given.
The knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed for both obtaining and extending work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is a State language.
Nor are people able to obtain diplomas and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, obsolescence and protection of rights
The Network of Examination Points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, IHM, SBGU and other Russian universities.
Migrants could pass tests in all cities; already more than 160 such centres had been opened in Russia.
Both Statelors and FMS supported the introduction of the testing initiative.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have been able to ask the press many times: What does that actually mean?
What will make learning the language binding for both Russians and visitors?
First of all, the migration service responds, which will reduce the number of people who suffer from “labour slavery”.
Very many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, as explained by Victor Semlev, head of the Russian Federation's Mission in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system would solve the problems of foreign workers by 90 per cent.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, education, language, medical examination.
Without understanding the language, I am sure Saslev, a future migrant is doomed to encounter dishonest people who, under the aid of a way, will put him into a terrible, close barracks, where he and dozens of them will spend months without food or documents, throwing 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“They are promised one thing in their homeland and are deceived when they arrive, pick up their passports, and do not pay their promised salary”, confirms the Head of the General Directorate of Labour Migration of the IPU of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharip.
Don't worry about it, bugger!
Nevertheless, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are going to make a living in Russia recognize that they are not only ignorant of the language of the country they are seeking, they are writing hard on their own.
Of course, it's not so much their fault as their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even an intelligent primary education.
Their families have nothing to do with feeding their children, let alone wear them, dress them, and equip them for school.
As young people grow up, they go to work at the earliest opportunity.
It is difficult, if they are ignorant of the tongue, for they are admitted.
"You feel humiliated and inadequate."
True, with regard to the Law on Language, human rights defenders have noted one important point.
The test will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent formal work.
Meanwhile, most of the gasters still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or the Outside Entrance is prohibited."
Many of the visitors argue that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The cause is bureaucratic obstacles and the same linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs between 12,000 and 16,000 rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and in just one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, no registrations, no cases of extortion.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea" shared with journalists a citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushudamov.
"Come on, don't squirt, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Law, it became clear that there were more than only migrants ' registration documents.
Several “smart” language test certificates have already been withdrawn by FMS staff.
Fake paper is printed on a typical colour printer.
Of course, the new owners were not free: each of the migrants who hoped to make it easier for himself to pass the tests paid 7,000 roubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of formal testing: it would cost three thousand workers.
That the main challenge for the short term was to protect the system from corruption, so that the “goats” could not be bought, whether by the authorities or human rights defenders.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise to keep the first test time out of the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian visitors will be offered work in areas that do not involve active contact with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not trade illegal arms markets
The proportion of legal offences is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation proposes to tighten the law on owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: to shoot shots at weddings without victims, and to the massacre by Moscow's lawyer, Dimitri Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
Police officers want to prohibit the use of injury in public places and raise the age from which a weapons licence can be obtained, from 18 to 21.
The head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarovai, supported the idea and promised that the Weapons Act would be amended in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by “circling the hack”.
An open letter emerged on the network, whose authors - representatives of various community-based small organizations - demanded that the “unreasonable tightening” be abandoned.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, according to the BBC Russian Service, a criminal lawyer, Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs statistics, 142 firearms crimes registered with the internal affairs authorities were committed in six months of 2012, while 1,168,000 crimes were reported during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of legislation on civilian weapons does not prevent the offender from entering the black market.
They said that any weapon could now be found in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to control the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Vendors, from factories to officers
The Black Arms Market is being complemented by several channels.
Five of these main channels are reported by a retired Colonel, Victor Baranc, who has worked for 10 years in the Ministry of Education and Genstabe.
Screening of the weapons order site
The first is an “army or military trail”, that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were dragged both by Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves," says Baranc.
The next type of "black weapon" is stolen from members of the security forces by criminals.
Baranc explains that these include those taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns are being sold off military stores.
Many military warehouses were frequently bombed.
"There are proven cases that part of the burning has been done specifically to cover up the shortage," says the former military.
According to Baranc, weapons manufacturers are contributing their contributions.
“Secretly private arms factories are producing, which do not withstand competition on the international market and throw weapons out of the floor into the black market, including Moscow,” the expert explains.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
In particular, guns and assault rifles from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, are being used.
"There's its own production, sometimes handicraft, and there's a Mafia that organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where's the gun from?
The experts considered the approximate proportion of each source of illicit arms to the black market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
Experts have analysed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open weapons portals.
Most of the illegal weapons, researchers write, come from the army and the security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market were “the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons”, says the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from areas of armed conflict, 14 per cent are stolen during the arms production phase, and 5 per cent are from “black archaeology”.
A consulting seller at one of the arms stores who asked not to give his name assures me that the weapons found by the black digters have been gone for a long time without anyone buying - too old.
Most of the time, he says, a new shipment of vendors is going to a military warehouse.
A person buys a unit through a flagger, such as a TT gun.
They e-mail it to him, they pass it through the fence.
"He's transporting her to town and here he sells Euro900 a piece with two shops," he says.
“It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so, on occasion, when a crime detection plan is on fire, it is responsible for the control procurement of illegal weapons from traffickers,” adds the consultant.
"As in a luxury store."
The seller and buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I've been checking websites, blogs, until there's a friend who wants to come to God's platform where there's someone who's gonna take me to the corner where we're going to be trading.
I only knew the price of the gun there.
Military observer Victor Baranc
To get the gun, I need a friend who has a way out, says a consultant seller.
The salesmen are on the market, but they also have to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanović who asked me to tell her she had a tooth."
I'm even getting a couple of castes right now through a person I'm sure of.
He's giving them to me, too, because he knows I won't give them up.
The newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Barantec tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s as he prepared an article on this subject for publication.
Schemes, he said, have not changed.
They gave him an album with photos where "anything" was.
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalled the military.
The customer, as Barantz says, doesn't offer a cat in a bag -- everything can be tried.
I'm a potential client, not just buying -- we're going to the woods with the seller, where we're targeting.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I'm sure the weapons are good, we're starting to trade," the expert describes the procedure.
A store on the couch
Internet searches are posted on Web sites and groups at Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No papers or personal meetings are needed to do so.

The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of front-line sites willing to buy war weapons with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish at the base, and then they get coal in Siberia.

I have heard of such schemes: the site is usually registered outside the limits of Russian law.
People accept orders.
The buyer makes payments through the ATM.
“In response, a photograph and a instruction note are sent, where weapons are hidden,” says the spokesman of the public organization entitled “Right to arms” by Dimitri Kislov.
Victor Barantec claims that by leaving the application on the website, you can go without weapons and get in jail.

Experts estimate that between $100 and $900 can be invested in the purchase of illicit small arms.
According to Dimitri Kislov of the Right to Weapons organization, Makarov's gun can be purchased for $100-300.

According to the official statistics of the agency, the total number of such offences in Russia fell by 7 per cent from January to October 2011, to 22,900, and the number of reported thefts and extortions of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, fast food workers and supermarkets are being found
As many as a quarter of all American teenagers pass through the Maddonalds.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in the department of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food networks such as Maddonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendes and Kentukki Freud Chiken.
As long as no one is willing to predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth shaft or whether it is intended to suffocate at an early stage.
Actions support trade unions and a number of left-wing voluntary organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries of ordinary employees of Walmart and fast food systems, the aim of protest workers is to establish trade union organizations.
As yet, this sector of the economy is hardly covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The shares started last week, after Thanksgiving, on a so-called Black Friday, when the U.S. was hit by an orgy of cheap sales that took millions of people and sometimes had a stroke.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picketed with trade unions and left-wing activists the company ' s stores, whose goods are counted on people of modest and moderate wealth.
Walmart trades everything in the world, from pews, hunting guns and automobile batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Food in its stores is on average between 8 and 27 per cent cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid employees of Walmart are only off-the-job workers.
Accessibility and product range have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods at low cost, partly because he pays little to his employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of trucks or hand-held scanners.
The shareholders at Black Friday demanded salary increases and netted that the cost of the corporation's health insurance went from $30 per month to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart worker who gets $9.5 an hour, that's not the cost of his pocket, they said.
Researchers at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises average wages to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1% more than she's spending on wages right now.
If Walmart's entirely relegated salary increases to customers' shoulders, each trip to the store will cost him only 46 cents more.
They'll spend 12.39 more dollars a year than they do now.
Walmart’s supporters point out quite well that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any damage to the corporation.
Black Friday continued in her stores from 8 a.m. Thursday to midnight the following day, and Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of almost 100 million transactions were made by its cashiers on Black Friday.
The representative of Dan Fogelman, in an interview with the left-hand Huffington Post, argued that the jobs had been abandoned by a total of “less than five” Walmart employees, and that the protest was merely a “other Piarov trick” by the organization of the union.
"Free cash!"
Protests continued this week in New York City, where they were targeted not by Walmart's department (which is not the case in this progressive city and therefore not yet here) but by Madonalds and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even give you hospitalization and pay you an honest job!
Jumain Williams, New York City Hall Member
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
The fast food restaurants increase it over time, but not much, and on average, their employees receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
No one earns less in this expensive city.
I don't know how to live in New York for that kind of money.
Once, the Maddonalds had nearly a quarter of American teenagers working for their counters after school while living with their parents.
Few people have seen this main source of food or have planned to stay there for a long time.
Right now, I'm constantly faced with interviews with Maddonalds employees who complain that they should live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
The Wall Street Journal, on the other hand, has a comment in its forum, and the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them.
The protestors, who began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday morning at Maddonalds in 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and the fast food supplies start paying at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum earnings.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the area of fast food.
American law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing trade unionists with acts and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
But it is also difficult to reach out to fast food unions for objective reasons.
One of the main things is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
Dissenting
Noise protests took place on that day and at several other low-cost Manhattan restaurants.
At the middle of the day, the Maddonalds rally near the Times Square was climaxed by several local democrat politicians, in particular a member of the Jumain Williams Hillary, who said, "Macdonalds" says he sells billions of servings and then he doesn't even give you hospital treatments or pay you an honest job."
Other prominent New York democracies, for example, were supported by the demonstrators as a mayor of the city of Bill De Blacio, who stated that “we must be friendly in supporting the fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.”
As described by the New York Times, this was the largest such activity in the history of the American field of fast nutrition.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were working in the fast-moving hospital, where tens of thousands of people are employed in New York City.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will produce a mass-traffic flame.
"As long as you're cheating your brain, you're getting middle."
A popular topic of modern technology, supplemented by reality, has recently been accepted mainly through the use of special points.
First in the summer, Google showed the current model at its annual conference, and then in November, it became known that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it follows from a discussion with a team leader of interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft Sharam Izadi Cambridge Laboratory that for the scientists of this company, the glasses were a stage.
They have the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell me what your research team is doing.
- We're working on human interaction with machines, but we're trying to open up the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as the mass of humanity is stuck at the point of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes titans in them.
We want to look 5 to 10 years forward and anticipate major changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect, because all are interested in sign control.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has moved interaction to physical level, much is still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information input has improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion is not yet very good.
We're trying to change it, and we're working on true three-dimensional display systems based on a variety of technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more comfortable manner.
And above all, those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
A popular thing, but don't they overestimate it?
- He's certainly not a panacea - a question of privacy, because he doesn't always want to tell others about his actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in their niches.
For example, for managing devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not over flimsy ones, but over such stingy, short ones.
The gestures were taken, not by camera, but by a hand - held bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
As long as it's large, it can theoretically be reduced to the size of the wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a mixed type of control, like a gesture plus a voice.
- How's that?
- For instance, how do you ask me to give you this gas bank?
You're gonna say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine might or could not at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future, we will have to focus on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to define more accurately the human response.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution deep down, it's very important.
- In terms of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Is there a lack of permission, depth or something?
- In principle, the present generation is something that can be pushed back into our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it's good to get mega-pixels 8 at 1,000 k/s.
But it's not the mega-pixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, which adds work to algorithm designers.
So we need to remember not only the X-axis and the Y-axis resolution, but also the Z-axis.
It's also very important speed, the number of personnel per second.
The human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is frankly low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond Laboratory made a sensor with a controlled processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects human and machine interaction.
I'd really use the equivalent of this device in my work, but it doesn't require any more personnel per second.
- You don't have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "chambers", one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the other is a reflected signal receiver.
The third camera is actually a normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the facility.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or add to it by increasing the amount of calculations required.
It would be nice to create a flexible equivalent of Kinect, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how this will help in the three-dimensional determination of the situation.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that in terms of the everyday use of supplemented reality technologies, points are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time, keeping the smartphone in your raised hands is not very convenient, but I think the coolest option would be "transmitting"-added reality, where, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could switch from eyeglasses to smartphone, projection display and everywhere else.
Points are a very personal device, in which they are powerful (private things only you can see) and, at the same time, weakness - supplemented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work with other people on virtual objects.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: There is no tactical response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group’s answers to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh breakthrough in human and machine interaction.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactical sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a sort of a sub-tend for the image.
She's good at recording the pressure!
But there are technologies that are really designed to give these air-perceived cards -- for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic beams at a certain point where your finger is located -- gives you a feeling, but as long as it's very weak -- it's like you're being blown on pillows.
There are wrist bracelets that affect nerve endings in your fingers -- also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to cheat your brain?
Making him think he feels what he's supposed to feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried it yet.
There is another challenge that needs to be faced for a long time: how to make a person physically in a very limited space believe that he is walking through an open, almost endless, pathways and concepts (not necessarily in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
As long as you cheat your brain, it's been working for a long time.
That's what makes working on a virtual reality so attractive to the researcher -- a lot of things in the very early stages.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbolt.
The Rusbolt is continuing the Petersburg Avantgard project on citizens who are ahead of them in the vanguard of culture and art.
The top list has already been filled with bright figures from the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the city, often recognizing in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbolta" is the empathious artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a man who's been dressed in all the reds that the Russian Museum meets, and the Summer Garden, and the fads and backyards.
Cyril Miller's paintings always collect crowds of spectators wherever they look.
Cyril Miller is one of the only socio-philosophics of Petersburg, the creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller is a bright man of the Petersburg vanguard at the end of the '80s, the beginning of the '90s.
He is also a man of the city who, by his appearance in the streets, smiles at the citizens, raising the spirits of all.
Recently, he took up the hurdy and became a Petersburg hurdy because he was ripe for this complex role with all his god - fearing existence, philosophy, and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking around the city all over red instead of yellow or turquoise, like?
- I chose red as a visual and image modeler.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and a society.
Although everything in society is a little bit gray, it is causing aggression and inflammation.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the Exhibition in Nevsky D.C., where my work was exhibited.
I realized it was my way.
Then there was a wave of old free, informal artists, and new, free-like artists were not clear to me.
I started to be friends with the artists of the new wave, the post-gasonlands, which led to "Pushkinsky-10", and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theatre, clothes, music, all but a word.
- And all of this has come together in your Art Clinic... - I thought it was important to be at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best creative powers must be gathered.
In 1995, I took up the territory in Pashkinska-10, and there was a music and art club, a God-fearing club, a house of a Petersburg Bohemian goddess, while there was no repair.
A lot of people were born there -- the Nomas, Tekila Jaz, I remember Shnoura being brought with the "Echo Van Gogh" project.
Shnoor and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, and they were drawn in a stretch of peace, and among them was the fashionable composer Igor Vovin.
When the group played alive, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programmes until the Khali-Ghali times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went away, and he got basic education and education from us.
The D 137 Gallery, the Gryboeds Club, are feedback from the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and people are gone.
I'm a hero of yesterday's century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, and the prize was "People of Our City."
I was named "The Master of the Year", and my climax ended.
In the new times, it's awkward to work under the old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
It's easy to become popular in our years, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is characterized by recognized manners.
- Many of my paintings are tricks, and they have a very strong sense of urgency and urgency.
I'm gonna have a software exhibition, "Russia's Clown Museum."
Clowns are an out-of-date category.
I used to be social, it's painful and scary to be like this.
But in clowns, it's all swelling. Tragic's done away with.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian change in order of command.
They now find their clothes oriented towards external mechanics, not internal.
Maybe he shouldn't have a hand and you should spit in his face.
And the deception will be lifted by re-dressing.
And recently we saw you as a city charmer.
Who, if not me, they should be.
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be neat, tactful, sweet.
There's a disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people had gone down into packs, and one Goddess was in love, and the other was in love.
Now everyone's broken into micro-socials, it's hard for everyone to like.
I'm not a centenarian for everybody to like.
Now you have to think who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 worshipers.
- And Stasa Mikhaylova's got several thousand!
- He's got drop-and-split, and the sex and social sphere is working.
And on a cultural basis, 300 people will come and 10,000 people won't come, and eventually less management, less money, everything smells.
I've got worshipers, and I don't want to cheat them or ruin what I've earned.
I used to write paintings like this when I was a young man, they're on the wall next to Falk and Larono's hanger.
I started off with paintings that usually end.
Now there's a lot of confusion.
They say culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of culture yesterday, and I grew up with the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, giving up money to paint paintings.
I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's Peterburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this notion: a cultural official.
But not all of them can practice culture.
The kings of the right kings may not have understood much about culture, but they knew that proper experts should be kept.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're inflated, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them the way.
It's a delicious taste right now.
The same Erarta, but they're distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, Moscow has a lot more culture, there's soil.
And on our stones it's hard to grow art.
We need cultural soil, and we now have more writers than readers, which is wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious.
We've got this layer of tone.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with the St. Petersburg grant
Birth in Outer Space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
The caravans of spaceships carrying earthships are on board to search for a spare planet.
To preserve mankind, the key question is, How can we continue our line of descent in a state of weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I think there's not much choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be explored at least hypothetically.
“This is Venus and Mars”, says senior scientist at the P.C. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAIS) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live in high altitudes or in Venus's orbit... in space.
The field of reproduction in space began with the flora.
About half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of orbited peas were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then there's the removal of insects in orbit, tiny fruit flies.
In 1979, eggs of quail were sent into space to check on how the embryo develops under conditions of weightlessness.
We're getting out of a perfectly normal bird.
And then we have a problem.
“The problem that this bird has to find resistance must stand on its legs and begin to move,” explains Ran Vladimir Sichev, director of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP).
Not finding resistance, the chicks squabbled indiscriminately.
After 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks didn't react to the light and the sound.
And the trouble was that they just died four days later.
"And twice we hatched the chicks, then we refused, because it's just impossible to work with them," notes the failure of the experiment with the birds in space, Vladimir Sichev.
With the animals, the biological "minicide" last flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
However, only one sex person will be on Bion's biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats that were being sent into space with fruit.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found there.
"It was just on the biosatellites, but again it's a single experiment, and such research needs to be done," Vladimir Sicev says.
After landing, space rats produced offspring.
But approaching the problem of reproduction in space is not yet possible.
It's not easy.
The animal, losing its natural habitat, simply cannot fulfill its sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, there are no such experiments.
But women in space have been flying for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereskova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is a woman's organism.
Our chaick is gone, and no one on Earth can say if it will continue after it's gone into space.
Can she have a baby after this flight?
"No one answered that question," says the veteran of the Wakhtang Vachnicdze missile industry.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut of Valentine Tereskov gave birth to a daughter.
Andrjan's father, Nicolaus, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitsk, the second female cosmonaut, was born in orbit twice and even in open space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have enough units, we have cosmonauts that after long flights have cost everything, and we have a healthy generation growing.
"And, more importantly, it's dangerous even in orbiting flights," the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
Nevertheless, mankind needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory flight preparation phase.
Here, in a zero-floating environment, the astronauts are learning how to operate in outer space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If there's water for adults, even though it's comfortable, but it's a strange environment, it's a natural element for babies.
Little Eutyanders seem to confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the baby's about nine months in the mother's eyelid fluid, which makes it easier for him to get used to the water.
In principle, it makes sense, because it's only two weeks since the birth of that first bath.
"It's very little to forget," says lector Marin Axenov.
In fact, if weightlessness for a born child is more natural, women need gravity, the power of gravity.
Very quickly, the muscles of the belly, the waist, and the ability to push out the fetus are being scratched in weightlessness.
All right, let go of that, relying on birth stimulants.
Of course, you can go to a special cell and give birth, and she'll push him out.
"And then what?" asks the unrivaled questions of Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without being attracted to the earth, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscle system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special training suit.
He will simply be deprived of what he will need.
"And this experiment that we're going to do by allowing a child to be born in a foreign environment will lead us to bring a person with a completely de-defeated human being to Earth," the head of the IBP Bioethics Committee, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a question of theory.
However, in time this will be a reality when earthmen on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the General Audit and Audit Office: The audit of the barber system failed due to the fault of the politicians.
In the public procurement industry, the Czech Republic had good controls and, despite the existence of quality legislation, was behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for Aktuálná.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, which I think we are missing," commented Cal's current situation.
Such opinions are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter's approach to the so-called scavenger system is cited.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the GDP (Citizen Democratic Party) would not concern entrepreneurs with checks - is this prohibited or permitted?
“The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister may not oppose the work of the institutions responsible for verifying and enforcing obligations,” states Kala.
At an audit committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, which compared the laws on public procurement of both countries.
What exactly was that?
There is a parallel test that we started two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation states how public procurement is to take place, followed by national legislation and then applied in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even with incomplete verification, there have been interesting differences - simplely speaking, we may have legislation that is “accurate and infallible”, but in practice we are putting Germany over some of the parameters.
It follows that it is not sufficient to create more and more refined rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
But how can this project help you what it means to you?
It is this joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions because it does not produce positive results.
Economy means getting the right stuff for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're going to do this by reducing the limitation of orders.
This system may become filled with booms, so that those who want to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the limitation were not reduced.
You are talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CRA (Control and Audit Office) or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, Bundesrechungshof, which is based on our principle, also has a panel working a little differently, but mostly both agencies operate similarly.
In addition, powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit offices and federal lands, their system is slightly different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Chambers of Account.
As far as local legislation is concerned, it's easier than we have?
Actually, I don't want to compare without specific data, but in some ways Germany can be taken as a model, but it can't be certain that it's the best in everything.
Is it because they're better at controlling?
Certainly not, but to repeat, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, what was the impact of the amendment of the Public Procurement Act on your establishment?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet been revealed in our verification work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, some delay must be taken into account.
We're taking this into consideration only in the process of preparing future checks -- we're starting to use our new tool to "detect the risk of insecurities," through which we've driven almost 14,000 government contracts, and we've analysed them -- and there will certainly be these changes, because the constraints are changing, the conditions of some types of tenders are changing, and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law will bring benefits or additional burdens on the system of bureaucraticism?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be “hardened” and cannot be followed.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to a supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - a regional council) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in such a way?
I think it's not that way.
The system should exclude those who want to seize and abuse but not punish those who commit a formal error that does not affect the solution.
Such a system would only put even greater pressure on bureaucratics.
And then how do you get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this road will not lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister said recently that the GDP would not bother entrepreneurs with the checks of the so-called barber system.
Is the Black System prohibited or permitted?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister could not oppose the work of the bodies charged with verifying and enforcing obligations.
You can say, "We're gonna change this law and let it go," but you can't say we're gonna pretend like nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains quite strict rules, as and what should be formally implemented, which will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the best-proposed candidate is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly passing.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly going through, but they're kind of more cautious.

This morning, roads were passing in the Carlovarian border, but some frozen and snowy.
The temperature fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but must be slightly warm during the day.
The snowfall in the region has ceased, only in the lowlands is there a small layer.
However, about an inch [30 cm] of snow lies on the ridges of the Red Mountains.
Information from regional road workers revealed that the visibility of the places was lower due to fog.
The R6 highway and the first-class roads in the region are now being passed without restrictions.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
All roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain tracks, are also covered.
But on some of their plots still lie the remains of frozen snow and the places of snow driven by it.
Especially do we need to pay attention to high - altitude roads.
Paradoubsky and Kralovegradsky
The Czech Road and Motorway Administration reports on its Internet pages that some of the roads in eastern Czechia are threatened by a cold, while mountain roads and highland roads may be covered by snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers of the cold, which can be formed especially on the highlands of the Pardoubian region.
It can be near Lanshkroun, Usti nad Orlica, Policia, Switavi or Visok-Mito, especially on second and third-grade roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34, located in Svitavi, are treated with chemicals.
Especially the snow lies on the roads of the Krkonosche and the Eagle Mountains.
The snow layer is located on roads on high ground in the areas of Rikhnova nad Knezhnou and Trutnova.
In East Czechia today, variable clouds are free of rainfall.
Temperatures usually vary from minus three to one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Plzen Land
The roads in the Plzen region are passing this morning, but places need to be careful and adaptable.
It's freezing in the morning, temperatures range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, some places may be slippery.
Drivers may encounter fog in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
The D5 route is now nearly unlimited, but road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
The southern regions of Plzni and Tahov may be frozen.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet and there is also a warning about the possibility of slippery sections.
Drivers should be careful, especially on low-use roads in the Shumawa area.
The Land of the Olomautsk
Drivers heading to the highlands of the Olomowsky region should take into account the snowmeasure on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenhogor sledge and on the road towards the Videl Krisha.
In the night, snow forced road workers to enter the streets, according to information from road authorities, fell about three inches [3 cm] of snow in Shumperka.
In other areas, roads tend to pass without restrictions.
"On the high places of the Schumperk lies the remains of the snow.
Drivers heading towards Esenik should bear in mind the presence of snow-sniff in the Chervenhogorian sedlass,” said the CHAN (Czech Agency for the News) today.
During the night, their colleagues from Esenik also went to clear the roads and assured them that the roads on the highlands had remained naked and wet after handling chemicals.
There are no restrictions on roads in Olomouc, but in Sternberg drivers must be careful at forest areas where humidity is still present.
Mustard Land, Lieberec Land
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are a few difficult places to go.
According to information from the police database, apart from a number of locations with ice or snow falling out, a mountain road has been closed from Telica at the Clinic in the town of Ustitzk province.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so that snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the south-east of the Czech Midlands, on the contrary, there are no problems; the roads are mostly dry.
Traffic complications are not yet reported.
Road workers report the emergence of a cold in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for his creation at night - it was raining all day, it was snowing, the sky was clear at night and freezing began.
Adverse conditions are reported on the main highway and on the I/13 road at the borders of the Libertian and Libertian borders.
The snow-torn branches of the trees relating to the road itself were forced to close the road in the Telica on Kninica.
At concerts, we want to build positive energy.
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the many disturbing news stories that we as humans are so easily exposed to.
Together with the Tap Tap group, we are constantly joking about this subject and saying that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you're going to give an absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you tell your readers more about this?
This is a nationwide fund-raising exercise that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing capacity of the Maya calendar, which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20th, at 9:00, three concerts will be held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, when the May calendar ends on Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was my idea, and then we all came up with this together with our artist, Gonza Augusta.
In addition to having sufficient positive energy to prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state of this world that we will one day hand over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world, which can be purchased on www.e-tap.cz, and thus support.
The Tap Tap group, together with other musicians, also completed the end-of-world anthem called the End of the Light.
Will this Beneficial concert be played by a favorite YouTube audience?
Of course, at the very end, if it's going to work out and the world doesn't end.
He's going to be served by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
At the same time, the smoke will also be broadcast live on Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played by Jesus in Tomasz Hanak's music video, and also Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other members of Czech cultural life, as we have many charitable events and concerts.
We're trying to actively involve them in these projects.
Turns out a lot of people like to work with us, they're curious.
What's the end of the world coming from the concert?
For the purchase of equipment for the STUDEO non-barrence educational centre, we've been working with a civil association called Tap at the Edlička Institute for the sixth year.
Teachers regularly visit students in Edlička Institute schools and have fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the project for the additional construction of the Edlička Institute, there will be a separate building to which we will move with the project.
Each concert will be attended by several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to develop a programme that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, there will be Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barth, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “grandsome events” in the future?
In May, we're going to be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring festival and, of course, we're going to have an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we'd be happy to have a presentation at the Czech National House in New York, and I would like to speak in Washington and Chicago, if we are in the United States.
With regard to the foreign side, you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks.
We've got five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus everything with a lot of cargo and tools boxes.
However, as long as we were able to cope with it, the Czech Airways and British Airways airlines have always been excellently prepared, and I've been amazed at how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything has gone well.
Through overseas visits, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes toward persons with disabilities, and so forth.
What have you faced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, we have seen in Russia that the East is still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague, Moscow has many barriers, and it is still a wildebeest to move a human being on an electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.
There are also such banal things as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, should we constantly catch up with advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to make it clear that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own in the streets, go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It's not very common there is that a lot of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, and that's why we're a little ahead of The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public is one thing, but at a time when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, everything will really start to change.
For now, these are isolated cases -- people with strong will.
The Tap Tap is now very popular, but will come back two years ago, that in 1998 you were forced to organize it?
I went to Edlička Institute as a tutor, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician and I play a saxophone, I have an interesting music circle with my colleague.
Well, over time, as our lead, Lady Angelovich, says, it's a little out of control. (Laughter)
Popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confused?
It is true that we were helped to join famous singers and to work actively on the propaganda of the group.
We have concluded that the work that no one can appreciate is essentially as if there is no work.
With the assistance of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Have you ever had the goal of spreading The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their capacity to do something unusual.
Show business is full of things that imitate each other.
It makes sense that everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of the man who sees us is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But this pity is totally superfluous, because people with disabilities are not suffering and all the abandoned personalities that we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Have you been successful in being a firm leader, as many people consider you?
If we want to do quality work, we must be in many things without compromise and be disciplined.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with romantic performances and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
At present, there are 20 members of the Tap Tap Group.
How many were there in early 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will be held one day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, 20.12.202 at 2 p.m.
The concert will be held in Prague at Incheba Stadium, Brno, at Fléda Club and Ostrava, in the Plynojem Centre, with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by television at the time of the song of The Tap Tap "The End of the Light".
The aim of this project is to raise funding of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional, barretic equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Yedlička Institute in Prague.
A concert ticket costs 400 kroner for children under 12 years of age free of charge, and tickets can be purchased in advance in Bohemiaticet.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after Czechia, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated actively in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But Poland’s path to space had begun a long time earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts had made space flights, but this was not always understood.
I recall, for example, A. Sterfeld's lecture, which, on 6 December 1933, represented an idea to the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory from his innovative work "Introduction in Space".
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadowski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltri Award and André Luis Hirsch in France for "Introduction to Space."
Dr. Jan Gadowski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Hadomsky became a prominent world promoter of cosmonautics, and his contribution was appreciated, including the fact that one of the craters on the other side of the Moon had been named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway cutter equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea was not known, nor were the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket had to be used for the crash or for the braking of the trolley.
The only information on this is known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has begun to think about missiles.
The study was carried out by the Weapons Technology Section in cooperation with Professors Mechisław Wolfke and Gustav Mokzitzki.
The remaining materials show that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, a specialized press introduced the idea of a photovoltaic fighter rocket proposed by an engineer of Rogozinski, and next year the work of the “Levia-Kivolotsk Air Missile and Air Bomb” was launched.
Both projects were developed for the military use of missile engines.
Before the war itself, the Interim Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczasaw Komitet Doradczo-Naukouy) was responsible for all military missile projects, which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended because of the outbreak of the war.
The next scientific work on space appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the Polish Society of Astronautycine (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautycone).
For the first time, social issues are referred to in the November 1954 issue of the magazine “Problems”, which contains four voluminous articles on astronauts.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotović proposed to organize a community that would be involved in space.
By that time, artificial satellite projects had been gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since early 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) has tried to join the international Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and has already become an effective member of the Astronautics Society of Poland (PAA).
The following year, Kaziz Zarankevich, First President of the PAA (02-1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautics Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PAA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful RM Meteorological Missile, which was the first Polish rocket to carry out a scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of reaching 1,800 metres, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
An improved RM-1A version was subsequently built and two-stage RM-2 missile tests were carried out in the Blades Desert in the summer of 1959.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to carry out real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could have been over 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high-velocity wind.
In 1962, however, further development was suspended.
The first RM-type missile was inherited by the Meteorological 1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed to be two-step, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteorological-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed which were different in size for scientific equipment.
The Meteorological-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 litres, the Meteorological 1B had a volume of 0.34 litres, and the Meteorological 1C had a volume of 0.62L.
The maximum flight range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteorological 2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute and its first flight testing began in October 1970.
The Meteorological 2 rocket, with a start weight of 380 kg, was capable of delivering a useful load of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then version 2N and meteor-3 were built.
Reference should also be made to Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Space Research Committee) in 1960 and to the establishment of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The decree triggered a lively debate in society.
It would no doubt be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberalized economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is related to the principle of free trade and to the free, unbounded movement of private capital, together with unsavory financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of the labour force (wages) priced.
This concept needs to be understood to mean that the manufacturer, through the delivery of cheap goods, is trying to resist economic competition by “stretching” the cost of a competitor in order to take up most of the market and thus increase his own income.
On a massive scale, this means either the transfer of production abroad or the foreign-cost procurement or the disappearance; as a result, unemployment increases in countries where labour costs are high compared to those of others.
As private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for unemployment, the State ' s inevitable social spending is increasing.
In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of the business lord to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social economic and social damage they have suffered in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
Unprecedented private capital practices create situations at the economy level of individual States where national Governments are forced to compete with one another in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments are giving their own population arbitrariness to private capital despite social declines.
This is reflected above all in the changes to existing legislation.
The aim is to force their people economically to comply with private capital dictates, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and, at the same time, serves as a tool for reducing the rights of workers in labour legislation.
As a result, poverty levels are increasing, but the difference between the poor and the rich is growing.
For several years there has been a public distribution of food to the poor who are unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
As part of the improvement of the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constant cases where employed persons receive such wages that the State must pay them to obtain a subsistence minimum.
The same scandal has become known to the public in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all EU southern States undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people under pressure from a catastrophic decline in social status are either forced to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on low wages on the backs of society, in the hope that private investment will one day come into the country.
However, he wondered where he would come from.
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all because Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptian, African is still working for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim, to the point of weariness, that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that the controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists that the State should not interfere in the economy.
The next question should be asked whether private capital, now virtually the policy manager and the whole State, was acting for its own selfish purposes?
The obvious answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of almost all-powerful and omnipresent lobbyes in all States.
As a result, we have a desperate situation that is manifested in corruption, in mutual benefit, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment but is not a crime.
In the FIWG, the situation is that government ministries, owing to their lack of financial resources, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal firms, which are closely linked to industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
The whole power does not come from the people, as stated in the Western Constitution, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberalized democracy is now rapidly emerging in a situation like that described by Appian in “The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompeii”: “The State has long been breaking up and the agencies are engaged in violence.
The hoisting, illegal receipt of grace by means of stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to elections with a pre-sold vote"......and people were not running for the position of ruler at all, and one day the State was left with a consul for eight months... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As is the case in ancient times, today ' s society is dominated by its own reckless interests, without taking public interest into account.
Private capital is no longer intended for public purposes.
The present outcome is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to make reforms of a deeper nature.
So the reason for the emergence of the fascist and communist regimes must be found in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the present elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are now witnessing, along with the crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution or at least not permanent.
Under pressure from competition at both the international and the national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen public participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the public interest.
Israel: Lab for chaos.
"There will be nothing out of violence and can never come out" -- Sting, a song called "The Big" -- where the main poem of the refress is, "Don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't be there" -- the dying Gutel Schneper, the wife of Meer Amshel Rotschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has generated many reactions.
Some argue in favour of Israel ' s position that it has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians in support of this racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on who, in these recurrent waves of killings, is a criminal and who, in the end, the victims of today's Israeli citizens, including self-governing territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation and were not witnesses to the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the curtain, to see who has been first served by the 95-year-old tension (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small portion of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my discussions are backed by historical facts, some of them based on my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of modern history.
The history of humankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every age we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
Which is not so clear whether these people have always taken completely their own steps, or whether they have been throned by someone who has guided their actions to the stated goals.
It should be admitted that we live at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons and that this concentration of money and its resulting power could not have occurred within one generation.
Among astronomically wealthy families, there's one that can be considered the head of a spore (I don't know if someone's above them, but that's not excluded) - Rothschilds.
There's not much written about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) was purchased in the 1990s to stop rumours linking their names to criminal acts in the higher spheres in which they were located and which have always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
They have large packages of shares in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries whose central banks do not have their shares, they are waging or preparing a war (there were only 7 countries before the invasion of Afghanistan, five countries after the invasion of Iraq, only four after the overthrow of Kaddhafi, but at the same time the Russian Government took over its central bank).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of a central bank for Rotschild Bank of America, was killed in 1865 in the theater during the civil war, and began publishing his own (understood) money.
John F. Kennedy started releasing his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963, and Deputate Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for having launched the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for the three world wars created by Albert Pike, the great masson of the 33rd level.
The first war was to destroy monarchic States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially the Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 to 1 billion (that number of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury and would not consume much of their resources), the establishment of a unified universal religion (ecumenism could not be anything but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method used by a group of the richest families, led by Rotschild, is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab Chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the basis of the FED, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unleash World War I by killing the Hubsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia by beginning the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with a sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (no longer necessary for the destruction of royal Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary, was disbanded.
To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians had created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany than had led to the radicalization of the depleted masses, then only to throw the Germans into a position of sufficient strength, inciting the guilty and offering simple solutions by the Chief, to further establish a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed to act as a fifth column in fuelling the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschild provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War had broken out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had broken out of the chains originally held by bankers or what he had done had been planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps had created the conditions for recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like Germany was provoked by military reparations to the Second World War, the State of Israel was declared to create a hotbed of war for the third.
If international bankers can untie it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will be the victims of the fighting on the front line, now along with the Arab or, to put it more simply, the Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only within the country, but also at the international level (taking only the sharp division of people into Israeli supporters and opponents).
Who is to blame and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment causes resentment in an endless chain of violence if it all begins with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
There is a need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers have encouraged people to vote in elections solely for their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Jaban Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker, doing his utmost to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), will threaten to develop into a world conflict and, given Iran's control over the Ormuz Strait, which contains 20 per cent of the world's oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order”.
The new world order in their presentation is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a large financial aristocracy that is comfortable.
A world where every born organism is implanted at birth into a chip, with which it becomes an entity under total control.
“And compels all small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
That is the wisdom. Everyone who has knowledge can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
"Operation "Argo: When worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979 a crowd of Islamic student demonstrators captured the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for Mohammed Reza Pehlev, who had fled after the U.S. revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the positive outcome was not supposed to be -- she couldn't afford to throw overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
However, it was unable to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by a failed attempt to release hostages by force.
The prisoners were finally released after 444 days of negotiations facilitated by the Government of Algeria.
Their fate has generated a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which resulted in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film by actor Ben Afflek, "Operation Argo", describes one of the episodes of the story that little wins America.
Shortly before the Embassy ' s occupation, six employees had managed to escape.
After difficult peripetes, they finished their journey to the residence of the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, has been able to remove them from Iran, with the help of an extraordinary cover story, according to which they travelled through Canadian passports as members of a survey team looking for sites in the country to take pictures of the science and science epidemic.
Grouping of genres
The plan developed by Tony Mendez's evacuation expert required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend credible, specialized magazines wrote about the draft film, organized a press conference, and a fabricated manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
Affleka's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political triller, so-called film-kinoopus, a story of a successful idea, the connoisseur, is an example of a series of films about friends of Ocean.
The film is constantly changing the moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the captions show landmark historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no major differences).
On the other hand, simplified Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there's scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -- male costumes discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on agency ladders, on the phone...
Ben Affleek was able to make a great career start.
The derisive actor became a respected director, and his game ceased to be the object of ridicule.
“Operation “Argo” his third full-fledged film, following the dark detective “Good-bye, baby, good-bye” (2007) and Triller “City” (2010).
At the same time, this is Affleka's first film, which doesn't appear in his home city, the director of Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place is related to the qualities that have exalted earlier film directors over the Hollywood standard.
And Afflek shows it in "Argo," where Tehran is "playing" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, and when real events are renovated, the entrance scenes of the Embassy fall are impressive, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when history suddenly changes somewhere.
The same effect is achieved by Afflec and his colleagues in fabricated scenes (false headquarters at the Tehran market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative did not imply many exciting scenes of filmmaking importance.
He's working quite well with this little bit, and sometimes he's thinking about something -- it's not that elegant -- where the phone call in America is preventing an impending crisis at Tehran airport, and the runway chase is quite mind-blown.
Argo's disadvantage is the dispersal of the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, as Hollywood colleagues, are truly fascinating, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleka's film lacks a little dramatism, which is a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the production and retro-style that re-establishs the three-years-olds.
But it's hard.
But it's enough to remind you of one, still in the known sense of living history and to show how exaggerated the notions of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services are.
Air balloon inflatation regulations, bananas and circuses
The portal www.bankovnioplatty.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to declare a competition for “the most absurd regulation or project from the EU workshop”.
“We have moved towards this latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies”, stated “the Law” of Patrick Nager.
The recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance contributions for men and women is among those that have already been nominated as absurdity.
So far, women have been given life insurance benefits because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place before the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which is harmful to nature, and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury detectors simply because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substances, or a directive on cell size for chickens, which has resulted in significant travel of eggs this year.
Also criticized was the actual prohibition on the use of the term sandwich oil or the removal of classical light bulbs from sale.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure from a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or group of States (the Czech Republic is thus now even at risk of the veto defending the demands of its banks).
The lobby interests were: for example, bananas of high quality in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and were not able to display “anomalic curvature”.
In so doing, the European Commission was justified in simply harmonizing the existing fragmented national regulations that had complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, mitigated the standards for fruit and vegetables, noting that existing directives would result in a waste of products.
A successful candidate for the interview can also be an EU regulation last year, according to which air balloons that sell must necessarily be provided with a warning that children under eight years of age cannot inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to American studies according to which balloons at play are a potential cause of death for children through suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are prohibited from blowing into fair barrels.
Fun ideas are born at home too.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is absurd: anyone who holds an official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name Macedonia instead of “BURM” (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatsky.com portal, in cooperation with the United liberal economists of the principle of non-interference (Laissez Faire), proposed for a vote, in addition to several of the above-mentioned absurd rules, e.g. the EU Regulation on Food Reserves in the Territory of a Member State.
The EU has established a maximum level of food stocks that may be in the Czech Republic on the date of its accession to the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded its established levels of canned mushrooms, for which it was subject to a large fine.
The interviewers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea and the idea of grant grants.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not Brussels.
"We are disadvantaged because we have no sea.
We'll ask the European Union for compensation," stated the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palace (SPC) in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that there was a high crop of grain in the country and that, as a result of so-called interventional procurement, the State had a full stock warehouse to be removed.
The EU, according to Palau, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros for the Czech Republic's far from the ports.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic and organized a tender for grain from landlocked countries.
Grants for the grant were offered to villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, which was headed by Minister Paul Germanz (US-DEU), in particular by the preparation of a grant application from Brussels.
EU: Acquiescence orders are an exception
While decisions in Member States are easily criticized, EU efforts to regulate as well as to improve the functioning and development of the European Union are, in the view of many experts, more deserving of recognition.
A major problem, in the view of the experts, was the receipt of EU grants for projects that did not even have a hint of something similar to the deepening of European integration, but which member States had achieved in discussing the budget.
There is emotion among Czechs and the fact that, as in other European Union countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, retained the name “Olomautsk cheeses”, but the “Tuzema rum”, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, our producers were to be renamed “Touzemak”.
The rum may only be referred to as tarpaulin dystile products, not sugar beet.
The official list of registered EU products, together with the world-renowned cheeses “feta” and “gorgondsol”, marcipan from Germany’s Lubeka or Parma ham, has already been found, for example, carlovaric sacs, a burner and Trichebone carp and a gel.
The EU trademark may also be proud of the Paris hide-and-seek and the canals.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm a lover, ” Ocampura claims.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to mind to run for president?
I'm not thinking about becoming a senator or a president myself.
If there was no problem in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch as the country goes on and on, over the past 20 years, as thieves get mad, people get better taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a solution.
And since I am 40 years old and am an independent person who is not a member of any party, I have no opportunity to influence things other than to run for senator or president.
You went to the Senate, but you went to the presidential castle soon.
Are you turning your back on the people who chose you?
I always said I'd be involved in the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I explained later that if I were chosen by the senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a post; a post is a tool by which I can carry out my views.
I therefore need the greatest influence and the greatest authority.
But the challenge isn't just that we're like a nation racing in our own bar or on TV, but we're ready to trample on anyone who's trying to change something.
The media add to this by blaspheming and confusing freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was bribing journalists or that I was an adviser to Irgi Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
The battle for the presidential castle has begun with theories on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and reverse property declarations worth more than 20 million.
To do so, the law must be changed.
You do not have such powers as President, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to meet this challenge?
When I lobbied as a citizen to make guided tours a free business, it was possible to make progress.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, they are deliberately obstructed, which deters citizens.
As an independent, non-party person, I have a much greater potential for receiving support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without party-to-party planning, without looking at dogmas, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be more involved with the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think I'm being considered to the left.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we go forward.
It's not that someone's right, it's someone's left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for the community whether it will be offered by the HR Committee or the GDP, and I will also be opposed to a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're populist.
But don't you prove it by what you say?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
It may be called populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already in operation in the world, or are spoken of by eminent experts.
But if you don't support Parliament, you'll only have slogans.
You won't be able to keep up with this.
Or do you think that when you go out and talk to people, you can realize criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other option.
Just to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side so that we can achieve ours.
Had I been elected President, it would not have been a problem to organize a live television broadcast calling on the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they will, if they refuse, have to tell them why they don't want to.
If there was a strong personality that would be abused, there could be pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was public pressure.
I'm saying I'm a lover, not a genius, and I'm not an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and beliefs.
I'm just beginning in politics, and I'm going to try and get the majority support for my programme.
I am trying to move myself; if this fails, I will end in six years and return to the private sector.
It sounds in part like Okamura's supposed to save Czechia.
I'm not a lifesaver.
I know I'm not going to do anything alone, so I've gone through a number of famous people offering to run for the Senate.
I went to the Janchure Radium, and he refused because of his heavy workload.
I also supported at least the leading investigation of journalist Jan Laurentsov, who exposed the fraud with light oil products.
I've put my name on it because people are really unhappy, but I feel like I'm on weight right now.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, and most of the people who went to the election did.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
The people chose the Senate so that the changes would be difficult to make.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, such as the direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the cause of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to test every potential supporter's past, and I don't have money for it.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and what about your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a site in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, a collection of works of art of about 10 million, Aston Martin of 3.5 million and Scad Superb of a million, and a few million more in the account.
By the way, I had Aston Martin because it was my little dream -- I'd always liked James Bond, who was driving a car, Galantheus with women, and at the same time fighting falsehood and lawlessness.
You drive to Aston Martin, own 60 million worth of property and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I do not have sponsors indicates that my programme is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign from my pocket.
The cost of the campaign will essentially cover my senatorial salary.
But I wouldn't live on that money, for example, if I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I wanted to earn money, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
So you're going to do business to make it possible for you to live?
Didn't you say you'd cut down on this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the salary.
As I have promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the manager of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be an unremunerated man who will keep the Republic.
But I have to live for something, too.
How much business are you used to getting per month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get and beyond.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You will find a full interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Right.
Architects MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not only imaginary - for example, Speykenisse and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photographs
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, and at last we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, who's walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a large business nearby, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I'm asking myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has an Internet, an iPad, and e-books.
Nobody goes to such old-fashioned libraries now, right?
Spikenisse, a small sleeping town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this unfortunate situation, it was decided several years ago to contribute to general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted in the euro notes, in the form of painted miniaturs from the ferrobetone.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the city's fathers realized that they had the only chance to defeat the statistics: build a library here!
Vini Maas, of the MVRDV rotterdam architectural office, artisan of bold columns and author of acute, sometimes cynical, constructions, took his usual insatiableness into consideration and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003, with five books under the mouse and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked in amazement and shook their shoulders, the impudent Maas drew from his original gift a pyramid in size and concluded his defense of his project by saying, "Dear citizens!"
Here's my proposal: "The Book Mountain" in Speikenis, so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of a rehabilitation project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, mail and a number of residential buildings adjacent to them and a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the 2012 Dutch Best Library.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Timber Competition.
Thus, the faceless suburbs, which previously could offer nothing but a post-technical pedestrian zone and an amazingly poor town, whose white facades suggest a milk factory, became richer than one modern architecture.
But most importantly, the first public building in the history of this town has come into existence in Speykenisse.
A Long Way to the Book
First impression is Eldorado's bookbook under the cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the center of the mountain, because true worshipers of architecture and reading would prefer to explore this area by foot.
The glassy room on all sides is bright and easily apparent, the floors of a burnt brick and the elegant street lights are infallibly creating a sense of public urban space.
The urban environment has been restored perfectly.
The look is involuntarily looking for benches, dogs, and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere there are books, books, books.
"The bookshelves are usually located along the facades and there is a large dark hall inside, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Vini Maas.
We put the classical configuration of space on our heads and pulled out the reading area outside.
The internal space of the bookmount is skillfully used, with offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental centre and technical facilities located in the center.
The black bookshelves are particularly fond of being used as a separation of walls, parapets, and ladders.
Their appearance, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and construction engineers are lost in guesses about what this unknown material is.
“We have sought to work with secondary materials,” explains Jop Trauborst, project manager representing the Speykenisse community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And on one occasion at an agricultural enterprise in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fibrous material with a millimetre thickness has been used as a base.
It's cheap and it saves time.
The thin textile serves one or two seasons and can then be thrown out.
For the library, this painting -- for the first time in this volume -- was compressed into a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) is transformed into a dark, homogeneous, solid material that smells a little like a new car and a little sneaker.
There are 105 steps to the summit.
A person who travels nearly 500 meters [500 m] in length will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only by a fantastic view of the city but also by Dutch rafters and tree ficus in pots.
They care for the atmosphere, especially the right humidity on the literary mountain.
Cost per new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," says Troubest.
The heat of the earth is used for heating and cooling.
Even though the Book Mountain stands under a glasscap, even on clear days, the sun falls into the air for only a short time.
Large wooden glued farms, placed perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and receive most of the sun’s rays.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roll curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned earlier in IT, has already visited the new library.
Liesette Verhaig was here too.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bozard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Speykenisse, who has been missing for a long time."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to offer a book from his own congregation.
The books were supposed to occupy empty spaces on the shelves of an understaffed library - at the time, there were 7,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are on top.
"There's nothing worse than a semi-arid library," says architect Vini Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every citizen now has some connection to this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for jewelry.
So MVRDV was able to solve a royal challenge called identity creation in a professional jargon.
Speykenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for identity building.
Sabo: "The Germans have a more important role to play"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, US - European relations expert, Berlin balances on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position does not support it either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
At the time of the Libyan rebellion in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the imposition of a no-flight zone.
As a result, NATO carried out this proposal.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The point is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, from a policy that the US so to speak, to a German foreign policy itself.
The fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy makes the situation more difficult.
So the Germans are back between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just trying to find their role, but they're on the way to a more “normal” foreign policy.
This is the foreign policy that France or Great Britain pursues.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a position that is independent of the position of the US or European partners in its national interest.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. exports and links with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are very different from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore defend its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It therefore needs to be careful not to offend the public and elites in Arab countries.
In any case, it has a role to play.
But I would not attach too much importance to this, it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German calculations.
Has Germany damaged its relationship with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that understanding of the German position prevails in Europe and even in the United States.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This is a signal that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that it should be considered in its interest.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, the veto was expressly advocated.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has sufficient understanding of the European position.
But because of the local political situation, the Government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as significant as ever.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not pleased with Netanyahu's policy at all.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the U.S. on the one hand and the situation of a critical EU partner on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a unified, uncontroversial European policy, but that is not the case today.
Therefore, they cannot act as part of a broader approach and are forced to act instead only on the basis of their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position in the future.
Clearly, it is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
The subject has always been sensitive.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not assume a truly primary role?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany has not been accustomed to this; it is still always in trouble and, for obvious reasons, has always had a significant role to play.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis -- every time Germany takes on an important role, a wide range of anti-German feelings are shown.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
In fact, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and opinions, which is not easy.
So U.S. influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who's left?
The Germans would have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's unpleasant, or it's exacerbating a lack of love for you, it's life!

“Protection of trademarks” in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned trademark, and Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a completely official name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from which it is established.
However, it would be protected until the owners of the initial names brought legal action.
Yet, it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“Foreigns are increasingly finding it difficult to defend their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Patloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wesing, specializing in trademark infringements in the Far East.
My desk shows up every week on a new case of this kind.
It is sufficient for the simulators to add just a few letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So Gucci makes Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
German enterprises, such as Puma, are legally copied in the same way.
Patlach opens a folder with records from the trademark registration office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered there the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name also used for the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese are known to be world champions for copying and violating intellectual property rights.
In large cities, there are multi-storey supermarkets that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However, the Patloch cases are not the same, and on instructions from his trustees, he is opposed to the fact that Chinese enterprises are given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "bunk of minpies", a stamp passenger.
The word is associated with "ban Dakuan".
That's what we call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not admit guilt
"It harms business, it's something to be fought against," Pattloch says.
"The brand is washed, the unique situation is lost, the image suffers very much."
The financial loss and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, with a sales volume of Euro15 billion per year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to obtain the removal of doubtful records on the trademark registry, and it is expensive to do so.
The process may last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Patloch describes cases in which the court dismissed claims because after a long time the contested name became “market reality”.
If the complainant is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarizer because he damaged his trademark in China, says Patloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with Sany, a construction machine manufacturer who had recently purchased a Putzmeister concrete company.
So the Chinese still have the right to use a symbol similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo company Geley originally used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, and he had to change it.
Lacoste's fashion producer lost in China to the simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had the famous crocodile looking in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO Trademark Registration Office in Beijing confirms that difficulties were encountered in 2010 owing to the shortage of staff and equipment in the premises.
But last year, there was a “return from an emergency in the working process to a normal”.
Thus, the number of pending objections cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending before the agency.
It's expensive to fight it.
As is so often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received over 1.4 million applications to protect trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China, for the tenth consecutive time, has led a list of new registrations worldwide, reporting to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan of fees were paid.
If you simplify it, it means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 Yuan or 160 euros.
Her challenge is worth much more than that, as the case of Fredenberg, a German family business.
For more than seven years, the firm has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans were able to achieve that their illicit manufacture of forged car parts had been eliminated.
However, the simulator has established Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was an omission, since the names in Germany are unprotected, says Hanno Venttzler, chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities Board in Munich.
And the CTMO Trademark Registry rejected Munich's claim.
True, in both of the following contexts, Fredenberg won, but the opposing side continues to fight.
You gotta be careful.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentsler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive, and it takes us a lot of time, money and nerve."
In-house costs are unlikely to be accounted for, and the firm's archive has had to look at even acts of centuries ago to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "greater six-digit sum in euros" for settlement.
"It's clear how expensive it is for us," says Wentsler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to move to Europe.
That is, if the simulators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The concert had long since ceased production in these areas, but had been able to prevent registration.
"We need to be careful," says Wentsler.
Both he and counsel, Pattloch, recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
It was not sufficient to rely on international trademark protection provisions, but foreigners “should in any way be protected, registered also in China”, said Wentsler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses the last act of his trademark drama, then he must pay the other side licence fees for his own name, explains Wentsler.
Otherwise we're being pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Burning, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi's chorus is rehearsing, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The history of relations over 8,733 kilometres.
First, the cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats, and men's carcasses pick up the beats on the floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
It is only then that the voices of the singers - alth, bass, tenor, and soprano - slowly increase — that they come in, charm and follow each other.
And Fita Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his mother's shoes with flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychological Sciences in Heidelberg, the Khor Imbongi rehearsing a new song.
Fifty people from 23 to 69 years of age, a specialist in human genetics, came to the rehearsal.
Om “Obani” is a difficult thing, every voice of the chorus has its own text, and in a totally foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
According to the Unaids assessment, the United Nations AIDS programme estimates that there are about 34 million people living with HIV throughout the world.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Estitgeni, Voices for Africa has found chiefs in Germany.
Of these, 70 are attending a school preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take care of your boss.
It guarantees the child school money, uniforms and a daily hot lunch in Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means a storyteller or a praiser.
There's no talk in this room, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, a chorus learns songs in this foreign, soft language, and occasionally even brings them back to the place where they first appeared — southern Africa.
After all, the village of Esitgeni, which depends on the voices of the German chorus, is located at a distance of 8,733 kilometres away from Heidelberg, north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland.
Infected 40 per cent
About 2,000 people live there, some still living in simple mud and straw huts, many of which are children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the HR virus.
In Estitgen, the small-scale health of Swaziland is reflected: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF data.
Circumcision of the extreme flesh among men, which has proved to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost non-existent among the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland ' s population have an immunodeficiency virus, and death in the middle of a quarter is not rare.
Khor opened up this village on a joint visit to Africa in the spring of 2005, but earlier the Imgodnis saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but simply all — food, clothing, education.
Without schooling a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment by the individual participants to send the child to school for several euros a year and to allow him to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, a chorus founded Voices for Africa, which has since taken almost professional care of AIDS orphans in Estitgen.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs are classified as syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (glorium).
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are common viruses.
Lobster pediculosis and scabies are parasitic STDs.
What are the main groups affected?
Cyphilis and gonorrhea are found mostly among men who have sex with men.
Robert Koha ' s Institute believes that in at least four out of every five cases of Syphilis registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of men ' s sexual relations.
Heterosexual adults frequently experience sexually transmitted diseases, including chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candiz (grabic), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections are from this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are more common than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also have a frequent human papilloma virus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
Syphilis disease, according to Robert Coha Institute, has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than the previous year.
What are some symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases?
In case of infectious diseases, there may be symptoms in the field of genitals, complaints of urethra, discharge, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, and bubbles or sealing.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Conservatives can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
In fact, partially sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend a regular survey, particularly in the case of frequent sexual changes.
In the case of early diagnosis, most STDs can be cured and remote effects avoided.
Chefs, donations and not least honorarium performances all over Germany allow for something to be collected.
"We've all sent about 200,000 euros to Estitgen," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is managed by Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also makes sure that orphans are well organized, such as one of her grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call it on the Zulu old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them took up to 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and arranged for children to appear on time every day in class.
Those who have no family come to Hanishil's shelter, a single woman receiving a salary from an association, as well as two cooks who prepare each day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chickens, and organized HIV testing with the American Health Organization PSI for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease, which is so evident throughout the country, is preferred to be deeply silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's connected to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of surpluses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-authorized life style is also responsible for the rapid spread of the HF virus in recent years.
But it also rests on wandering workers who are spreading the virus throughout the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're barely used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
To support cultural exchange a little, the Ibmagoni chorus travels to southern Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, a spirit of war, confidence and black self-awareness, which many in the south of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in black - this recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but it even happens to have tears in front of harsh border guards.
The trip is always carried to Estitjani, where singers visit children in high school.
Although it is difficult to find a small village on the map, it is more than known in the Etsulvini Valley.
"Go to Estitgen, there's light," people here say.
And after an 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the drowning singers return to the rehearsal hall at Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also on fire here.
NASA is opening ice in Mercury.
Messinger found evidence that there was ice on Mercury's planet.
The ice cover may be up to 30 feet [20 m] thick.
NASA's space agency has proved that there is ice on Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by the three studies published on Thursday in a special journal Science.
Messinger found evidence that the world's permanently shadowed region was covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 20 inches [30 cm], possibly up to 20 meters [20 m].
Likely, water comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that have encountered Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader of the probe Sean Solomon.
Mercury can have temperatures of up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life came to other places in the solar system.
The probes, telescopes and small robots, such as the Phoenix, are not visible to earth's inhabitants. They are exploring the deepness of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth — small eyes to endless sights.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who looks around the Sun for Neptune, Cerer, by a new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, it is not a “planet”.
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents the “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest blue stars, it is more difficult to identify pink “new-born” stars in the star circle.
This region of star formation - scientists are ineligibly calling it W5 - is opened by the Spitzer telescope at the constellation Cassipei, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.

One of the largest and most clear images of the Hubble telescope: the Vodowt galaxy
Depending on the color of the images of spiral galaxies, they are transformed into actual works of art.
A photograph published by the European South Observatory shows a few thousand light years away of Trifid's nebula at the shooter's constellation.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three - edged, three - sectioned), as dark dusts divide into three parts the torn heart of the gyre of the stars.

Anyone who doesn't like the technical abbreviations might call it the Southern Cemetery Circle.
A photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of Iris's nebula at the Cepheus constellation.
The haze removed by 1,400 light-years consists of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than normal domestic dust.

This star nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The starship is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, also constantly creates new stars - 5,000 light-years away from the Earth.
There's no dust in this brightly shining galaxy with a little black hole, just gas.
Researchers assume that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was largely hydrogen.
Our View of the Universe: Critical Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey, even before Galileo Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescope mirrors have grown larger and deeper and more accessible.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory of San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror here was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, U.S.A., there's a Big Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
Gran Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device - a mirror only diameter of 10.4 metres.
South Africa's Large South African Telescope is segmented for lowering cost.
Nevertheless, it can reach about 11 meters in diameter.
Lack of cost-effective design: the telescope is rigidly attached to a vertical angle, limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
It's a special feature: high light-sensitivity.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the largest world telescopes.
By means of a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
A radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
By participating in the Earth-Method Finder (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing his computing power.
View of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
There's a "Very large telescope" that's completely consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors allow even the medium infrared spectrum to be lighted in a visual tube.
The ESO, in Chile, is also planning the installation of the European “Grand Telescope”.
Its main mirror must be 42 meters wide and must be made up of almost 1,000 mirror cells.
Photographs, however, should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors 10 meters in diameter.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into the sky with the help of Soubaro and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a mirror diameter of 30 metres, should be available on Mauna Kea.
Here they can enjoy illustrations.
However, the most important species in space are the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has presented pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system — above all those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 planet candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
The latest preparation of the Kepler Space Telescope has been photographed.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space no earlier than 2018 on board the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the Big Bang around the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest there is ice on the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence of this, as Messenger is turning closer to the north pole of the planet.
The random measurements for decades indicated that there was ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe launched in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now convinced of this.
Drink butter every day - and live to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the Bible of honorable age.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
A search for clues in a country where 97-year-olds seem still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the Bible of honorable age.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
A search for clues in a country where 97-year-olds seem still relatively young.
A trip across the Talish Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus is pounding along the windy road past densely forested hills, brown words, and simple peasant homes.
It's so green and bright that you might think you're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost country of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometres from here.
There are Talashis, one of the peoples of the Caucasus, who is known for a little, except that they speak perfectly on the farsi and the Azerbaijani and have a long life.
The end point is Lerick.
The small town is filled with too heavy an architecture of Soviet times that is out of harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists hardly come here; the road from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, is too busy.
It takes eight hours to get 323 km, since the road has only one lane.
The mythical wealth that the country owes to the Caspian Sea oil, here to the province, has not yet arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lérica.
"May Baku is famous for its Eurovision festival -- and next year we'll have a festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulaev.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
A biographer of about eight dozen of these places, over 100 years of age, points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, 120 years old.
At 136 years of age, he had another child
But the controversial star of the museum is the Chaban of Shirley Mouslumov, who was supposed to be 168 years old.
No birth certificates, however.
And given that the oldest person whose age was confirmed by the documents was 122 years old, the age of Mouslumov was extremely questionable.
"He was born here in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 years he allegedly had a daughter.
So has the chabana of Mouslums added a couple of decades to its age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholtz, a researcher at Max Planck's Institute in Rostok, heard about the long-term residents in Central Asia.
"Almost many older people can also be found in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholtz, "there are also very many very old people living in Sardinia."
However, due to the absence of documents, it is not possible to provide scientific evidence of age since there are no civil registers.
Every day a glass of crushed oil
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area of Lerick are strikingly often reaching the Bible age.
Now there are 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many long-lived here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the fatish.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatulaev Museum believes it's food.
Talls like meat, bread, and milky foods, many of them drink a glass of pop butter every day, but it is unlikely that such a high-caloric diet can be healthy from a dietal point of view.
Or is it about the original way of life that keeps people young, in Chengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerick, where Rubab Mirzoev lives?
By 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaev, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter, and she's rolling around and out.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva’s sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
Two babies are also about to jump around.
In the kitchen, guests prepare tea that is served in typical chubby glasses.
Mirzaev's got perfectly flat and strong white teeth, under her head covering, she's hiding the long, dark russian scythes that her son proudly opens up to us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept their color.
"And I've never used shampoo," says Mirzaeva.
The monthly pension is sufficient for life
She always ate only things that grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought food in a store in my entire life.
Then she tells of her husband, who was serving in the army.
The hardest part was after the Second World War.
But it got better when the "loving father" Haydar Aliev got up at the wheel.
Propaganda doesn't often sound in an old woman's speech.
However, the cult established around the figure of the father of the nation, which ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knew little or no boundaries.
He was in power until 2003 and then received his son Ilham.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
230 manats (approximately the same amount of Euro) Mirzaev receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions it is an amount for which to live well.
And perhaps the long-standing son of Mirzaev is also right: "The elderly in our culture have great respect."
They live in a large family, loved, caring, and happy.
There's no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human rights” is not found in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal a profound division of the country.
The future Constitution based on the Shariah has met with fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president did not buy the pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to the god," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but especially to Christian Coptics, liberals, educated Muslims and nonreligious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in a lost opposition, are in fear.
Fear of a religious state in the Nile for the mercy of powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohammed Murcy, almost apologizing, said that he had temporarily curtailed the competence of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competence “to save the revolution”.
But what really wants to do is to save a 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate degree from the American University of South California, is not very clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of its power?
In fact, 234 articles were carried out in a 15-hour night jump, with obstacles to an Islamicist assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judicial process is based on “the principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and remains an interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use vague language and the legal luxuries resulting from it to make the Shari ' a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
At least this is implied by one new article: in all Sharia cases, Al-Ashar University, the country ' s most important Islamist institution, with great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be invoked for the Council.
This should not, but may mean, that the clergy are in charge of the law, which would de facto have the effect of limiting the judicial power.
In the draft constitution, much was interpreted
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to military courts must be maintained.
These courts, during Mubarak ' s reign, served to suppress the opposition.
Up to 11,000 civilians were held in military detention after the dictatorship was closed.
As stated in the draft, the State must also protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “support its morality and values”.
This is legally so vague that public institutions can control even the contents of films and literature by means of this article.
This means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article directly establishes equality between men and women.
But another forbids the insult of the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what such an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful that the “injury of people” is prohibited.
Will there be enough cartoons for the president or a legal joke?
The question of interpretation, as much as in this draft, which Murcy proposes for signature and which he said would “very soon” be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The Revolution Is Returned."
For several weeks, opposition against the superiority of Islamists has been formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unity on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who was third in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution was “in the dump of history”.
Through short news service Twitter, he accused Mursey's supporters of wanting to lead a "putch against democracy".
"If he declares the referendum, we will go to his palace and drop it," said opposition man Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged," quoted Egyptian media as the opposition policy of Khaled Ali.
Many judges also indicated that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would render it null and void.
"Coran is our constitution."
Well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, from caution, not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
A large number of women took part in the campaign under the coverings of the Salafites, who shouted: “The people require the application of God's law.”
They demanded of Murcy, "Cure the country," and they said, "Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which it all began has led to a state of almost civil war.
Murcia’s followers evidently did not want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brothers stated that both the opponents and supporters of the draft Constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to allow the people to decide at the ballot box where the country should go.
Most of the Islamists' project, this is considered to be a settled case.
"The notion of human rights is never mentioned."
Hafiz Abu Saeda, furious at this violent constitutional process, which was, in fact, supposed to last until February, with the participation of all the public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (ELODP) defended Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or tried at Mubarak.
Not because he shared their world view, but because human rights were indivisible.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
Now, the words “human rights” never appear in the new Constitution, he regrets talking to Welt am Sonntag.
Morsey ' s increased influence on all three branches of government in the State is disappointing to counsel.
These measures are clear attacks on the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Rather than to strengthen the civilian State, the de facto President abolished it”, said Saeda.
Without civil society organizations, democracy could not function.
Said feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, looking at the ideological struggle in the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
A payment could come for that.
A demonstrators in Tahrir Square warns, "You're creating a monster that you can't control."
Norwegian seashell: The most foolish smelling fish in the world?
The Norwegian population has one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Is the secret of the success of that country somehow connected with local addiction to one extremely vicious fish?
Take a few pieces of cheese that are too late.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll be able to smell the smell of cancer, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours away from Oslo.
It's beautiful, but there's an indescribable smell in the air.
Raqfisk is a trout that is salted and wandered in water until one year, depending on which shower is to be obtained.
As the dead and the cold grow, Norwegian crowds gather at a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, say, something that captures the food.
"She eats raw and is impregnated with a rye of acaverit, a local diminutive", explains Havard Khalvarsen, a local firefighter in the profession and in the community of the "Rakfis General" who manages the festival.
All around us, people eat small - sized fish and infuse them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people like aquatics better than cancer," said Havard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not that bad, but it's very different from the amount of land you've been carrying on a bus for a long time.
Cancer is a Norwegian product from quite different times, a time of poverty, when, even before refrigerators appeared, fish were wrapped in hermetically closed barrels of salt water in autumn.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish were well and thoroughly fertilized, they were taken out, and drinking was suppressed.
In memory of the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of employment and to emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly, with more than 13 per cent of immigrants being employed, high wages and a well-developed social security system.
The people of Sweden (an ancient rival, and not too long ago, and a much more wealthy neighbour) are coming to work here.
Cancer is seen as an important symbol, a permanent, albeit somewhat vicious, element of Norway ' s past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it's expensive -- a small glass of beer or a sandwich is going to cost you £9 ($14).
Norway rarely appeared in the world's news, and most of the country's inhabitants seemed to be happy.
People are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Braywick, a right-wing racist and extremist who last year shot and killed 77 men, women and children.
Without reference to his name, the terrorist attack is referred to as “the 22nd of July”.
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens has proved capable of such atrocities and killings.
Norway ' s current well-being is based on the growth (from the beginning of the seventieths) of one of the world ' s largest oil and gas industries.
"However, oil isn't the only cause of our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, bringing in trays with a worn-out sink, a woman with long hair and amazingly blue eyes, the realization of Nordial well-being.
We are indeed a people of understanding, as you call it.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks excellent English.
We don't like to show, we're not bragging.
Norway was very careful to treat its oil - most of the oil and gas revenues were invested in a special fund established for the benefit of future generations.
During the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was scavenged with money they didn't have, Norway carefully calculated all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and go camping in the summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a cancer," she adds with careless laughter.
I'm standing in the snow waiting for some food. I've had enough of it.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat -- it's definitely exotic, delicious juice meat.
But we still have more of the same fish in the evening, with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel, I have a special dinner on cancer, during which visitors will vote on the best or perhaps most aromatic fish.
There's a live telephy that shows the lead in a side-to-side tie surrounded by cancer plates.
It's like a song contest called "Euriion".
"So, Tor-Jurgen, what is your estimate of the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off the chair, maybe taking over the acquis.
Or maybe just by smelling the fish.
The President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, has a difficult career to start.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take office, BC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and at the mixed expectations of his country ' s population.
The traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad right now.
This city has been overloaded by transport and at a better time, and steel barriers have been built since Monday, cutting several key roads to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent the protestors from entering the parliamentary building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will wear a presidential bandage and accept the challenges of government.
He has a challenge.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance under the administration of the Philadelphia Calderón, which was now dethroning, but it had become embroiled in the war on drugs, which had already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government expresses its readiness to fight violence to the people of Mexico”, Mr. Peña Nieto earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto, President of the United States, had developed his political career as Governor of his native state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital city, views were divided about the new leader.
A Straight-Lined Man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents commend it for the revitalization of tourism, the development of resorts and the building of infrastructure.
One of Mr. Peña Nieto ' s new highways, which was built, is very different from the roads with holes and holes previously built.
His name is displayed on a modern sports centre building and on an impressive interactive museum devoted to climate change.
“We share with him the hopes of real and serious change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman led by Peña Nieto, an institutional and revolutionary party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, particularly in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous power, the PRI party was expelled in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olivera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos Presidential Palace, the party has high expectations in Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also refutes the allegations of lack of control that the new President of the opposition has made.
He is very direct and very committed to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
It's a great statesman, and above all, a good listener.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea about the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualcootl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast with the paved streets of Valle de Bravato.
Hidden under highways, it is, in many ways, the suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe.
Earlier this year, troops had been engaged to calm down drug-trafficking gangs in those areas; violence against women was particularly acute.
Several dozen bodies of killed women have been found in the desert near an extensive landfill in the last two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico State during the Governorate of Mr. Peña Nieto, a figure significantly higher than that of the notorious violence in Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become grueling when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to the opponents, Mr. Peña Nieto, it could best be said that he had not been able to deal with the problem of killing women during his term as governor.
At worst, his administration was accused of ignoring the problem completely.
A woman living in a concrete house that resembles most of the houses in this destroyed neighborhood, Irenaea Buendia has difficulty holding back tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I got to her house, her body looked like it had been washed away," recalled Ms. Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body was already beheaded.
Mariana's mother tells the story, and her daughter's portrait looks at us from the wall, where he's hanging next to the crucifixion, which has just one word: justice.
That was what they said was denied to the family.
"The officials of the state treated me like an old gossiper, an unhappy breaker of peace.
They want people simply to accept everything they say and to slow down.
But it's wrong, and it's not possible, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around us," she says.
On Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on heavy responsibilities with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes, and the new President has promised to make this issue a priority during his reign.
“I hope he will be exactly the same President as the Governor,” says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, this is what the victims ' families in Ciudad Nesa fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the ill-treatment, he claims.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning ' s stay in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires the closure of the case on the grounds that the conditions of Manning ' s detention were harsh.
The U.S. Private Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, had not availed himself of many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he claimed he had to undergo while in a military prison.
During the pre-trial interrogation in Fort Mida, Maryland, the Military Prosecutor, Major Ashden Fein, stated that the records of the weekly visits to Manning by the prison authorities in nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
Cross-examined as part of the defence ' s appeal for the termination of the Manning case, on the grounds that his conditions of detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment, was held the day after Manning had stated that he had intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 was accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents during his service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks resource did not confirm that the source of the information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, the Fein Prosecutor, together with Manning, reviewed the reports that had been filled after the visits of the administration to Manning during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was in strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his responses.
When Prosecutor Fein asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he valued treatment by the prison administration as “precious” and general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized”.
The reports under consideration do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, although Manninga was directly asked about his conditions of detention, Feyn claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed his oral concern about these issues and that the authorities who visited him had discussed these issues with him and had stated that they would be dealt with but not recorded in writing.
"They wrote no "problems," but that doesn't mean I didn't raise the subject in a conversation," says Manning.
A military judge, Colonel Denise Linde, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a meeting of a commission dealing with suicide intentions, which he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that during that meeting he wanted to be removed from the “prevention of injury” regime and eased conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that a limited regime of detention - below the level of supervision for the prevention of suicide - had been introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm okay with them to stop the trauma prevention regime... so that my standard of living could improve, in my view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait and that one day he had lost consciousness because of the heat.
He explained that it is very difficult when you are not told how your destiny is handled and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world has appealed to Camp Arifjan's base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cage."
While in Quantico, Manning said that he spent most of his time in a small cell, at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day, alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only his mattress, blankets, slippers, a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says that he tried to move because sleeping or even lying in the daytime prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep he was constantly struck by the light coming out of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face as he turned around in bed at night, he said he was woken up and forced to turn around.
The Manning lawyer filed a formal objection to the ill-treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manninga was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he had made during his testimony on Thursday that, after one night he had been forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, he had been forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners on an morning check.
Manning stated that he was unable to cover the blanket during the inspection.
In response to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he had to drop blankets that he could cover up but admitted that no one had explicitly ordered him to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning claimed that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not in danger.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could use a rabbit rubber or a slap to injure himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he was going through while in detention and significantly reduce the sentence if Manning was found guilty by the military court, which was due to commence his trial at the beginning of the following year.
The defence stated that it planned to offer Manning a confession for less serious crimes and to challenge other charges as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and it is expected that the prosecution will insist that conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was detained in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of detainees under the strictest possible regime.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, facilitating illegal publication of data on the Internet, transmitting information related to national defence and stealing State property or documents.
If convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My national self-determination crisis is a story from a Mexican American.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of their lack of self-fulfillment.
The Mexicans are inclined to blame those who have left because they remind the Mexicans of difficult times.
Rubén Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are breaking up between two cultures.
During a recent visit to Mexico City, I walked down the arriving corridor, approached the border control zone, and found myself on the spot.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicoanos (Mexicoans), the other for Extranjeros (Foreigns).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I was called Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional title, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and their friends in New York think they're Italian.
I later referred to the complex design of "American of Mexican Origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I picked up my American passport and lined up for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
Issues on the agenda were common to the meetings of the Presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto was eager to talk about the upsurge in Mexican economies, which would enable Mexicans to remain in Mexico with the same success instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and establish a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
President Peña Nieto also promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and fulfilled old issue.
Most Americans never thought that the United States had invaded Mexico in 1848 and had driven its leaders to abandon half of its territory under the barrel of rifles.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and they see reminders of those events in all things.
Therefore, it is only up to a U.S. official to make a complaint against Mexico, the press and the elite of Mexican society that Americans are violating the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And Montezuma's descendants are violent.
Mexico's relationship with more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States is the most complex.
Do you want to talk about resentment?
That's enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in that country and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, there were so many people of Mexican descent for one reason alone: at some point in their family history, someone -- father or grandfather -- was unable to realize himself in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a particular type -- striped, uneducated, poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
It's different in Mexico.
Today, our lives are the essence of America's dream, we've been in good schools and we've got good jobs, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider its own.
United States of America.
Moreover, we know that most members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same way.
They see in us a reminder of the humiliating defeat and treat us as second-class people, as untrue Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico aren't strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failures.
If our ancestors had been successful in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
We wouldn't be behind a silk curtain right now, finding a good life in the United States, but we lost our spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalyara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there is some tension between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin -- Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Americans of Mexican origin are offended.
She is a U.S. national and believes she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my familiar Mexican Americans do not feel belonging to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican team Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springston.
When you get the best in two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico we're Americans.
And in the U.S., we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during my visit, as if our relationship was not sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish their relationship with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to be Mexican ambassadors and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how wonderful it is to visit it, and we could persuade political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It won't work.
Too much resentment in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country to be so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for the way they dealt with Mexico a century and a half ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still offended by the way they treated their relatives in Mexico most recently.
Yeah.
Maybe we have more in common than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas can be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
The usual, senseless disputes over who started the first time; many buildings were turned into ruins; over 140 Palestinians, the majority of whom were civilians, and six Israelis, were killed; for the first time in the course of the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip fell in the vicinity of Israel ' s capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although the Israelis and the Palestinians have been hopelessly tied in their age-old conflict, the Middle East has seen a change.
This can be said in different ways, but the events of the Arab Spring have surrounded many persistent realities in the insurgency, and Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay away from the whirlwind that rocked the region.
Perhaps, as a result, their fight will become even more bloody than it was before.
There are, however, reasons for hoping to break this deadly impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, the situation does not seem to give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, signed on 21 November, is being implemented, the clashes that took place this week have only strengthened the positions of the militia on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement that came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007 will claim that they forced Israel to retreat despite their losses.
Despite the fact that some faction leaders have been destroyed and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements increases in the Arab world, Hamas has new, powerful and rich friends.
The reviving regional leader of Turkey, once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States in the Persian Gulf.
The solemn supporters of Hamas claim to have established an Islamist lunar around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by the Hezbollah paramilitary group, to Syria, where the increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad ' s power, and further to Jordan, where the king ' s allies threaten Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood was strengthened under President Mohammed Murcy.
Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 30 years and had been overthrowed in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas support.
The Muslim brothers are, on the contrary, an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas can become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced, even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the hard line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli iron dome missile system justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of Hamas-launched missiles.
Israeli citizens can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its stand; many European countries had also blamed the beginning of the last round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly under the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004 by rockets fired from Gaza, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombings, partly through the wall that enters the West Bank of the Jordan River — a significant part of an unrecognized Palestinian State — and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu ' s position, whose party Likud - in preparation for the 22 January elections - has been merged with more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Liberman, is very comfortable.
What is the point of condoning the Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If they were given over to all authority in the West Bank, would they not begin firing missiles from there towards Israel, as they were gathered in the Gaza Strip?
It's better to hold them behind the wall and severely suppress any attempt to lift their heads.
A hard line might win; however, its calculation could be refuted by the Arab Spring.
While Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere, do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be their domestic problems.
Israel ' s defence budget is larger than all its Arab neighbours combined.
Warfare with the regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursi, who worked with Barak Obama to put a ceasefire on hold, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, to a lesser extent, take into account the long-term implications of its policies.
As democratic changes have taken place in the Arab countries, the denial of the right to self-determination of the Palestinians constitutes a time bomb that will sooner or later explode in the occupied territories of Israel, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression was already undermining the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension of Arab population growth was only exacerbating those problems.
The bloody operations carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement must be paid for by the international community ' s growing discontent.
Both parties need an external impulse
There is only one solution that is consistently called upon by sound representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States and Israeli concessions of territories in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will enable other countries to have a more effective impact on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which had long overdue decided to stop arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, and Turkey and Qatar had a more favourable position than ever in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the boundaries of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the sharing of the territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries must also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more for the establishment of a Palestinian State than the forthcoming vote in the United Nations, which could result in recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama also has a role to play in placing Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to demonstrate his reluctance to engage in a solution to the problem.
It is a disastrously shortsighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The Uniform Packing Act for cigarettes entered into force in Australia.
Smoking warnings and images of diseased body parts are contrasted with those in the drooping green boxes, which are the same for all brands of cigarettes.
Australia ' s first-ever law on single-type cigarette and tobacco packaging has entered into force, replacing logos and various stamps with the same obsolescence and olive boxes with ghastly images of disease-affected parts of the body and images of children whose health has been damaged by their parents ' smoking.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions warning against the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packages that were necessarily introduced on this Saturday is the names of stamps that are printed in the same small type.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for the manufacture of tobacco packages.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to prevent young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion.
This solution was based on studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26 are 99 out of 100 never becoming smokers.
“It is obvious that even when children are very young, they understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging,” explains Health Minister Tanya Plybersek, referring to studies showing, for example, that the logo crown is associated with children with the message of princesses.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest share of smokers in the world, so that these changes do not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
The tobacco industry has been strongly opposed to the enactment of the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will have serious consequences different from those that were intended by its proponents,” says Scott McIntyre, representative of the British American Bank in Australia.
The producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will deliver many more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the other hand, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha, of the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for portfolios and silicons hiding unpleasant images on the package has increased rapidly (practically from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacac, British Imperial Toba account, Philip Morris and Japan Tobaca lost their case in the High Court of Australia, where they tried to challenge the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold some 6,000 products to wholesalers and is awaiting a new shipment.
It's a good business for us.
The potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures was, in the opinion of the experts, the popularity of social networks among the very population to which the measures were directed.
Following the enactment of a number of laws in Australia that made the illicit television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sports activities, as well as the ban on the display of cigarettes in public, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited local companies and websites from publishing online advertising, but it cannot limit it to foreign websites.
“If you are a tobacco dealer and you have only this little loophole left, the idea of promoting your product on the Internet will seem very appealing to you,” explains Becky Freeman, a researcher of public health at Sydney University.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of brand reviews written on behalf of alleged ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the case of a ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro's cigarettes so much that he has spared no effort and time and made a video, or is it worth the advertising company?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco states that the industry is now more involved in adapting to new regulations than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations: these States are filing claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small.
A WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plebersek, the Government has discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory installation of smoke warning photographs.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia have shown no sign of innovation.
Those pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"Just picking up a cigarette and hiding a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Haeg, buying cigarettes with a picture of the mouth tumors on the pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yo, the manager of the tobacco store King of the Package in central Sydney, claims that the same package made it difficult to place the goods in the shelves.
"I had an hour to unload my new batch, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, and then we would say, well, it's over, closing the store," he said, throwing his hands up.
It's not that bad to miss electronic networks and permanent connections in the world.
I had to spend five hours at the airport on this Thanksgiving Day because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to reflect on the nature of boredom.
I'm not lying to you.
Half-days at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and neither books, nor magazines, nor iPhones, nor even duty-free shops will be very helpful.
Recently, however, more and more child development scientists and specialists have expressed their preference for boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not too bad for us and for our children to miss.
This causes the brain to become distracted by interesting and related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since all of us in today's world are constantly in front of any screen, the benefits of boredom pass by us.
Is it necessary for us to strive for boredom?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll get back to this.
I used to think, like many, that boredom was an invention of relatively recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, claims Peter Tuy, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, by Boredom: A Live History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can boast a very ancient story," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii, there were Latin pictures of boredom dating from the first century.
However, the question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Istwood, associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom have often changed.
After studying research papers on this topic and asking a question to a target group of 100, Professor Istwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: Boring is when people “want but are unable to do what they would like to do”.
The difference between boredom and apathy, he said, was that a bored person did not do something that he would like to do.
I don't want to do anything when I'm apathetic.
The main problem, he said, was “the attention loss and the resulting deterioration in mood and the feeling that time was running slowly”.
According to the description of boredom, it may seem very like depression.
However, Professor Istwood argues that, despite the possible link between these conditions, the causes of the problems in the world and the circumstances are perceived by those who suffer from depression.
Sometimes we think we're bored when, in fact, we're just having a hard time focusing on something.
In his study "The Unemployed Mind: A Definition of Attention Boredness", published in the September issue of Personals on Psychological Science, Professor Izwood and his colleagues refer to a previous experiment that heard the voice of the reader.
Some participants also heard loud sounds that were not relevant to the television program included in the next room, others heard the same sounds in low volume, so they could hardly be addressed, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without a foreign audio track.
Those who heard low volume television said they were bored, more often than not, they found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reason for it and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, it can be boring, says Mark J. Fenzke, associate professor of neuroscience at Gvelf University, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting “e.g. by looking into the stream of articles on the conveyor in search of a marriage, a distraction can help to avoid boredom”.
It's thought to go on and on, that when people start to roll on a chair or draw doodling on a piece of paper, they're doing it out of boredom, but now we know that it's actually just helping them not to relax physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not prohibited from erzatting and turning are better at learning and remembering more information than children who are required to sit modestly,” claims Professor Fenzke.
At some point, all of us are bored: if the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people demonstrate a different degree of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “coupling wall” to measure such individualities.
Questions and allegations, such as “Much of what I have to do, uniformly and monotonously” or “I'm too interested, so there's not enough time for anything” are used to determine the assessment on such a scale.
By means of such questionnaires, researchers have determined that boys are more likely to miss girls,” says Stephen Vodanović, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular when there are a variety of external irritants.
In general, however, adolescents are often bored.
In 1991, Reid Larson, professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day with the help of a pager.
He obtained the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored in school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside school.
Only 3 per cent of parents, however, said that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he doesn't have any data on what he would have been like now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescent age is the peak of boredom”, mainly because children and adolescents are prevented from fully deciding what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: how useful is it?
Sometimes not, for extremes show that it can lead people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling, or the misuse of certain substances in attempts to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodaniewicz, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; it's boring," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But this brain doesn't always know what's best to do.
If you're bored and you put that energy on a guitar game or cooking experience, you'll do better.
But if you watch TV, you'll only be better off for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So if your child is bored and you give him iPad, he'll stop missing, but he won't learn to fight boredom alone or in any other way manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenzke.
“And these self-regulatory skills are used in a wide variety of situations,” he states.
Your child learns not only to do things on his own, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think we should get bored.
But it shouldn't be considered a bad thing either.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even beyond the continuous flow of actions and technologies.
Professor Idwood agrees.
“We see it in such a way that we need to be bored more often, and boredom is a very unpleasant, inexorable desire to do something meaningful,” he said.
In fact, people are trying to get out of constant anxiety and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to constantly overindulging in our senses," he says, "and when it's quiet, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
So far, it is not clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana will be applied in Colorado
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team player and a college student in the south-eastern state of Colorado, are accused of committing a criminal offence that will soon be totally legal throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and a tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that he and his friends had been in Lamara one day and had been driving a car along the prairie near the border with Kansas when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in a car, Mr. Orosco came to the court for possession of drugs and drug-use equipment - minor offences, for which a fine of $100 was due - and the date of the trial was set.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has continued for several weeks since Colorado voted in favour of legalizing the use of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, hundreds of minor cases depend not so much on the law as on the place of the proceedings.
The charges of minor marijuana offences have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, D.C., which has taken similar measures.
Police stations have already stopped charging people 21 years of age or older for possession of small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law enters into force in a few weeks.
However, in more conservative regions of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to deal with existing marijuana cases and continue to be held accountable for possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous regions of the West, there is a vote to prevent the emergence in their places of new, licensed marijuana shops.
"It's all going so fast that I don't even know what to wait for," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora east of Denver.
The Washington State supervisory authorities are also puzzled about their heads.
They will have to establish regulations for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is ahead of most other states in solving marijuana issues, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“There is a more orderly market in Colorado, so they will set a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Council for the Regulation of Alcohol Production and Marketing in Washington State.
But no one is able to do more now, recognizes Mr. Smith than to put forward proposals and hope that this will work.
“We don't have a real precedent to guide us,” he said.
The Washington State Bill, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and for a year will bring the state into a state of uncertainty when there are no State licensing systems and the right of possession of marijuana has already been legalized.
And there are still difficult technical issues that need to be addressed during this period, such as how to balance the state's “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana with a ban on trading 1,000 feet away from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to locate licensed marijuana trading companies in the urban area, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of the newly established research group “Centre for the Legalization of Marijuana”.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police, Outs of Aurora, sent an e-mail message to his subordinates that the Public Prosecutor's Office would no longer hold persons under 21 years of age accountable for possession of a small number of marijuana, and that the police would stop putting people to account for these violations “from now on”.
The Chief of Police of Outs said that the police would monitor the implementation of the regulations governing the activities of medical marijuana growers in the city and prosecute illegal drug traffickers and distributionrs.
The prosecutor of the Weld District in north Colorado, Ken Buck, is a more stringent approach to this issue.
Following a vote on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor's Office would continue to prosecute the possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage users of marijuana.
At this point, 119 persons are charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused of other violations.
“The duty of our institution to prosecute what is considered criminal at the time of their commission”, said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was mixed, even in places such as the Mesa Rural District, where voters rejected the legalization of marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the district, no longer hold adults accountable for possession of small quantities of drugs.
The district prosecutor, Pete Houtzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to remove charges in pre-open cases involving marijuana storage.
“I believe it is our direct duty to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 per cent of the people in Colorado who voted supported the decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the State and the legal system would not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of residents in different states has revealed the mixed attitude of the local authorities towards the state's marijuana experiment.
“The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this regard,” explains Sean McAlister, a Denver lawyer representing the prisoners for the possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've been after people for so long for this that they can't really accept this as a crime anymore," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to consider a small number of marijuana as much as alcohol, are designed to be a pilot field at the national level to test the very idea of drug legitimization.
Legalization advocates and state officials are planning to expand the area of legalized trade, but they are at the same time waiting with opium for instructions from the federal authorities, who continue to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Supporters of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will give way to this issue.
Despite several widespread arrests of medical marijuana dealers and patients, the federal government has in most cases been good at the medical sale of marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The Counter-Narcotics Bureau's agents are unlikely to break into their homes to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to state-controlled recreational marijuana shops, which are permitted by the new law, in the view of Kevin A. Sabeth, a former anti-narcotics adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not await federal action.
Even before the presidential elections, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops, which could not have opened earlier than a year later.
Last week Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the sale of marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
A great many outstanding issues remain.
Petrella Wyatt: I was rescued from Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As long as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, the modern equivalent of an ancient symposium that lay the two pillars of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the History School of Wooster College of Oxford University at the end of the '80s, I gathered the suitcases and left, which turned out to be the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson was joking about me leaving because I had to drink from scooping cups.
It wasn't that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran because I was systematically disciplined and intimidated.
It's not because of my rather unusual name or because I was in a private school.
I was disciplined only for one reason, and in this famous cradle of enlightenment, it looked like a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now Woodrow Wyatt's late father, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Tetcher, and I myself was a supporter of conservatives.
You're gonna ask me, why remember that now?
According to recent data, a new generation of law-based students are subject to the same kind of digestion.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of Conservative Students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those granted to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at the Cristy College College College in Cambridge state that they are “often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and making themselves feel unwelcome” because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the Committee on Equal Rights of the College in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation has only aggravated the recent BBC 2 documentary film on the policy of the student environment, "Strange of Miracles: Young, Smart and Right," in which conservatives were represented by extremists and neo-Nazis.
The film showed Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who rides in Rolls, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver cap.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are making "free-go goats" because of higher school fees.
Luke Black, 20, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservatives Association, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper, said that “in the university environment, there is an increasing bias towards left-wing views.
People who don't even know us, in advance, consider us to be impudent and violent children of wealthy parents.
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the History School of the College of the Cristie Corps, in which an application for protection was filed, called the atmosphere "unsight," and Stephanie Cheryll, 19, a new president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, said that the relationship of students to right-wing opinion holders had deteriorated considerably.
“It is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and the normal life of the members of the club,” she said.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just a minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986 with a doll and a shy 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford was hot with hatred for the conservative party.
A year earlier, the university had taken a vote to deprive former student Margaret Tetcher of her honorary degree because of a reduction in the budget allocation for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, it would be awkward even for the Stalins.
During the early days of the first week of the year, when the students got to know each other and the teachers, I felt what was ahead of me for the first time.
I didn't know that teachers were not only looking through their fingers at the digestion of conservative students, but they were happy to participate.
Political issues - mining strikes, privatization and the Government ' s opposition to sanctions against the Government of apartheid in South Africa - have crept through the wooden panels of the audience wall.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very pretty person with a face that looked like a cake.
"The Tethers don't really learn French or they just don't have enough brains?" he asked.
The other students snuck.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I tell you to take some early French lessons in free time, if of course you're not very busy turning around," Pitt said.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
I was sitting alone in college that night, and then someone patted me on the shoulder.
This was James, a second-grade student from the English language department who was introduced as a member of the University Conservatives Association.
'I know who you are,' he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives will be ridiculed.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher because you're gonna be more complicated.
Most of the first-year conservatives pretend to be Leborists."
Later, in the local pub, I was cowardly trying to be hypocritical.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher says.
The trick didn't work.
An elementary student in the Faculty of Philosophy, politics and the economy, who himself studied in Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
The other students took his words.
I was ruined, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?
- They're messing with each other, aren't they?
I felt as I must have felt as a homosexual before the abolition of criminal proceedings in the sixtieths.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with like-mindeds only under cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a Labourist and hide my true beliefs?
For the next three years, I felt like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only because he belonged to conservatives, but also because he was an adviser to Tetcher on foreign policy and one of her singers.
He didn't show up at college.
He despised his Provinciality, fineness and commitment to Marxist-determinist views of history.
In 1997, he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents ’ home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and open - minded capital friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and I explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies during the fortieth century, any political views were adopted.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said complaining.
- There's no such thing, but not in the city of drooping spying.
Even my Communist friends have always been perfect."
His wet eyes are gone.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You're gonna break my heart if you drop out."
I was exhausted by my regular travels to London, and my emotional defense was weak.
My friend, also a conservative, did not stand the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
During the following week's seminar, when another professor of history was very serious about calling me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the shower of shame, I admitted that "I was brainwashed by my parents," and I called them "old fools."
The break was short.
The last nail in my career grave at Oxford was to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Merdock.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed the case and boarded the first train to London.
I never came back.
You could call me a cry and a bunny.
But at the age of 18, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
Sadly, it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen Prime Ministers of Tori, but still hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of glory."
The exhibition "Valentino: Master of Neck," which opened this week in London, ABC is talking to Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen Bornemica and other prominent Italian designer clients
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of the Valentine Garvani exhibition.
The designer acknowledged this at the time of the discovery of Valentino: Master of Neck, a triumphal retrospective exhibition that combines more than 130 fashion dresses created by his home over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "il Signor" Garvani, but it could not have been written without his named clients.
Valentineo has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world.
In the first room of the exhibition, which was opened until March 3, personal letters and photographs signed by the most prominent aristocrats, from Princess Salama Ag-Han to Lord Snowyon, including Marie-Shantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain, are full of personal letters and photographs.
Valentineo shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise, from a modest port from Voger in northern Italy to an international “elita”.
Being in love with the Queen's Court is not wrong.
"They don't at least put out the smoking of their cigarettes about your magnificent carpet, like some beautiful pop stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentineo is an improbable host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all enjoyed coming to his shale in Gstaade," explains Haini Tissen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten handsomes like Marella Anelli or Evgenia Niarhos.
Valentineo has always preferred elegance of glory.
Even so, he's a star.
Valery Matsa, representing Valentineo
The Argentine model of Valery Macha reminds us of a charismatic model.
Once we went to his home dinner, it was after a fashion show in Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentine's style was manifest in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her dress, in her food, in her music.
"Each guest, Valentineo, felt important and loved," recalls the "top-model," which began its work with the modeler in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He's never getting out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art," she concludes.
New program %1
The life of Haravan is not a story of obsession, but of love with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous podium of 60 metres long, offering a change of role: the visitor takes the place of models and is required to defil the podium by using the “spectators” of the raffles, which make the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy has chosen for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the suit that Monica Witti used in The Night, or the coat of wool and skin that belonged to Emperor Far Dib.
This audience includes models such as Sibila Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn Und Taxis, Matte-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Nachi Abascal and the modeler, in 2006
Many of these customers say that Valentine's First Love, "can't be forgotten."
I remember him perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vests and jackets from the autumn collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Natie Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I commend him to the others for his femininity, for his great love for women because he highlights our beauty," adds former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses. They have a lot of light, and they're coming up to his face.
Proportions are perfect.
The Princess and the legislator of Patrick della Jovampaola d'Arendberg can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentine.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed I would have age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally came that hour in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress to wear it at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt, a box in the fold and a cut without a rope.
"It was a dream, a dream," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is not temporary," explains this Italian aristocratic who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D "Arenberg keeps his birthday dresses from the modeler with "maximum caution" because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a collection of memories accompanying it."
Fashion King
The Grand Final Exhibition at Somerset House, Mari-Santal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pauls from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “girls” (as the modeler of her sewing) to make this garment of silk from ivory with pearl increasing, 12 different kinds of circles and a four-and-a-half-metre plume.
According to journalist Susie Menquez, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a milestone in the late twentieth century fashion, “the return of clients from the higher world”.
For many years, the elite's “lifestyle” has become the best representative of Valentineo himself.
The Cavaler of the Great Cross (the highest rank in Italy), the Cavaler of Labour, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Verbality, awarded by the Order of the Honorary Legion, Garavani received as much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his elegance, his calmness, his neat and irreproachable appearance," recalls D'Arenberg.
Last time I saw him, a month ago, at a solemn dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was perfect, there's no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The world ' s hardest profession: Kawah Yijen miners
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health by pulling 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano on a steep stone path.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among these are Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living from sulphur mining in Kawah Yijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Each day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where sulphurous gas, rising from the depths of the earth, freezes in contact with the air.
The large pieces of sulphur, with a total weight of up to 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, pulls the baskets on his shoulders, and carries them upstairs on a rough stone road.
Although only 250 metres [250 m] to the top of a volcano, it takes more than 40 minutes for sophisticated trucks to climb a turtle’s foot, with difficulty holding the balance, and carefully finding a road so that they do not fall and fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as it did a French tourist who had broken off several years ago from the Kawah Yijen Rock.
Cavah-Yijen chess earns 5 Eurocent for every kilo of sulphur that is mined
Upon reaching the top, they lay their way between tourists, who photographed them, as if they were monkeys from the circus and were tired of heavy baskets, walking three kilometres to the weights that the mining company had placed slightly higher, at an altitude of 1,850 feet [1,850 m].
This is the PT Kandi Ngrambi, an enterprise that has operated this volcano since 1960 and, better not to say, its employees, who pay Rs. 662 (5 Euro cents) for each kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) of petrochemical production, since it is common in daily life and is used to produce matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar.
"Because the standard is a transfer of 70 kilograms, we earn about Rs. 46,000 (Euro3.8) per walk," explains Anto, who usually performs three daily transports.
It spends three hours each and feels broken at the end, but it allows it to store Rs. 138,000 (Euro11.5) by the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a micromanage for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would have earned in the field.
“The daily wages of miners are very high according to local standards, where the coffee collection costs Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2) a day and the average monthly salary is Rs. 2 million (Euro167)”, explains the cargoman who used to work as a stoner on the tourism island of Bali.
There his salary was Rs. 75,000 (Euro6.2) per day and the station was not as heavy, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwanga, a town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia was as destructive as Sera: “I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus were taking her to Java to accept Islam.”
Anto has asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes full of toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, Anto had spent three years risking his life in Kawah Yijen, whose sulphur had already begun to affect him despite the existence of a mask and special glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes coming down because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
It's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
With a life sentence, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter, or hotel port, but instead he does the work of a mule.
For a dirty wooden cabin with other porters, it stands every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulphur doesn't stop streaming at night, when its distinctive yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
In challenging the shadows, Anto goes down into the crater, lighting his way with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize sulphur production to save costs and did not provide any equipment to porters working in their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not even receive a portion of Rs. 30,000 (Euro2.5) of the photo collection, which, along with an entry ticket for Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2), is taken from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mulls.
“This is a job for livestock, not people,” claims Badresin, a root porter of 42 years, who has spent three decades in Kawah-Jen since he left college.
He's able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he's confident that he's going to endure work as much as he can, because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur burns down the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and the miners are caught in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so worn out that no one complains of his or her serious illness... more serious than their usual respiratory problems, arthrozes, knee pain and shoulder curvatures, which have been deformed under the weight of the basket.
In balancing the basket on his back, Uninnick can only lift 50 kilograms at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions remove 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the Tamansari warehouse, crossing an 18-kilometre-long path across the narrow tropics.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unynik, opening wide a mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, 30 years of age, he also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what humans do with Kawah Yijen.
Singapore Seeks Children to Save the Economy
Singaporeans accused career, stress and housing and education prices in the absence of children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriarch's wife, we're gonna do our civic duty and we're gonna make life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of mint blades, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put the bao in the oven" to make fun of Singapore's fertility rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that through advertising, they will be able to attract attention to the problem in a recreational way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfil their "national duty."
This thing is for the Internet only, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
That's the main problem in the country.
We are the world's worst replica of these, so we felt that this was the subject that we should be addressing.
We knew that the Government was trying to do a lot of things, such as launching perfumes with pheromons or organizing quick dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely, make a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take it lightly are the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to inspire citizens to have more children.
A State package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, renews maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has a low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city State in South-East Asia, also known for its conservatism of leadership and strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Authority, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 was known as the 1976 replacement rate.
So why do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Office of the Policy for Marriage and Families of the National Population Authority, said that the reason for “improved education” and “the broader range of career opportunities” was the reason.
“This has enabled people to have a broader range of options for life goals and priorities other than marriage and family creation,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
However, immigration policy, which aims at a sharp increase in immigration in order to counteract the population reduction, is a source of resentment among the local population.
Singapore has websites where there is little hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for low-level wages and for being reluctant to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the ruling party of Singapore obtained the worst result in elections since independence.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unanticipated consequences
While the fall in fertility has a significant impact on the nation ' s economic growth, tax revenues, medical costs and immigration policies, Singapore ' s example also begins to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government was working to ensure that so many small houses were not built.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Guide has begun to control the number of small apartments known as a shoe box that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These 46-square-metre apartments are very well sold.
Nevertheless, there is a view that they can contribute to the single life - style and deprive developers of the incentive to build large family housing.
But Lima Yu-sung, director general of a construction firm called EL Developers, says that their shoe boxes are sold much faster than larger copies.
They're more popular in that these apartments are purchased for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash revenues are increasing.
Nevertheless, he recognized that the new rules provided clearer guidance for developers, who had previously been obstructed if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the draft.
Too tense
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new regulations may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans working in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have much effect.
"People are too busy, housing is expensive, as is education, and that's why many people put it off," says a young manager.
Others may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man 20 years old.
Men and women refer to their career, stress and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from raising children.
So, no matter how the Government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, with regard to childbirth, the last word remains with Singaporeans.
Personal off-line - Personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, this is the private or “private sphere of life which has the right to be protected from any interference”.
What is personal to a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his day - to - day life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when discussing situations on the Internet that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine" on a personal basis, and "the password and name of the user," when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets wouldn't be post," says Ten-year-old Jorge, when she's trying to explain the meaning of personal information on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's got records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
On FB, I download beautiful pictures or games images.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or someone who was acting stupid," he said.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to publish unseemly images of naked people, crimes, or abusive or angry comments.
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he's got on FB and nine of his Folwers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows she has a password for one of the records.
I set up Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just download them," he adds.
"social networking is entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
Without thinking about it, he answers that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't think of anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
José's 14-year-old case is different.
This teenager has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know the 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music like that," he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him or asked his home address or phone number.
"If they pressure me or demand me, I'll just remove them from my record," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy has experience of what is now known as cyberbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on a social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not delete the record.
“Only included confidentiality”.
He then explains the sequence of steps to configure the record in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would download pictures of acquaintances in uncomfortable or convulsive situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like the person or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cyberbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marelos Porras, an English teacher and a specialist in education and education, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information, but these sites have changed the rules of the game," she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prenski, a professor of education at Yale University and a work author, has invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital Aborigines are them, the children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning," she says.
It explains that the topic is complex “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken about, at a time when maturity is insufficient to do so”.
"Also they should be electives, while most important to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to demonstrate the confidentiality of children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do this is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: some things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like to publish a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others publish about you?
When you sign pictures from a party, do you ask other people for permission to observe them?
And one more thing, should everyone know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to act online just as offline does.
The rules are the same.
“Outside the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as well as social media,” she claims.
Watchfulness
Estuardo Guardía, a university professor, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for heads of families to read the policies of social networks in good faith.
Having understood each point, they have good reason to talk to children about the prerequisites of opening an Internet account.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published”, he said.
According to Gurdiya, the key question is to remind children of the lesson "Don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR summit is ending without the Lima Declaration
The Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, which was declared by the previous and theoretically signed seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the VI ordinary summit of heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the President ' s Administration indicated on the front page that it would be transmitted after closure but then confirmed that it would be published at a certain point on the Peruvian Government ' s website.
In connection with questions about the text, they indicated that the contents had been presented by President Olyant Umala of Peru during brief press statements.
The access of journalists to information about the Summit has been limited all the time.
During the day, it was only broadcasted, in the press room, by a video of the Presidential Assembly, with no sound, saying “closed meeting, no sound”.
Few of the information that had been disseminated to reporters was transmitted by some UNASUR press secretaries present at the meeting, but not by Peruvian.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian President's administration sent an e-mail to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it is the Umala statement, rather than the official document that concluded the summit.
In the past October, Peru had adopted the Third South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been declared, had not been circulated, despite the persistent demands of the press.
On the official ASPA website, it is possible to verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had tried to ensure that all journalists were provided with transmission systems, but to the maximum extent possible, information was obtained.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the judgment of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olianta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinhera, met at a regional meeting and ratified the decision of the International Court of Justice, which starts on Monday in The Hague hearing the statements of both sides, in the context of the charge Lima brought against Santiago.
“We will comply with and implement a decision that will clarify the differences we are currently presenting to this international court,” said Umala, near his Chilean colleague.
“Who was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals”, Pinheer added, and welcomed the handshake of Umalu against the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by the two Presidents that they were subject to the International Court of Justice came immediately after Colombia had challenged this week the Bogota Pact, according to which it had found that it was subject to the verdicts of that international court following the decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a mistake.
The Summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christine Kirschner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011, following the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President, Olyanta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit just later in the afternoon.
The Head of State read the outcome document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects approved among the South American countries, with an investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which we are expanding the residence agreements”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “cooperation against citizens' insecurity and organized transnational crime, to increase access to medicines, to affordable Internet access in all parts of South America, and to take account of the combined and effective risk of natural disasters”.
Since Europe is in crisis, “the economic association (Latin America) should not have a triumphal base but should serve to expand our productive base and to anticipate a better future for our cities”, Umala added.
"We have decided to grant privileges to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the link between the spaces of South America, especially in the village and border zones... by bringing our countries together and forming new economic schemes," said the Peruvian President in a message he read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five belonged to Peru and were limited to cross-axiss on his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The outcome document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve as its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations”, from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have good relations between its neighbours, was another theme highlighted by the summit.
In that respect, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City, to negotiate in a respectful manner a maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogotá.
"The day after Saturday, perhaps I will meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“We will review all these paths, which are not mutually exclusive, including the covenant with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua”, he stressed.
"To President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we can deal with this as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico City on Saturday, where they will have a new President, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also at the summit, the defence ministers met provisionally to adopt the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Guyana, Suriname, Uruguay and Paraguay constitute UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe about the integration of citizenship: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common nationality is the goal in which “South America, in this case, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, stated to the Peruvian State Television that Europeans had “killed each other during the Second World War” and other clashes, “but now they are practically one father”.
It has protected, in this context, the South American Nationality Project, which is endorsed by the UNASUR participating countries.
“We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as has already been the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive sectors that want us back to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador has also shown support for the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) by reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who give lectures never commit themselves, and we South Americans sign everything.
“It is not clear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington, D.C., and is funded by the United States”, he stated, in his intention of political asylum, given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanjo.
Correa assured him that he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that “there had been some suspicion at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring it to come into its territory for questioning the alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law itself considers it possible to implement it through videoconference which could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of Assange ' s physical and mental health being damaged.
"I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our Embassy, but the Ambassador has informed me that he has had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
What is true is the risk of his physical and mental health being damaged due to the inflammation of a small space without the possibility of exercising in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution to the problem of asylum granted by Assanjo since June at the Embassy in London by providing security guarantees that would enable him to travel to Ecuador was in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating human rights; we are not using that word here, but we have had constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judiciary, because counsel Assanja, Baltasar Garson, conducts a number of trials in various European jurisdictions,” he mentioned.
And expressed the view that "If Britain offers the guarantee of security tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows it and as it has done in other cases, questions Señor Assanja at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates him in Skype, tomorrow the problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to show himself to be a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate “directity, dishonesty and lies which distort freedom of expression”.
"The chief enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt political villains, but bad journalists supporting profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard, he was pleased that neither these journalists nor “bankers nor hegemon bourgeois do dominate Ecuador” and added that, once re-elected, “it will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in UNASUR until at least next elections, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for revolutions under the rule of law” because, in fact, it “has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy”.
In addition, the President of Ecuador found his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos' wish to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime boundaries between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which had turned out to be in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
This decision is not being complied with at the moment.
It is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by a desire to go together.
They must be processed together to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed the hope that the maritime boundary dispute before the same Court of Peru and Chile would be resolved well and said that “it is appropriate for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if two countries commit themselves to making a decision, however serious it may be”.
Referring to the opportunity to stand as a candidate for the forthcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he said that he was considering it “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it was difficult”.
Correa assured him that if he lost in the elections in February 2013, he would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unjust situations such as Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be redressed only by political power.
"My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I had to accept that responsibility," he said.
If we won, it would be my last term as president, and then we leave public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"This is a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new treatment course for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I had just spoken to Vice-President Nicholas Maduro of Venezuela, who told me that he had gone to a treatment already planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss out on a campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean an increase in the state of health of President Chavez," he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS Today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabricio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test had had a positive impact.
"It's as if I've been deafened," he remembers the hard one, despite the doctor's treatment, the moment.
A young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified - he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Factory is one of the “old” patients of HIV-related hospital, Hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was found in 1994 and overcome many obstacles.
He's been living with a diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe that there were too few treatments, too few known about the disease, too biased about the sick.
So, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection clinic didn't want to say goodbye to him "because he had a cut."
In other words, AIDS was a sentence back then.
It is now possible to survive and do so without affecting the quality of life.
However, without knowing of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “a major achievement is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, noted the head of the HIV unit HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, pointing out that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infectious and expert, Andrada Villanueva, explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but that the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system available to patients at the start of diagnosis, with the best life expectancy for those who do not use drugs, up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 are reported.
Simply put, the above means that anyone who receives a diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “by maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to the age of 75”, he explained.
In order to measure that progress, it should be remembered that Mexicans today average 76 years of life expectancy.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS has fallen from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the outbreak of AIDS, 60 per cent of the patients in the national database have died.
In Khalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths had already been recorded by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why is there still a fatal outcome?
Personally, I don't think it's a problem to have access to treatment.
That's what I imagine. This is what's going on in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we haven't had a shortage of drugs, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He cited the devastating data: “Nine out of ten patients come when they already have an opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to be diagnosed earlier, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a mass scale, for all people who ask it.”
In their proposal, the experts and officials of the National AIDS Prevention Council in Khalisco (COESIDA) and the patients themselves, such as Fabricio, went to a private laboratory for inspection, motivated simply by a friend and despite his youth, he was already at the AIDS stage and even suffered from the Carcoma Caposhi, a cancerous tumor, which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die and don't want to know anything.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather do three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I exercise, I take drugs.
To date, his parents only know that he has undergone cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I'm working, I've got a lot of classes, I'm traveling, I'm active in sex, but with mutual responsibility, taking care of myself and another person," said Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENO JALISCO, in order to advance his statement to those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, afraid.
If there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV positive, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person who is responsible.
This presentation summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year.
Conquests by counter
The big gap between health programmes and a simple citizen is believed by Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalyhara who has dealt with HIV-related issues.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, “the actual increase in condom distribution, we were given one or two, now we're given 100 packages, and that's very good, but it turns out there are those who still don't have access to condoms”, he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you want them?" This is a popular question, with the scrupulousness and condemnation of social workers, school counselors, pharmacies and health workers who don't want to hear teenagers, assured the propagandist.
I suggest that this inefficient distribution be changed; that condoms not only be behind counters and that a hundred be in automatics in public toilets in places that young people often visit.
It's not the promotion of debauchery.
It was not about the payment of beer and motels, and Governor Emilio González replied when asked whether condoms could be distributed under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms accessible to those who already have sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Khalisco
A total of 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV) have been reported.
The state ranks fourth in the national rating for new and aggregate cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92 per cent of the infections relate to sex, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent through perinatal pathways.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, since there are between 4 and 5 registered people who do not know about it.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that cancels the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a critical precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country that has a capacity to pay problem.
It appears that procedures to support the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of lanes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the approval of the decision rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale in the North Texas Bankruptcy Court leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the order opens doors to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico for recourse to the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an entry, while the judge of the case notes that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, located in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings related to the competitive proceedings before Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
To that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law had been established, identifying the American Institute of Law as arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict stipulates that without the inter-firm vote recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt proceedings held by Vitro branches before the parent company, the majority necessary to approve restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, of which Agremex and Central Mexico, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that, by subtracting the votes of the branches, the lenders of Vitro who fought against it in the United States courts, namely, vulture funds, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The voting would be 45 per cent against 37.
These figures are dropped by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation faced since 2008, which has been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has faced when it strikes the country.
So far, González Sada's family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote can reach the plenary, five judges, given that only three have voted.
In the event of a failure, an application for a certificate would be filed, which would require a review by the highest court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
The worst part is that the court rejected a document sent by the Government of Mexico as amicus curiae (“a friend of the court”), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Proceedings Act, indicating that it exempts itself from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries in order to link it to article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, that is, the rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Two-board coroners hit Vitro and hit the country.
Total balance
In the light of several months of complaints filed on the desk by Mexicana de Avicion trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud, has already discovered a bottled throat.
The institution, led by Carlos Díaz Chavez Morino, has just submitted a criminal claim against the National Commission on Banks and Stock, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory body has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic concerning an operation performed by an employer to extract from the trust fund of IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed towards the purchase of shares of hotels by a professional management company.
As you know, Oscar Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Drawn Mart is surrounded by Dragon
Meeting on the weekend at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of general civil society endorsed the establishment of a broad front to counter the discovery of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, with a residential area near 150 companies.
In the past, Canacintra has been able to bring together governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces, which have compared part of the protected territories to land and pose serious threats against the industry.
ACTA Death
With regard to the Government's rejection of the Senate's requirement to explain under what circumstances and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan had signed the Trade Agreement on Counter-Falsation, known as the acronym on English ACCTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case had already been filed.
As you know, the action has been carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself has disqualified the opportunity to view it as a violation of the freedom of expression in social media.
Homex in the long term

Competival comes into light
Trained by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet enterprises, information technology leaders, the Competival trade name consortium has just emerged and will aim at marketing software clusters in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Hector Hetyn, a crazy basketball traveler, had been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to it, went around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And before the brain he was brainwashed into a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was involved in sports for more than 60 years, as a small player, as a player of the Higher Basketball League, as a commissioner and head of the BSN with the Bayamon Cowboys and President of the Federation of Basketball.
"I played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several times as I was President BSN, Director-General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during his visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball Was My Life."
Reyes isn't exaggerating when he makes that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all of them decorated with photographs and memorable things collected for his long journey, testify to this.
Bajamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he maintains those who remember his path through the Cowboy, from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old, as a co-agent or agent of the contract.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I had been able to be part of eight cowboy champions since 1967 as an agent, a co-agent, or a leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsy debuted in BSN.
From that point forward, Ortiz, who was a great administrator, continued to be the manager of the Cuko,” said Reyes.
I remember Jean Bartov, who went here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7".
"Do you want it?"
And this was the beginning of Minsk, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bart then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who was granted citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsi had brought the Baamon championship, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Championship with Houses, but it was a long way off, since by 1988 it was already the head of the federation.
By that time, I had preferred to enjoy his achievements and those of Minsie in a national assembly.
I remember how we won the first time in the United States during the 1989 Olympian qualification tournament in Mexico.
Then came the World Cup of 1990, where we got fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian judge who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, and she's the one who won Dream Theam at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and defeated the United States, which was pretty much the same as the one that won our bronze in the world championship.
Not only were Minsk, Gauss, Ramona Rivas, Fico López and Piculina (Ortisa), but young (Havier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, brothers León (France and Edgar) and Mario “Choote” Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 years because of knee trauma.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but which brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Tour in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-playing players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players temporarily suspended for disorder at the Mar del Plata Pan-American Championship, we won the gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculien did.
And that doesn't take into account his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Thoreau, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmão, Armandito Torres.
From young people, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most famous era of national assembly between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s, BSN had up to 17 crews in the season.
What do you need to do?
There were things I wanted to realize, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, only boys from Ponce play in their own fields and against teams from other parts of the island in national ple-off.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's too much.
At the very least, I see the results of compulsory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, I watch music videos from my age on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and I go to basketball games from time to time.
And of course, I'm enjoying my wife's society, Isabel, who's always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Haggman, born on September 21, 1931, in Fort Wert (Tehas), became world famous for his primary role as John Ross Yuing, better known as J.R., in the "Dallas" series, in which he represented a businessman without principle, evil or manipulation.
Larry Haggman, whose role as a vulture oil magnet, J.A. Yuing, in "Dallas", became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of "Dallas," died on Friday evening because of cancer-related complications, according to a family statement for The Associated Press by Warner Bros.
"Lary has returned to her beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the portentous role that he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at a fair to celebrate Thanksgiving.
Linda Grey, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the Sikwell, was next to Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her representative, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, gracious and talented, and I'll miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," said Grey in his statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and transferred to a transplant.
Long before "Dallas", Hagman gained prominence on television thanks to the role of a good-looking type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changing, when he meets an attractive genie girl played by Barbara Eden and starts living with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedy, which rarely appeared on the air, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His work in the movies included well-accepted critics in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his master's interpretation of the amazingly disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of glory.
The CBS drama series on the Yuing clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The ad, "Who shot at J.R.?", designed to make the noise around the episode, full of emotion, where Hagman's characters are almost killed, has given rise to international discussions and millions of dollars that were at risk in bookstorers' offices.
It also helped to draw a record audience to the show at that time.
When the November 1980 episode was answered, an average of 41 million TV viewers watched it and turned Dallas into a second-largest entertainment program in history, after the 1983 MASH finale, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R., Christine (in execution by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. stopped her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn't get out of town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hegman played Yuing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: an dishonest businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Grey), to be placed for treatment.
"I know what must be on J.R." said Hagman in 1988.
It must be said, "Here lies an honest citizen of J.R. Yuing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Príncipal, also the heroine of the original show, remembered Hagman's Friday as someone "both on and off screen."
It is memorable and irreplaceable for millions of worshipers around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who are fortunate to know and love it.
Ten episodes of a new "Dallas" were shown several months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season and the sixth in production has already been completed, reported the channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements about what will happen to the show after Hagman's departure.
Fort-wuert, Texas, was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who glistened in classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he was born in 1931 during his marriage to a lawyer, Ben Hagman.
He attempted happiness in the theater scenes of New York in the early 1950s and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, Maj Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many famous people live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Helo Darlin': Tal (and Absolutley True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't include anything that I thought could hurt someone or influence them in any way," he said to Princea Asociada at the time.
After his liver transplant, he promoted organ donation and worked as a hospital volunteer to help patients who were afraid.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery, and after," he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it'll be a little awkward for a short time, but you'll be okay."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course is beginning to explore "The End of the Light".
Every week, students are studying apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this sester, when a professor of religion, Stuart Sharme, decided to read the course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an indistinguishable lure: the end of the Maya calendar's "long reverse count," 21 December, which many people seized as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was expected of him in the next few months: a catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a financial crisis, which some call the “long-armageddon”, and a growing conflict that would involve Israel, a place where Christian theorists of the end of time believe that the Apocalypse would start.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharme this week at Rutgers-Camden University.
Looking at what is happening in the world today, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember, bad things are good for those who have an apocalyptic mental image.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the last one in history.
At the University of Templa, Associate Professor Barry Waker is reading a course on media, culture and the end of the world.
Every week, students study optical topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are spread over time," he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that cause certain actions by a human being.
If nuclear material fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analysed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
"I've tried to tell students what is probably true and impossible," said Walker.
At the University of Pennsylvania's main campus, Matthew Restall, a Latin American professor of history, and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art and anthropology, joined together to read a course called "The End of the World."
"We're not adding '2012' to always be able to read the course again, in the event that the end of the world doesn't come," said Restall.
Despite the “imminent destruction”, students must learn, prepare projects and pass final examinations.
In Penn State, the final examination will be passed on the run of the Apocalypse, which leaves no choice but to work “until the very night on which the world is expected to end”, said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"The town's over in two hours," said Restalvous about his high-middle-level student course, which was attended by 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for many weeks before the semester began, from people who asked if there were any other places.
The students, in turn, assure us that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology at Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Vekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and Nursery, said he was watching all the apocalyptic films.
"I never heard of a course to teach it," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed -- let alone a professor -- said he believed on the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and we discredited it in some way," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the last year of Templa University in West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just the key moment on the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture that has lasted several centuries, where people respond to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think of it," he said.
Mostly in an English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, which teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question as to whether he knew of any course on the “end of the world” there.
“Philippines does not participate at the end of the world”, he wrote, implying a superior order.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Retailed that many days of the last trial had been referred to for a long time and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people would immediately start thinking about the next date” or to philosophically, that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers take care of this date.
Some said they were going to the "end of the world" party.
"Maybe I'll call some friends to laugh together," commented Samir Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Communications Department.
