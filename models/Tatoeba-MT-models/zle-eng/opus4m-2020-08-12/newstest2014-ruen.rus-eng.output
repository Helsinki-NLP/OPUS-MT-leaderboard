Two men committed suicide in Kinsma and the district
Previously, one of the hangers had attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1 to 00, in the village of Lugova, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
He's known to have attempted suicide before.
What moved a man to do that is unknown.
On 31 October, at 11 to 50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, died at his place of residence.
No signs of enforced death have been found, as reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs Press Service “Kinesemi”.
You got a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair the spreading highway system, many begin to see a solution in a small black box carefully fitted on your car’s dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile of traffic and transmit this information to officials, are at the heart of the controversial attempt to modernize the obsolete system of financing American highways undertaken by Washington State and State planners.
Usually, the boring highway planning arena has given rise to intense debate and colorful alliances.
The Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to use small eggs to track the number of miles you travel and perhaps even where you travel, and then to use this information in tax accounts.
The tea-party movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
Although Congress cannot yet agree whether to continue or not, several states are not planning to wait.
They reflect on how the next decade could lead to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“This is not the question on which we can have the right of choice,” said Hassan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, who is preparing plans to begin tracking the State authorities ' miles of every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's already technology for that.
This is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Foundation for the Construction of Highways, financed by taxes paid by Americans at gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise even one cent tax at high gasoline prices.
“The tax on gasoline cannot be maintained,” said Lee Mannich, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices had recently been installed on his vehicle to test the fraudulent payment system.
“That will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
The snouts call it a wrong user's fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, since taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planning authorities in California are looking at the system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the state's ambitious laws against global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives, Bill Schuester (Republicn, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the Chamber, said that he also viewed the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market entrants in the Reason Foundation are also thrilled to have drivers pay for each mile.
“It's not just a tax that's going to go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Political Affairs, Rason.
People pay directly for what they're getting.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. Ministers of Transport who, in 2011, called on Congress to move in the direction of excision payments.
The U.S. Senate approved a 90 million-dollar pilot project last year, involving some 10,000 vehicles.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fear of rural legislators representing voters who often travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities are nevertheless on their own.
The state of Oregon shows the greatest enthusiasm, involving 5,000 drivers to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles instead of taxes on gasoline.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, it's under consideration.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with trucks.
And Coalition I-95, which includes the transport departments of 17 Eastern Coastal States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is examining how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the Government could monitor every move.
“Requirement about a big brother and similar things is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and efficiency management in the Nevada State Department of Transport.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the trials were under way, the American Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices”.
There is no need to create a huge, huge technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states that has been looking hard to find low-cost technology that would enable the state authorities to keep track of the miles of traffic, but without information about the location or time.
If you can do that, said Khan, society will feel more at ease.
This technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Milage.
Initially, the company did not cooperate in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing car insurance market, where drivers pay on the basis of the runway.
But the devices she's testing attracts road designers because they're not using GPS and they're providing a limited amount of information from time to time downloaded using the modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don't track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Milage.
There were some major errors in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do so.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with different options for drivers.
They can choose a device from or without GPS.
Or they may completely abandon the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all the citizens of the state travel.
In other places, it is hoped to sell the idea to the alert public, forcing them to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials seek to develop a tax device that will also accept payment for parking counters, provide “payments as you drive” to the insurance company, and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.
“The motorists will be involved in the benefits they will be offered,” says the urban design document.
Some transport system designers, however, are wondering whether all false pay conversations are simply a huge distraction.
In the San Francisco Bay Transport Commission, officials say that Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the trust fund for highway construction by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be taxed on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you need to do is accept aspirin, ” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their own privacy and many other things.
EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in the event of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a stand-by plan to provide Ukraine with gas as well as agreement with IMF on emergency credit should Russia take any action in response to a possible signing of an association treaty between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
A stand-by loan is under negotiation with IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential credit from IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and IMF can overcome long-standing differences in terms of financing.
The international rating agency S&P, which had reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating by one degree on Friday, to “B-” with “B”, did not believe in the reforms necessary to obtain assistance.
However, the EU representatives said that IMF could show flexibility in terms of credit, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country ' s financial support plan, the EU has a stand-by option to provide Ukraine with gas, the majority of which is now leaving Russia.
It might be the gas from the North Flow or the reverses from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way to do so if Russia “insulates” Ukraine.
Analytics believe that this method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and is likely to lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
“Each EU country and Ukrainian is negotiating how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from sources other than Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes,” added Reuters source.
Russia outside the fight against urban pollution by motor vehicles
Efforts to solve the transport problems of major cities have been made in most of the world's megacities since the second half of the twentieth century.
This was generally either a change in and expansion of the roads or an attempt to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of cars and the time they were used.
Singapore is well known for its strict quotaing of the increase in private vehicles and the right to purchase them is purchased through auctions.
Its price can be two or three times that of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced entry fees to the centre of the city.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced where only cars with a specific ecoclass that also use high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles) are allowed to enter.
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a “five-year clean air plan” in 2012 at a total cost of about 250 billion Yuan (about $40 billion).
As told by the Director of the Transport Pollution Control Division of the Municipal Environmental Protection Office of Beijing, Lee Kungseng, the main objective of the five-year-old is to reduce the lead air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, increase in the number of private vehicles up to a maximum of 6 million (currently 5.2 million) and increase by no more than 5 per cent in the use of fuel per vehicle.
According to the agency, the vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme are to restrict the use of road transport, as well as to introduce additional taxes for the owners.
Among other things, the urban “green five-year-old” measures include an accelerated transition from the rest of the country to Euro-fuel standards, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and vehicle and fuel marking, restrictions on the entry of vehicles into the centre of the city, a ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (other than the creation of incentive financial programmes to replace old vehicles with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service), and the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Road innovation in Beijing also includes the prohibition of all private vehicles from traffic within the fifth transport ring (six of them all in the PRC capital), one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle registration plate) and the issuance of registration signs for motor vehicles on a lottery basis (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for the registration of private cars in Beijing was only one third of 2010.
According to the current State programme “Environment 2012 - 2020”, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011 “moving sources” accounted for 41 per cent of all city air pollutants.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from automobiles are 10 times higher than those from industrial vehicles and in St. Petersburg they are nine times higher.
In the Russian Federation, the possibility of restrictive car regulation on the streets of cities is just beginning to reflect.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of WEC, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at reducing the demand for road travel are notoriously unpopular and can only be taken by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory effects - service and personal cars, as well as “legitimate” users, with a total number of at least 200,000 (about 5% of the total number of Moscow vehicles).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOMOG Centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study analysing the balance of urban areas between housing, road surface and road traffic.
The main findings of the researchers are: the city centre is provided with roads twice as much as required, and most of the motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them in parking lots or just in the streets.
As a result, it is proposed that vehicles be built rather than parking, instead of expanding, but that the carriageway be reduced (so that the streets become more friendly to pedestrians) and that personal transport be restricted to the historical centre ' s security area (the total area of some 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Penalties for unauthorized street trade in Vodda will increase by number
According to the city authorities, an increase in fines would help to bring order to Vaudda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street dealers do not pay taxes, the products they produce often do not have adequate sanitation control.
This means that moisture is at risk.
Thus, the lower fine for illegal trade will increase sixfold from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles from November onwards, reporting to the Voodda Administration Press Service.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of increasing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of unpaid consumer credit and massive cuts of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed but rather that of the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is entirely due to consumption, which hardly reduces turnover,” said main economist Goldman Sachs in Russia, Clemens Graffa, presenting yesterday's quarterly report on the Russian economy.
Currently, the nominal wage increase in Russia is about 10%.
With 6% inflation, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at around current levels, expected in Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to optimize staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are increasing by 10%, GDP by only 2%, Mr. Grafe explained.
Companies faced a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow up, it may result in dismissals and increased unemployment.
Russian business cannot raise wages, comments Chief Economist Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS, Vladimir Pantushin.
Unemployment near historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise their salaries in order to lure or retain their current staff.
The consumption of support in Russia is reaping and very rapid growth in the demand for credit.
According to Mr. Grafe, because of the extremely high rates of consumer loans, this type of credit does not have an impact on the economy.
"The benefits of increasing the demand for credit are not seen, the money is not divided by the economy, but are returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments," said the economist.
But the other problem is that Goldman Sachs is expecting an increase in the delay on unfunded loans.
They are mainly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide for them.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more frequently," Mr. Grafe noted.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the Russian economy is a possible crisis of unpaid loans.
The Director of the WSEC Banking Institute, Vasily Sladkov, is already seeing signs of an upcoming banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to public banks, were forced to raise public funds at high interest rates.
In response, the State's banks have set out on the path of war and have begun to lower their credit rates, and the economist continues.
Small lending organizations may not issue loans at the same interest rate, or they will have negative interest margins.
If the state banks don't give up the dumping, the Russian Federation is threatened with a full-fledged banking crisis, she says.
Exemption of licences from a number of banks in recent weeks is considered by economists to be the harbinger of mass collapse.
“The state's own situation will not work: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis”, warns the head of the institution.
But the increase in consumption will slow down and without a crisis of non-payments, believed in an investment bank, owing to the non-indexation of public and military salaries in the current version of the budget.
In part, the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a consequence, by the reduction of inflation).
But only partially: if investment does not grow (and the prerequisites are not yet - see the certificate), consumption will slow down anyway, confident in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still the drop in the price of oil," he said.
He estimated that Russia's economy would start to decline at a cost of less than $90/barr.
In Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradox: inflation has declined and banks have begun to raise interest rates.
This could mean they didn't believe the CB, which announced the transition to inflation,” said Clemens Grafe.
The central bank's interest policy does not affect market rates; it only affects interbank credit rates.
"To the CB it's a failure of all hopes," said Clemens Grafe.
The money obtained at the CB auctions is used by banks to manage their liquidity rather than to lend money to the economy
Once the rate drops, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to get into speculation against the ruble.
“Early or later, the CB will realize that this strategy is not working”, said Mr. Grafe, and recalled that the State is planning to put the ruble into “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But either you have to do it earlier or you have to raise the key rate of the CB (5.5 per cent), he thinks.
According to him, the ruble is now artificially overstated by 10%.
I'm only driving one road - weak, and the expert concludes.
But if the CB puts a shadow of doubt in the financiers that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the ruble, it can break the ruble much more.
The second South Ural Assembly was held in Chelabinsk.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The Congress was attended by delegations from all cities and regions of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious faiths, legislative and executive bodies, with a total of about 350 persons.
The course is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions but also for other countries.
We have no differences and no differences.
We're living in complete understanding," Féofan, mitropolitan of Chelabinski and Zlatostoustoski.
A number of issues were addressed during the meeting, including the education of patrioticism and cultural cooperation.
Following the Congress, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
An exhibition of national cultural associations in Chelyabin Province was opened.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden, U.S. intelligence detector, said that he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to answer questions about his activities.
German deputy Hans-Cristian Strebele met on Thursday with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, who was presented by a deputy to the media in Berlin on Friday, stated: “Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to view dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements by unprotected criminal charges.”
Speaking the truth, however, is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to renounce criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense after allegations were made that NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads a parliamentary group in charge of intelligence, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without endangering him or breaking his relationship with the United States completely”, it should be used.
Mr. Streöbele, a member of Parliament from the Green German Party, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strabele said that, according to counsel for former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia had he left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would have needed assurances that he would be there “safe”, the deputy said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his home.
He said, however, that he was encouraged by the world's response to “his political remarks”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level officials — including in the United States — saw the exposing of an uncontrolled system of all-encompassing surveillance as useful for society.
The letter proposes to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge manual storage fees
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for putting their hands on board their flight.
Frantier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand-cooking and $2 for coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers would be able to keep the entire bank.
The new manual deposit fee applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frantier said he would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100, if the travellers paid only when they were at the landing.
Frantier's representative Kate O'Malley said that $100 fees should make passengers take care of payment in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for this,” she said.
The airlines began charging the first and second bags in luggage in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these charges gain as much as they can in a hand-cuffed luggage compartments, which often means that they lack space in these compartments.
The fees are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really about making money.
The thing is, the most loyal of Frantier clients say finding a place in the upper baggage compartments is getting harder.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the Frontier flight may be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change in procedures on the website and at Frontier's registration points is intended to ensure that passengers will know what to do before they land.
The new Frontier Manual Cadastre collection will not begin until summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that baggage processing costs money, and the passengers who need this service have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover air travel costs after years of loss.
Most of them, however, did not have to do with manual storage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual fee three years ago, and another discotheque Allegyant Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with this charge is Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
According to his December 2011 report, the manual deposit fee brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, the former top manager of Midwest Airlines, had recently flown across the Spirit flight, and he wondered what he would find at the exit of the landing when the passengers encountered an unusual spirit fee for hand-cuffing.
“The landing process was the smoothest thing I've seen for my career in airlines,” he said.
I was expecting to see a brush of teeth and a fight at the exit.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing was fast."
Frontier also follows Spirit for $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frantier stated that passengers who receive gas or juice could keep the entire bank and that the coffee rains would be provided free of charge.
It will continue to provide free water.
US Airways tried to charge for drinks for a short time in 2008, but refused seven months after passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed her example.
Frontier's manual fee initiative, where passengers don't buy tickets directly from the airline, is its latest effort to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay tickets to online salesmen like Orbitz, from $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than to go to a tourism online agency.
But Frontier went beyond everyone else in this field.
In September, she started to give twice as much bonus miles of frequent flyers to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the peak number of miles to 25 per cent of the mile of travel.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from the Fronttier, purchased from an online travel agency, would provide 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose a place in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frantier has a loyal client base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is getting smaller and lost.
The revenue decreased by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published by Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republic is trying to correct the Frontier finance as part of the airline sale.
NSA blames "internal error", not hackers, to shut down the site
The undercovered National Security Agency announced on Friday evening that their website had been closed for several hours, causing a technical malfunction, not hackers, as claimed on the network.
“NSA.gov was inaccessible within hours this evening because of the internal error that occurred during the planned renewal”, reported the intelligence agency in an official electronic letter.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The claim that the disruption was caused by a distributed “service denial” attack [DDoS] is incorrect.
Earlier this evening, server online monitoring systems recorded that the NSA site had not been operational for at least six hours and the site was still not accessible to some users.
Previously, the NSA representative had reported to ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency had been hacked into.
No classified information was in danger, the representative reported.
At least one online activist hacker group claimed to be responsible for the NSA site crashing through DDoS attacks.
DDoS attacks are designed to ensnare the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is broken.
Hacker tactics are relatively simple and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of target systems.
Previously, the supersecret NSA, once nicknamed “No such Agency”, has been at the centre of public attention and fierce criticism in recent months following a series of revelations of its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and internally — all of which are reactions to the NSA ' s secret files stolen from the agency and published by the disillusioned former NSA official Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency has led to the suspicion that today ' s incident was the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier's profits are declining with the decline in supply and number of aircraft orders
The Beaubardier Corporation, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported on Thursday a 15 per cent reduction in net profits due to a decrease in the number of orders and supplies of fixed-wing aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
The Beaubardier, located in Montreal, has also not published any data on the flight tests of its latest CSeries aircraft, nor has it provided new information on whether ambitious plans to commercialize the aircraft will be implemented by next September.
After the first flight of the pilot aircraft, which took place about one and a half months ago, it only flew three more times, raising questions as to whether the test phase was on schedule.
The results failed to meet the expectations and resulted in a decline of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from “higher than average” to “medium” because of the belief that the growth of shares was limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in the number of airlifts was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed at the return of the Transport Division,” said Doerksen in the stock market review.
We believe that Boumbardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the summer test program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more sceptical of the programme.
Homebardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominant.
The first test sample of the aircraft was presented in March and made its first flight in September after months of delay.
However, the firm CSeries orders are not so much as 177 so far, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to verify the company's allegations of fuel efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director, Pierre Boduan, was confident that Boumbardier would reach its target of 300 fixed orders by the time the first aircraft was put in business.
On Thursday, leaders also assured analysts and media that the programme was moving forward according to plan.
“The test model of the aircraft was not longer than expected on the ground,” said Bodouan during the telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software upgrades were planned during the aircraft’s idle.
All manufacturers plan different tests.
We decided to take our first flight and take a break for renewal, and that's what we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight testing programme.
The second of the five test samples is scheduled to take place in the coming weeks and all others will soon follow him, as reported by the company.
Still, analysts are skeptical about the claim that the first client would be able to operate the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Boumbardier stated that it would assess the lead time and provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow rate of flight testing - although apparently consistent with the internal Bombardier schedule - reinforces our view that the entry into service will be carried over to the first quarter of 2015,” said Dorksen.
In the third quarter, ending on 30 September, Boumbardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted equity gains remained the same — 9 cents.
Gross income fell slightly - from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analytics expected 10 cents per share and gross income $4.5.6 billion, according to Thomason Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that he had delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, which was lower than the previous year's figure of 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 fixed-wing aircraft.
The space office's portfolio amounted to $32.9 billion as at 30 September, without changing since 31 December.
“In the aerospace region, results were consistent with our objectives, but the low number of orders received and the overall market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” said Bodouan.
Gross income for the space field fell by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Boumbardier, the world's largest train producer, reported that the gross income in this sector had increased by nearly 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The order portfolio in the transport unit was $32.6 billion by 30 September, slightly higher than the figure of 31 December.
The transport unit ' s incomes were adversely affected by the implementation of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced that the top financial director of Google, Patrick Pichett, would join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent, to $4.83 in the tendering process in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world ' s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and nearest bombardier competitor, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony's counting on lower annual profit.
The Japanese electronics producer Sony, having completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony ' s results during the period from July to September 2013 were more discouraging than expected due to the fall in demand for televisions, cameras and personal computers of Japanese corporation production.
Sony's television business in the second quarter of the company's first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years fell again to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through difficult times, especially as the demand for television decreases.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the customer segment.
For example, one of Sony's major rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its emphasis on industrial components: sales of the company are growing at a high rate, especially through automobile systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to make 179 billion yen of operating profits against the expected previous 230 billion yen.
According to Thomason Reuters, however, analysts were expected to be much higher and to be 221 billion yen.
In an effort to cope with the crisis, Sony expands the food line.
In the middle of this month, it was announced that the sale of smart hours would be launched by a Japanese corporation with a number of fashionable functions that would eliminate the need for 100 times a day to take out of a smartphone pocket.
After Sony reduced the annual profit and revenue forecast, the company's shares at the opening of the Tortories in Tokyo lost more than 11 per cent in the morning, falling to 1,668 yen per share.
The speech gene turned out to be a synapse.
Scientists at Johns Hawkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered a protein that makes Foxp2 the ‘gen of speech’ their function by stimulating new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and a summary is available on the magazine’s website.
The gene Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 through the identification of several family members who were unable to speak correctly and who sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists have found that family members have lost their Foxp2 gene, but how it fulfils its function remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their functions, Foxp2 is a simulator for new synapses in the brain's speech-related field.
He's doing this thanks to another gene, SSRPX2.
The latter was discovered by identifying factors that encourage synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by the authors, with Foxp2 visible solely on its activities.
What SSRPX2 really does affect cocalculation, scientists have confirmed in the muscle experiment.
When animals had artificially reduced their gene activity, they were less likely to scream when separated from their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the sound produced was restored.
In the past, mice also showed a connection to the co-calculation of Foxp2 itself.
The animals, who were given a human copy of the gene, were fed more actively and at a lower frequency than regular mice.
So far, however, scientists are not aware of whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, its SSRPX2 is linked to purely “mechanical” properties of sound or finer processes.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the leader of a criminal group about a police investigation was imprisoned
A 42-year-old, Basharat Ditta, transmitted information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough
Counsel was afraid that his clandestine drug addiction would be solved
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
The honorary lawyer who told the drug baron about the major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditta transmitted secret information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough on his investigation of drug trafficking activities after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer who received the nickname Bash and who was called a “cool lawyer” among the perpetrators was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation for Scarborough, which he had previously represented in a drug court.
Officers observed that the 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn County of Lancashire while he was at a bar association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Dietta was “regularly using” a class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet, and his credit cards.
During the eight-month period from January to August 2011, he tried illegally to obtain information on the arrest of two persons on the orders of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time, as part of a major investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashira, Cambodia, Merciside, Burkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police had seized heroin and cocaine in a series of raids, worth `1.5 million, and more than 200,000 in cash.
A 42-year-old, Dietta, transmitted information to the criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditt, which works for Forbes Politicals, located in Blackburn, it was disgraced when he was found guilty of two cases of deliberate interference with the trial following a three-week trial in the Liverpool Court of the Crown.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at a previous court hearing.
A lawyer was revealed after the police investigating Scarborough had discovered that he had regularly spoken to Diett by telephone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and discovered how he went to Diett's house in Blackburn and placed 60 percent purity drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer's garbage box.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough was repeatedly convened by Diett, who was at the Ywood Park football stadium of Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs, and nine conversations were held between them.
The court learned that Dietta “regularly used” cocaine after tests had found class A drug traces in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.
Dietta was later arrested but denied cocaine use, said he had spoken to the suspect dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their association was “Avocat's secret”.
During his detention, Diett took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
While questioning the police, he said that, along with his workplace, he had both a home office and clients came to his home in legal cases.
However, the court learned that, after important arrests, he had called the largest participants in drug trafficking, a number of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell them what the detectives knew about.
In an indictment, Ann White said: “If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, it is a lawyer in criminal matters.”
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer, as he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer; it's a drug dealer who provides drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly be legitimate, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has greatly exceeded the limits of the normal relationship between counsel and client.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible to allow these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not respect his profession, but disgraced it.
He had come too close to certain customers, such as Scarborough, and had allowed himself to be questioned about his lack of interest.
Ditt did not confess guilt and stated: “If I had been a corrupt lawyer to whom I am not, and would like to convey information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Holstead of the Lancashira Police stated: “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as he starts buying drugs from organized crime”.
His cocaine addiction has made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of major criminal groups, which have instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire public confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Diett ' s investigation was led by the Lancashire Specially Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which has already been sentenced to three cocaine storage cases and now to obstruct justice by demonstrating our desire to achieve fair punishment for the perpetrators.
Let the case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was convicted for 14 years after guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 persons who participated in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related offences.
On his web site, Ditta organized a question - and - answer discussion, in which he said that his dream was a lawyer representing his clients with the death penalty in America, his ideal companion for dinner was Mohammed Ali, and his motivation for work was inequality.
The Yaroslavla stadium is not ready for 22,000 visitors, and police officers who were present at the meeting of the FRFK today have noted.
The flight program was, in their opinion, about twice as high.
During the match of 1/16 the final Russian Cup with Spartacus was used by only a thousand stewards with a standard of 9,000.
Spartak fans had 2,200 seats, or 10 per cent of the stadium’s capacity, but by agreement with the Moscow Club, they had sold 5,000 tickets.
This information was read by the head of the KDC, Arthur Gregoryyantz.
Americans were listening to Japanese high officials
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the U.S. intelligence service who had chosen not to disclose his name said that the States had listened to the telephone calls of high-ranking officials in Japan.
The man confirmed that there were several places for listening in the land of the rising sun.
He noted, however, that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not engage in intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with Americans in the post-war period, are objects for exploration activities, according to NHK.
This information has not yet been formally commented on by either party.
Remember, the news about U.S. special forces surveillance at the FAR chancellor came out last week.
According to German journalists, NSA was able to listen to Merkel's phone over the last 10 years.
The chancellor himself, according to some reports, received the news of his wiretap very painfully.
She stated that the allies she considered to be the FAR and the US for decades, such monitoring of the head of Government, was unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden stated that he was ready to share details of the wiretapping of Angela Merkel's conversations with the German prosecutor's office.
The German specifically came to Moscow to meet a former CIA officer.
Bashary may tender grain not before the beginning of 2014
The Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic, Nicolai Kovalenko, can tender grain during State procurement interventions at the earliest possible date in 2014.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sale to the intervention fund.
So far, the price on the market is higher, and there's demand.
"Maybe the grain will be traded after New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that this year ' s crop crop cultivation in 2013 was 3.1 million hectares, including the area of cereals 1.7 million ha, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the last year.
In 2014, 550,000 ha was sown (an increase of 105,000 hectares compared with 2012).
The area under winter wheat and tritica has been increased, and the birth has remained at the same level.
There is no Brate Circle group at the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, to which Leps was assigned in the United States
In the databases of the Russian forces of the Brate Circle group, which Washington has added to the singer Gregory Leps, this is not the case.
As noted by Interfax in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after all the databases were reported by the U.S. Department of Finance, Gregory Leps, to the control lists on suspicion of being a member of the Eurasian criminal Syndicate of the “Brat Circle”, all the databases were checked but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian Mafia”, which is allegedly operating abroad, is considered to be in the force structure.
"Even in the very name--' The fraternal circle ', there's some element of mystery, containing hints upon the secret bed.
"It's all very similar to a play event," said the agency interviewer.
On 31 October, the U.S. Department of Finance announced that Arthur Badalian, Gregory Lepsveridze, Wadim Lälin, Sergey Moscalenko, Jacob Ribalski and Igor Shlkov had been placed on its control lists on suspicions of being a member of the Eurasian criminal Syndicate.
The listed individuals are suspected of having links with some of Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who have been considered to be influential members of criminal groups and who have been on U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Gregory Leps is “a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev”.
At the producer centre of Gregory Lepps, they refused to comment on the U.S. allegations against the singer, calling them a "roar."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama classified the “Brat circle” as a “significant transnational organized criminal group” and commissioned the minfin to “invent and prohibit their global criminal operations”.
The blacklisting of a person in the United States of America ' s mine has resulted in the freezing of his assets in the United States and the ban on business contacts with him by persons residing in the United States.
Scandal video hit the police.
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and blatantly reckless activities, got caught smoking cracks.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had a video record and were ready to initiate an investigation against the granary.
He stated that he would not leave his post, reports CNN.
The information that authorities had evidence of Rob Ford's use of drugs appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of local law enforcement agencies, Bill Blair, held a press conference.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share these personnel with the public, but for their existence he was given the power to do so.
According to Blair, Robert Ford's compromise video was detected during an anti-drug raid conducted by guards around the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had previously reported the existence of this video, but until recently there had been no evidence.
The mayor does not comment on this matter.
He just says it's not his fault and he's not going to retire.
The video recorded by the police is one of the evidences in the case of Ford Alexander Lisi, a 35-year-old friend, accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal income and criminal conspiracy.
At times, Lysie was the driver of Rob Ford.
The city has long demanded the resignation of its mayor.
He repeatedly fought journalists, appeared in a drunken manner and allowed racist and sexist speech.
Asmann Bereten + Planen, the German company Asmann Beratn + Planen, was recognized as the winner of the design projector's choice.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the UAO press service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and under the terms of the tender, the project was to be prepared and sent to State experts in the spring of 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal as well as infrastructure facilities, inland roads and airport improvement elements.
In the first phase of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50,000 square metres, and it may be further increased.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the design documents will take into account the prospects for the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to service some 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
By the time the outcome of the tender was completed, the architectural concept of the South Aeronautics complex had been developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The design of the main terminal project reflects the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-na-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Bereten + Planen has experience in major projects, the company has designed terminals C and E “Sheremitevievo International Airport” and a new aeronautic complex at Knevici International Airport in Vladivostok.
The international airport complex “South” will be built in the Aksai district of Rostow region and will replace the current growth airport, which will be closed and will be integrated into the urban building in the future.
The start of the construction of the aero-occular complex is scheduled for 2014 and the introduction of all facilities is scheduled for 2017.
A politician in Turkey declared a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities started construction of the separation wall in the area of Nusaibin in south-east Turkey.
The local residents and representatives of the PMD pro-Curd party strongly opposed construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin Aisha Gekhan border with Syria announced a hunger strike protesting against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, and informed RIA News in the Press Service of the Party for Peace and Democracy (PSD) on Friday.
The police have repeated protests.
The Head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muammer Güller, first rebutted the construction and then stated that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"The Mayor of Nusaibin Aisha Gekhan, a member of the GPA, announced a hunger strike, thereby turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," stated the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from each other and that the Kurds crossed the border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhuman situation with which the Kurds will never agree,” quoted Aisha Hackhan as party representatives.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is scheduled to take place on 7 November in Nusaibin.
Venezuela will establish an exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the bolivar, vis-à-vis the tourist dollar.
This was reported on 1 November by the Bloomberg Agency with reference to the Government Decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand U.S. dollars a year.
Venezuela would also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the country ' s bolivars acquired at the time of departure.
A specific exchange rate against the dollar will be established at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency up to 6.3 bolivar per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost nearly 70 per cent of its value.
In September, Venezuela ' s inflation was nearly 50 per cent.
The Minister of Oil and Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, stated on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to the informal information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the exchange rate of the national currency following the municipal elections in December.
The policy of restraining the prices of products and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has resulted in a number of shortages of goods and the functioning of the black exchange market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Andrey Belmach, director of the South, noted that it was difficult to say how long it would take to find a new lead coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation was only a few hours ago, so to tell you how long it will take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, I'm not ready, IART-TAS says Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all possible options.
The priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I don't want to just find a coach, I want someone who's going to work at our club for a few years and get some results.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask: What could prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?”, the paper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This is a very harsh and punitive law, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, director of Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of the most respected independent radio stations in Kenya and a news site.
He said that the new media judiciary “will always be biased, as it is a continuation of the Government”, and restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to his deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially enable the Government to “take the media dead by grabbing” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had “suffered a serious blow” and criticized the bill as “draconomy”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Kenyan media provoked the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras where troops who had been sent to the site were allegedly robbing an expensive shopping centre.
The response of the Chief of Police, David Kimayo, was to summon two journalists and an official of the media for questioning, although the call was cancelled following mass media protests.
Under the new law, publications could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists could be fined up to one million, with an additional risk of being “out-of-listed”, i.e. prohibited from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender ' s property if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily National, “even one fine is enough to paralyse most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that those measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called rejuvenated blogosphere of Kenya.
Politicians realize that if they silence the media, they will be able to do whatever they want to do with impunity.
“No one will ever know”, wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of restraint and balance in public life.
“Policies of themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenya’s legislators have been targets of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of lifting the cuts imposed by the National Wages Commission and restoring their huge salary, which is about 53,000 shillings per month, which are not taxed, one of the highest in the world.
A new line of expenditure - the contribution for the major maintenance of the house - will be added to the city ' s communal payments.
The best estimate for the standard two-room apartment would be 100 to 400 roubles per month from the new year.
A specific standard will determine the Government of the region.
But when you paint the entrance, order the stairs, or even replace the elevator, it's up to the tenants to decide.
This law was approved by members of the Regional Duma.
Vladimir K keynikov, chairman of the Voronez Regional Duma, observed: “In this case too, it is necessary to prioritize houses, to accumulate funds not in the management companies – which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, and somewhere else, it will be State control over the spending of funds collected by residents for the renovation of apartment houses”.
Under the control of the State, there is now a lot of construction.
The law protecting fraudsters has been approved by slander in the final reading.
The document was not born empty.
In our region, 4,500 people have been affected by dishonest developers.
The problems of the majority have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and responsibilities for all participants in the building.
Vladimir Keynikov, chairman of the Voronze Regional Duma, said: "It's no secret that there's also started abuses in this area due to the fact that in the year 98 the same rangers were caught, and in the 2000s the same rangers."
People started making money to cover the loophole, including the two laws.
Under Voronage, it was decided to build a temporary stay centre for foreign nationals to be deported.
The District Parliament has enacted such a law not only under pressure from the federation.
The problems of irregular migrants in the region are at least exonerated.
In the past year, for example, just over 100,000 foreigners have been registered.
But only 1 in 5 has formalized a work permit.
Where everyone else works and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Keynikov, president of the Voronez Regional Duma, said, "They've violated the law, but they're not criminals."
There's no court and you have to deport them - they have to be held somewhere.
The Federation has decided that regional means will provide such places.
In the Voronez region, this is the Old Olshanka of the Similuk region.
In the end, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to many children.
First, families with 5 or more children are exempt from transport taxes.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million, but so do many parents.
Secondly, and most importantly, those who adopt three and younger children will receive housing subsidies from the new year.
For every member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres at 30,000 meters.
The family, for example, out of six people - the father, the mother, the mother and the 3rd - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State acquires a housing area of 108 square metres for 3 million 300,000 roubles.
For the left bank or the south-west neighbourhood, a suitable option is acceptable.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the Paradise Center for that amount.
Baumgertner nominated to the board of directors of Uralkalia.
The current Board of Directors of OAO, Uralalili, has nominated the commander Vladislav Baumgertner, arrested in Minsk, to serve on the Russian company's website.
Baumgertner has been on the list of 11 persons nominated to the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, which will identify a new board of directors by vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
Upon his arrest in August of this year, he was charged with abuse of authority.
However, President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus later stated at a press conference that the charges against Baumgertner had been relegated to “theft”.
Matt Dalton's "Nephthechemic" barber refused to comment on Vladimir Crickunov's departure from his post as mentor of the lower-cams.
Holkiper believes that the acting Chief Coach, Dimitri Balmine, has great authority from the players and will handle his responsibilities.
Remember, Naphthechemic retired Crickunov today.
To be honest, I wouldn't like to comment on Vladimir Crikunov's dismissal, quoted Dalton RIA as "News."
I can only say that Dimitri Balmine will handle his obligations -- I have no doubt about that.
He has great authority on his team, and this young professional is definitely looking forward to a great future.
Leonardo Bonuchi's "Juventus" defender will not help the team at the nearest Italian championship match with Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coach staff decided not to include him in the application for the game to save him from the 4th round of the Group Round of the League of Champions with the Real.
Neither will Lichtsteiner, Vučić and Pepe join the Parma.
And Fabio Cwalarella's Forard recovered from the trauma and was ready to play.
The fuel travel will be accompanied by a tax policy, which includes an increase in the mining tax (GNI) on oil, coupled with a reduction in export duties and an increase in excise.
In the opinion of the experts, these measures could add 619.3 billion roubles to the budget.
The President of the Krasnoyar Court stole the certificate by hitting it on the head.
The unknown attacked the President of the Krasnoyar Regional Court, Vladimir Bivekonko, stealing his certificate.
Interfax reports that later on Wednesday night, the attackers hit the judge in the head, causing him to lose consciousness.
When the 63-year-old president of the court came to his senses, he found that he had been issued with an official certificate.
The money and other values the criminals did not take.
The two - year - old came to the house on his own, and the police did not return until the next day.
An investigation into the crime and the search for the perpetrators is under way.
The Zenita fans on the club's website officially recognized the ex-captain of Russia as the best player in the past month.
In October, Archaewin participated in two games of the Group Segment of the UEFA Championships League, three meetings of the Russian Championship, and in the Cup Match.
He's got two successful transmissions.
The second hit was Yuri Lodgin, who became the best player on August and September.
The third position is assailant Hulk.
The Brazilian's account has two goals and three results.
Remember, Arshavin's back at Zenit this summer.

U.S. Secretary of State: The intelligence services sometimes “went too far” in data collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that the U.S. intelligence services sometimes “went too far” when collecting data and wires, yet the politician noted that 70 million people had been caught in the media.
I assure you that innocent people have not suffered in this process, but the attempt to collect information has been unsuccessful.
Yes, in some cases this went too far and was illegal.
I recognize this, as the President also admits... and we will ensure that it doesn't happen in the future," quotes AFP Secretary of State.
Italian workers with seniority give way to young people
Italian unemployment is breaking record.
The figures published on Wednesday show that 12.5 per cent of the population is now unemployed.
Such bad things have not stood up since the Second World War.
This figure is several times higher among young people.
40.4 per cent of the population aged 15-24 years do not have employment.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one solution is early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment was already being carried out by the largest energy company in the country, and the laws adopted enabled the regional authorities to provide some early retirement pensions for employees with seniority.
On the other hand, Italy is looking forward to Europe ' s common problem of ageing populations.
And economists are not sure that the premature rotation of staff will justify itself.
What the construction of TNCs in Moscow will lead to
Each year, the capital authorities are promising to establish more and more transport and transfer units (TTRs).
It is planned to install 255 TNCs by 2020.
The project was handled by our correspondent.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence was set up at the Arbatsk-Master subway.
The note said the transport and relocation unit was in the process of being built.
This was very strange, since no land transport is stopped near “Smolenski” and therefore cannot be moved.
To reach the nearest Trolleybus stop at the Garden Ring, it is necessary to travel some 130 metres, including a land crossing through the Carmanica alley.
It's almost over at Smolensk.
A flowering laurel had disappeared, a newspaper stand had been dismantled, and asphalt had been replaced by a bar at the entrance.
There's the whole transport unit.
Transport and transplant units are flat and large, as explained in the press service of the Capital Transport Department.
Capital TNCs are not yet available.
The flattery is designed to build parking spaces, to withdraw commercial facilities that prevent the movement of passengers, to create small architectural formations and improvements.
In fact, flat TNCs are not even occupied by transporters, but by professional developers from the Moscow City Capital Repair Department.
The transport unit is not necessarily a complex structure, explains Michael Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes the roofs above the head and the signs of the time of arrival are sufficient.
For example, the Yasenevo subway recently opened a fully-fledged flat transplant unit.
Let's not wear a sticker, but with intercepting parking lots and signs indicating when the bus comes.
But in pursuit of the number, officials record anything they get.
As early as 2011, the mayor planned to build all 151 knots, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now there are 255 TPKs in plans until 2020.
Of these, one and a half are promised this year.
Although there is a programme for the development of TNCs in the city, there are no qualitative criteria, notes Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization Cities and Transport.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transplants is often deteriorating for each of them.
The criteria, in the expert ' s view, should be two: first, reduction of transplant time; and second, convenience.
First of all, it's an opportunity to change the mode of transport without raining.
In Moscow, the opposite is sometimes true when TNCs are set up.
A great example of the DDH subway.
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslav highway came to the square before the main entrance to the VIC.
Now their stops were moved to the other side of Yaroslavka to the streets of the Kosmonauts.
Far from the subway, far away from the monoreil, but closer to the homes.
For free of charge, the residents did not want a car station under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
The capital TNCs in Moscow didn't happen at once.
The first of them started building five years ago at the Planner subway.
The project was intended to become a model.
Indeed, there is a pattern of how the transplant unit paid off to investors becomes a banal trading centre.
No, there's some perches for buses, there's an overhang to stay away from the subway in the rain, and there's three floors of parking lots.
True, the Chinese Trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TNC have not been given a place in principle.
They were taken away from the subway as strangers.
But there's more room for trade.
It's just the clothes of 32 shops, and there's almost everything from the zoo to the car.
Well, what if one of the passengers had to buy a new car on the road?
We always have a shopping center when we build a capital TNC.
The situation had recently reached its logical conclusion when part of the parking lot had decided to enter the market.
Now, on the third floor of Planerna TNC, fighting is taking place among the floored parking areas.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech, and guards who look angrily at our photographer.
The transplant unit finally became a market.
The thing is, the Underground Planner's had a market before, but it was destroyed.
And in the prefecture, the merchants were spared and sent to the interception parking lot.
Because of high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was destroyed to build a new flat TNC in its place.
That's how it goes.
At the Kalulu Metro, the distance from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 meters, ” explains Alexander Morozov.
Following the construction of the shopping center, the distance was said to have increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to get through the whole mall.
After 22 hours when it's closed, we have to go through it under the open sky.
However, the design on the Planner and the Kalaluska will soon appear as flowers.
In mid-September, the City and Land Commission of the Mayor ' s Office approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TNCs.
Four of them will be 25-deck, excluding two or three underground layers.
The main monster will grow from the Tushino subway, and it will have 418.7 thousand square metres of space.
RWC railway station managers responsible for the construction of TNCs in the subway have already told journalists that stores, hotels and apartments will break up in future multi-stores.
Officials, however, believe that multi-layer parking will take between one third and half of the area.
Take, for example, "people's" garages.
Let's say that the garage is 258 cars recently built on the International Street, with an area of 8,015 square metres.
So it's going to take about 80,000 "squares" to park 2,600 cars from Petrovsko-Ruzomska.
That's less than a third of what's going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go to all kinds of permonies for buses.
There are at least 150,000 square metres of commercial real estate left.
And this, for a minute, is almost two GUMs.
If the main TNCs at stations and stations are built by railways, the rest will be developed by the Metropolitanians.
They also promised that there would be many “functional facilities”, including hotels, offices and even gymnasiums.
In fact, in the Moscow City Property Department, journalists were recently told that they were preparing a draft regulation that allowed investors to apply for a TNC site to officials directly.
No competitions.
Because I prayed that transportation was a priority for the city.
The perfect TNC is, for example, Garvard in Boston or Sudaina in Toronto, and Alexander Morozov is certain.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend to the ground at the metro level, and the distance from the subway train to the tram is only 50 metres without entering the street.
There's no more trade around.
But Moscow officials are being thrown to the extremes.
Either we're not gonna build anything or we're gonna blow off 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to treat extremism as an insult to patriotic feelings
In order to provide legislative protection to citizens against provocations and insults directed against Russia, “Righteous Russia” proposes to equate the insults to extremist activities and to punish them for five years in prison.
As reported in the newspaper Izvedia, such legislative amendments, prepared by the Pre-Duma Committee on Energy, Oleg Mikheev, are already being sent to the Supreme Court and the Government to obtain an opinion.
By the patriotic feelings of the citizens, the author of the amendments proposes an understanding of the emotional relationship of the individual to the country of which he is a national, characterized by the love of the country, the responsible attitude towards its destiny, and respect for its history and culture.
According to Mikheev, domestic law sanctions exist for abuse of the official signs of State authority - the flag and the pistol.
In the view of the parliamentarian, however, the protection of Russians whose feelings could be assimilated and insultd by State symbols and other expressions of disrespect for our country is not sufficiently worked out in Russian law.
He cites as an example the discussions that unfold every year on the eve of the Day of Victory, when some media figures allow themselves to question the heroic victory of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main popular holiday, the Victory Day of 9 May, a real vaccicle is launched every year.
By learning to be acute and “alternative” to history, some publicists have come to the conclusion that, unfortunately, the cultural Germans have not won the wild Soviet Union!
I think it's absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main “spiritual strength” of the nation, and Oleg Micaev is outraged.
Moreover, according to Mikheev, there are many more patriotic people in Russia than there are religious ones, but the law is punishable for offending the faith, and it can be almost with impunity.
According to the popular electorate, it is necessary to equate the insults of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to prescribe penalties in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for a penalty for offending patriotic feelings, ranging from a fine of 100 thousand to 5 years ' imprisonment.
The magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the area of the city of Cokimbo in central Chile, and is transmitted by Reuters.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometres and over a distance of 54 kilometres south-west of the city, as detailed on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) website.
The pushers were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on 1 November on Moscow).
There has been no report of the victims or of the damage caused by underground attacks.
We will recall that Chile is in one of the most earthquake - active areas of the earth, so earthquakes of different forces are not rare.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
Then the magnitude of the 8.8 earthquake and its tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: 9.5 in 1960.
More than 5,000 people were killed in the disaster.
Dimitri Medvedev: The Greenpeace case will be dealt with fairly
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dimitri Medvedev, reported on Friday that Greenpeace activists' case would be dealt with in strict conformity with Russian law.
France can be confident that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
“We can guarantee compliance with the laws,” said Dmitry Medvedev in a meeting with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detainees, Greenpeace is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, like other activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," Mr. Ero's RIA News.
“Our country cannot support activities that may harm the environment, nor can anyone violate the law,” said Dimitri Medvedev.
He said that any structure that attempted to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, was dangerous.
He pointed out that these objects were “as powder barrels” and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, and transmitted “RIA News”.
The United Nations proclaims new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations should start work immediately on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which had been formulated 12 years earlier to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, prior to the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, beginning in Rio de Janeiro on the eve of the evening.
They were included in the outcome document signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit the night before that it was time to “stand above national interests”.
“I am pleased that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and control the process of establishing universal sustainable development goals — CSD”, he said.
These CSDs will build on our progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will spare no effort to take advantage of the authority vested in me by member countries to translate our vision of sustainable development, which is based on the successful achievement of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the top of the statue of Zamora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to scan slogans about peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Cousus, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she replaced the business suit with a T-shirt decorated with “We Demand Security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Metropolitan Square of Independence.
Almost every two weeks, there were reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the most violent clashes since the Armistice was held more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a prominent rebel movement supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa of the apartheid era, as part of the efforts to destabilize the country ' s independent Government.
After the Armistice of 1992, it became an opposition party.
While analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to a full-scale conflict, recent events have caused foreign investors and local residents to become nervous.
The rates are high for a rapidly growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas shelf and coal fields in the north-west may attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Valle of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, which has been leading the political force since 1975, and the Renamo party have accused each other of creating tensions.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government was the instigator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional seal of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels were then intensified when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlacama, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armandu Gebuza tried to dispel fears about instability.
Hebusa told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a "lostman" who wanted to use “all that he had left to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns have increased following the report that Mazanga had declared renegotiation of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the Frelimo Party Agreement.
“Our aim is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness,” said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tension that this year ' s series of clashes has intensified.
“ These are two powerful men (Gebuza and Dhlakama) who have faced their foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them are a good negotiator and none of them are prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which was trying to achieve electoral reforms, had already announced that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by a weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The vote for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which is based on former Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in those elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was expected to resign next year, when his second term ended, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want multiparty democracy; he doesn't want transparent elections; he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency,” said Mazanga.
It is not clear what it can do, but it has already launched destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beyru, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Valle, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when he was asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo party wanted to “warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique”, said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the Government's frustration, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacop.
“People think that the Government and the President are responsible for the future of the country, who must find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuan, a member of the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace to resume, they want free access to roads,” he said.
The "Art Master" series will be held in Moscow
The "Art Master" series, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they are released, will take place at the "Rolan" cinema from 1 to 5 November, and report to RIA "News" with reference to the project organizers.
He'll open the "Art Master" program of the French director's comedy and actress Reim Kerichi's "Paris at any price".
This is a story of the Maye (Sam Kerichi) model, which is being deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, the audience will also see a new picture of the famous South Korean film director Kim Ki Duques “Mebius”, a melodramatic bike by Oliver Hirsbigel “Diana: A History of Love” (Diana), with Naomi Watts as the main feature and main film of the May Cannes Film Festival, “Living Adele” Abdeltif Keshish.
The only Russian participant in Art Meinstrema will be the winner of the film by Alexander Weldinsky's "Geographer Golobus Propsil" on the basis of Alexei Ivanov's one-name novel.
Constantine Hadensky, whose work was also marked by the “Kinotaurus” prize, played the main role of the fascinating failure teacher Victor Servicekin.
Children should study myths and legends as “models of way of life”, says the author.
The tales of the Torah could show that “a hard force cannot defeat a subtle trick”, and legends about King Arthur show the importance of having a dream.
By saying that many myths would be “if wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too ludicrous for teaching in schools”, Crossley-Holdland advocated “pretty selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it's amazing that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I was in favour of introducing them into the 20-year curriculum.
He added that the “excessive morale” of the authors and teachers “rejected” the interest of children and that the main ideas were “supplied” in exciting stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowof from English and Saxon, also wrote the Norwegian Myth Collection for Penguin and British folk tales, said: “You may have intentions, but you better keep them with you.”
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but that there must be an innate sense of right and wrong.
And this should be subliminarily; it should be disclosed through history, not clearly defined.
Old principle: show, not tell.
In the Voronez region, a football fan was arrested, breaking the window in the waiting room of the station
At 9: 00 p.m. on 29 October, two football fans from the Moscow region were removed from the passenger train by transport police at the Grazi-Voronez station.
After going to play a favorite team, the guys on the way set up a drunk deboss on the train.
Young people were taken to the duty station of the liner police station at the Grozy station for the preparation of an administrative offence report.
There the fans repented of their antisocial conduct.
The police filed administrative material against them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and waited for him to arrive at the station station.
On the afternoon of the first night, the fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the window of the front door in the waiting room of the station.
A transport police officer and the RWC P.P.P.C.S.S. were on the phone.
They were able to arrest the attacker who tried to escape the scene.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the South-East has been subject to verification.
The issue of criminal proceedings is being raised, and the senior adviser for the transmission of information and public relations of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the transport of Sergey Olhowick.
Vitaliy Mothko: Waters?
I think we're back 15 years ago.
The Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, gave his opinion on the riots in the rostrums during the Russian Cup “Shinnik” - “Spartacus”.
I'm a supporter of sports events: clubs, leagues, Russian Federation.
But we're seeing that they've taken a smog stand.
They're waiting for someone from the side to come and set things right.
That's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
You have to organize fans, clubs have to invite their stewards, not do business alone.
We have now drafted a special government regulation on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will address this issue in its entirety.
But I will always invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fededan's interview.
State, please, let's get the law quick.
It feels like it's Bavaria fans who came to Jaroslavl and they made it all up.
We're outsiders.
In fact, it's terrible to see the stand being hunted from a firewall.
And it's in a country that's preparing for the world championship.
"I feel like we're back 10 to 15 years ago," said Mutko.
Snowden Can Be Interrogated in Russia
American intelligence officer Edward Snowden is not likely to go outside Russia to testify in cases involving the audition of German chancellor Angela Merkel.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, an American can answer questions from the German Attorney-General's Office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
“In that case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by the US Allied Countries,” said the Agency's interlocutor.
“At the same time, in principle, the FIU could send its representatives to the FIU or transmit written questions to Snowden”, added the source, adding that the matter should be addressed at the inter-State level.
Previously, German Bundestag deputy Hans-Cristian Strabele had reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the German Chancellor of Germany's audition case.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or on German territory.
The CIA ex-worker made it clear that he knew a lot.
Although the U.S. NSA blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to travel to Germany.
However, this requires a clear definition of all the conditions for his arrival,” reported Strebel to the Euronews television channel.
Snouden Anatoly Kucheren's lawyer, commenting on the Interfax source's statement, stated that his client could cooperate with the German investigators, but when and how to decide.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he made known information about U.S. intelligence operations on Internet surveillance.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but he was unable to leave the airport because his passport was cancelled by the U.S. authorities in absentia and remained in the transit zone of Sheremevievo airport until early August.
On August 1, Snowden received a temporary asylum document on Russian territory for a period of one year and left the “Sheremitevo” the same day.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren stated that his client had been employed by "a large Russian company".
The NSA's surveillance of Angel Merkel last week was reported by German media.
According to journalists, the chancellor's telephone conversations began in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located in the US Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after publishing this information, stated that the monitoring of Merkel was in violation of German laws and sovereignty.
Ponomarev left "The Just Russia"
A member of the State Duma from the Fair Russia Party, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he filed the application with the Party ' s New Siberian Regional Office.
According to its statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of “survivors”.
We're sitting down drinking tea...
"Why do many want to see "Ilya Ponomarev puts a partisan on the table," but there's nothing so landmark," commented the deputy.
Ponomarev noted that good relations with the regional office of the “esers” were maintained.
However, Ilya Ponomarev, a deputy of the State, does not intend to give up his mandate.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and was legally unable to leave it.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarieva's intention to leave the fair Russia party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that he would be accompanied by Dimitri Gudkov and Valery Zubov, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese MIDA Fumio Kisid met the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“We would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of the political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty”, stated at the Kisid meeting.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that since the visit of the Prime Minister of Japan, Sinzo Abe, relations between the countries had become more warm and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation would meet Japan on complex political issues, writing RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of disputed Northern Territories.
As a result, there are protests in Tokyo today calling for the return of land lost after the Second World War.
There are cars driving through the Japanese capital from which the loudspeaker says, "Come back to the northern territories!".
Police don't stop protesters, they keep an eye on noise levels.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New York
We can boldly say that New York is the birthplace of American comedy stands: almost a hundred years ago, a concertist named Frank Fay, who worked at the Palace Theatre Theatre Theatre Theatre in Broadway, started to tell jokes directly to the public in conversational manner.
Fay's innovation was eventually captured by others, most recently the New York comedy festival.
Created and managed by Caroline Hersh, the founder of the Carolines Club, this year's festival celebrates its tenth anniversary, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these hidliners started at Carolines and then made more progress, reached a level where they are already too famous to perform at a club," said Hersh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes Vanda Sykes, Cathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the "Grandap for Heroes" -- an annual music-commediate charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsstein, John Stuart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be among the others.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several comics participating in this year's festival have become popular in a non-traditional way, for example through small television shows such as Company Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was famous for his role in the comedy series on a little-known cable TV channel (the FXX League on FXX on Fantesi Football) and now runs his own sketch show on the Comedy Central.
Jenny Sleit became an actor both on "Super Saturday Night" and on "Parks and Recreation Zones", although she is most known for the series of "Marsel-Treaty-Breaks in Botches".
Both Croll and Slat, like other young comedians with their own style, are a product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Stanberg started out as a camera comedian, but then he became a successful director on television and in the movies, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the lead show on TV Land, called Sit Down Company with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly the centrepiece of Larry’s work,” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he would sometimes walk a street between the two houses and think, "Well, if I don't have any money, I might be living here."
Pakistan authorities have begun negotiations with local Taliban
Pakistan has begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of that country in the United Kingdom, where Pakistan ' s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, is visiting.
The Head of Government of Pakistan made a statement on the negotiations with the Islamic extremists during the meeting with British Vice-Primeman Nick Kleg, with which he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reform in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister reported that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun, as stated in the statement of the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said he hopes and prays for dialogue to work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan,” the diplomats added.
Pakistan ' s Taliban (Techreq-and-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of a single Afghan movement, but operate independently in the north-west of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistan ' s Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
In the past, the Islamabad Government had attempted to enter into negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused dialogue.
It stated that it would only negotiate if the authorities sent troops deployed to permanent locations in Taliban areas and released arrested Islamists from prison.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
The oil fell in price to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about large stock formation overshadowed a report showing that China ' s energy-intensive production sector was gaining momentum.
The U.S. reference oil in December was cheaper than 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel later in the morning for European time in electronic tenders at the New York commodity exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was cheap by 39 cents, a 5.8 per cent drop in October price.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy stated on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
Within five weeks, the stock was more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports of the Chinese industry, which showed an upsurge in its activity.
This indicates that the recovery of China ' s economy can continue to gain strength after the third quarter ' s growth rate rose to 7.8 per cent after the twenty-year minimum in the previous quarter.
The oil brent, also used by U.S. refineries, has fallen by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the London Intercontinental Exchange.
Patrick Rua, chief coach of Colorado, explained his decision to release Hilkipper Simeon Warlamov from the first minutes of Friday's "Dallas" match, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian side, handed over to Natalie Schmeleva's Socorpor, "SE".
What shall we wait for,' said Rua after the morning ride of the Lavin.
Of course, we all worry about what happened, but we are confident of it and feel that it will be beneficial for him to go out on ice today.
We want him to go to the ice and show us his usual level.
So you're pretty sure the situation didn't affect the spectators at all?
We'll see.
Surely our players will support Varley by helping him to guard the gate, as was the case in previous games during that season.
Above all, no one on the team will draw any conclusions until the court decides.
You don't have to be a vegan in Siberia. The greenhouse tomato won't replace the soup.
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, a correspondent named RIA Novostya explained.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
They can't move the winter without losing their health, and no greenhouse tomatoes can compensate them, and New Siberian diets and doctors are seen as polled the day before Vegan Day.
Drink Oil Litres
Strict vegetarianism, when not only meat and fish are rejected but also milk, honey, eggs, become fashionable.
However, diathetologists are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, such strict eating standards are at least useless for their health.
The total rejection of animals is harmful.
Proteins contain irreplaceable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for with vegetation.
You have to include at least milk or eggs in your diet," I'm sure of Marina God's diet.
It gives an example of fish containing irreplaceableUmega-3 fatty acid.
Their richest vegetable oil is linen.
"To buy it for human consumption, we need to drink it in litres," says a nutritionist.
The medical community is confident that the people of Siberia should give special attention to the winter diet.
During this season, vegetarianism is particularly called into question.
Our realities have placed high demands on food.
To avoid freezing, you need higher calories.
“If a person restricts himself by animal products, he lacks this caloricity,” says an expert.
That's what Olga Pozniak, a nutrition doctor, agrees.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruit are not the answer.
It is better for a person to eat mainly foods grown in the region where he or she was born.
The genetic code is geared to better digestion and digestion of these products.
And in the winter, people want not a cucumber but a hot soup or something else," the doctor explains.
According to her, from the fact that there may be vegans, there are truly different kinds of crops, grains, beans, local vegetables, apples left in the winter, frozen berries.
But that, of course, is not enough to eat enough.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifoulina, the level of vitamins in anthrax is sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete change to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when temperatures can change by 30 degrees Fahrenheit per day and in May of snow, is inappropriate.
Organism for life needs energy, and that's fat in the first place," says the medical doctor.
Doctors point out that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up and need building materials, including amino acids.
And by being vegetarian, we give them inferiors.
Those who are pregnant also need more protein, vitamins and micronutrients in the menus.
"The vegans miss them," I'm sure of God.
Arithulina says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants, "to play whatever toys he wants."
He's got his body, his skeleton, his organs.
And yet the children must be fully fed.
If his parents deprive him of any micronutrients or amino acids, choosing what he will eat for him, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The shortage of certain substances for brain, eye and bone development will not be restored tomorrow," she said.
All medical professionals interviewed agree on the poor quality of winter-growing greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains fewer micronutrients than (cultivated) in the open ground.
"The quality of the food is wrong," God says.
Arithulina also notes that imported and warm vegetables and fruits are far from perfect standards.
At times, the desire of producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
"The apples don't turn brown on the cut, the cucumbers are quick to yellow and fertilize, the tomatoes are untasteful and nearomat", and gives examples of the medical add, adding that they are likely to be overheated with an excess of fertilizer.
And they're not the suppliers of vitamins, they're the cages.
This is not the case with Vera Petruk, a candidate for agricultural sciences, the Siberian Institute of Agrarian Physics and Technology.
She said that with the right approach and compliance with all the rules and requirements in greenhouses, it was possible to produce full - grown vegetables.
If they try to get the larger out of a square meter, of course, they will get watered more frequently and feed plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too many nitrogen fertilizers, the tomatoes are growing rapidly, they are large but watery and not pleasant," she explains, adding that the issue of quality depends primarily on the manufacturer’s conscience.
The Court suspended the implementation of the “stop-and-search” decision at the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal of the Federal District suspended the enforcement of a court order requiring changes in the “stop-and-search” programme of the New York Police Department and suspended the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the enforcement of Judge Shira Sheindlin ' s decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution by carrying out a programme on street detention and interrogation.
The city appealed against its decision and remedial orders, including the order to appoint a supervisor to assist the police station to change its practice and related training.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a debate by the parties on the motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that it was necessary to dismiss the judge because it had violated the U.S. judicial code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid showing bias, partly because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to the court ' s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly addressing blacks and Latin Americans under the “stop-and-search” programme.
It appointed an external controller to oversee major changes, which included policy, training and monitoring reforms, and decided to launch a pilot programme to test tele-circuit cameras in police stations where most detentions took place.
In August, New York decided to cease the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose cases had been terminated after the police check.
The debate on the city ' s appeal is scheduled to take place after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactics have been criticized by numerous civil rights lawyers.
The search and search process has been under way for several decades, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor of Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, the majority of whom are Blacks and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, filed a collective action.
Supporters for the “stop-and-search” programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to unfair practices, create a more reliable and effective police service and may influence how other police departments implement these practices.
Opponents claim that changes will reduce the violent spirit of the police rather than the level of crime, lead to unnecessary spending and will not solve the more global problem of complex police conditions owing to a reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she continued the practice of “stop-and-search”, which was in accordance with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York Police stopped people.
A pedestrian zone was opened in the area of the Tremkov Gallery
Moscow has a new pedestrian zone.
It is located in the area of the Trekow Gallery and covers a section of two kilometres from the Novokuznaya subway station to the swamp Square.
All over the place are street torches, flowering houses, benches, urns and toilets, and the removal of deaf fences and illegal advertising.
In addition to Clement’s and Lavrusin’s alleys, which were already pedestrians, five streets were closed for cars: Ordin’s dead end, Big and Small Tolmachev alleys, Kadashev Coastal and Wetland Square.
Traffic in the streets of Marseek and Petrovka is not limited.
At the section of Friday Street from the Novokuznaya Lobby to Clement Street, conditions for pedestrians were created without the removal and cutting of the carriageway, passing newssmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Third Gallery, the temple of the priest Clement of the pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments, and other attractions.
Previously, the complete pedestrians were the Twer Pass, the Tablets of the Streets of the Kuznetsky Bridge.
The large Dmitrov, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, was decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone hack to check for confidential messages
The former editor of The News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used “the breaking of the telephone, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm the false information about Charles Clarke's novel at that time as Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor and Royal Counsel, Andrew Edis, informed the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005, the News of the World received false news that Clarke was meeting with her “involvemental special adviser” Hanna Polby.
The newspaper ordered a private detective, Glenn Mulkeira, to hack into Polby's voicemail and alert her to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voicemails, and heard the court.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will be standing next to someone's house hoping to catch someone suddenly, is a man who likes to offer a story to people to see what they say,” said Mr. Edith.
He said that the News of the World had used three ways of investigating stories: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor was personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, about the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
Clarke's novel was the first to draw attention to News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
The tape received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulkaira ' s house in August 2006.
Investigators also found recordings on a private detective's computer of Ms. Polby and her sister as “projects”.
During the period she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls requesting information on her, Mr. Edith said.
During this period, former Chief Reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weserap monitored Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her voice message on June 18, 2005, Coleson said: “I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow, which I would very much like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said that Coulson ' s participation in the story was similar to that of other influential people, such as former Minister of the Interior, David Blancett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had been in confrontation with Mr. Blancett about the affair with a married woman while he himself had met with a representative of Rebecca Brooks, who was married at that time.
Coleson and Brooks deny conspiracies with other people for cell phone hacking between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkair, Turlbeck and Wezerap confessed to breaking the phones.
Snowden is ready to speak to the FWG authorities in the case of the audition.
CIA ex-worker Edward Snowden is willing to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with FAR authorities, hands over the RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA official to the FAR at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele through which Snowden delivered a message to the German authorities.
Strebele met Snowden the previous day in Moscow.
Four people were injured by a fire on Tver Street
Four passersby were injured by fire in a collector in the centre of Moscow on Tver Street.
According to Interfax, with reference to the source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby who were in a smoked underground crossing during a fire were injured.
As RIA Novosti writes with reference to Paul Livinsky, head of the capital fuel and energy department, electricity is now fully restored in all houses on Tver Street.
The fire in the heat collection near the house 15 on Tver Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
Heavy smoke came out of the vents, and in an underground crossing located at Armania’s store, there was smoke.
As a result of the burning, 11 houses on Tver Street were destroyed.
At 9:45 a.m. Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
U.S. cuts the food allowance for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four falls by $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial security of the food stamps known as the “Fudstamps” is declining, as the relevant State programme is in operation.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be 36 less dollars a month than before, by officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, the average benefit per person was $133 per month.
Food aid expenditures in the United States increased to $80 billion per year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid provided by the Foodstamps, which has been known since the past when they were in paper coupon form.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
The Republicans in Congress, however, demand further reductions in the funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should aim to assist those who need it most.
Food store owners throughout America are concerned that cuts will reduce consumer spending.
United States Congresses continue to debate how government funding can be further reduced.
Blazzard released a 19-year-old platform player free of charge
Blazzard's studio released Blackhorne on PC free of charge.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game has become available in Battle.net under the classics of Blazzard.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts relate to the American part of the service are currently able to download them.
The game is not yet available to Russian users.
According to media reports, the version that Blizzard now released on PC does not appear to be different from the original version of the game.
Soundtrack to Blackhorne also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne, released 19 years ago by Blyzzard, was originally released on SNES consoles.
It took place on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and bright kingdoms.
One day, a dark ruler named Sarlak decided to kill Light King Vloros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlarós Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight the Sarlak men and to protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its name was changed to above.
It used to be called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackhorne's publisher was Interplay.
In Moscow's subway, new assault rifles will appear.
But they'll sell tickets to passengers, not for money, but for sitting down.
One trip, worth 30 rubles, will cost a potential passenger 30 seats.
The number of arrivals will be calculated by means of modern technology, and the ITAR-TAS will refer to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first will be installed at Exhibition Station on 8 November 2013.
The President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zukow, and the Olympic champions of Alexei Nemov and Elena Younger, will be the host for the presentation of the new tickets.
Recognition by the National Security Agency reinforces corporate paranoia with respect to State surveillance
On a warm day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low over the United States Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On instructions from the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service was assigned to take a picture of the roof of the US Mission Building, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media report that BfV was hoping to detect the antennas of the listening devices, which led to negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, once again assured the U.S. in September that the U.S. did not take advantage of external intelligence “to steal foreign companies' commercial secrets for the benefit of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profitability”.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract official who had become an exposer, began publishing his treasure of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure if they can trust the director for his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency had monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrrobras and had access to data stored from US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, had raised corporate paranoia caused by State surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was reported that Angela Merkel’s phone had been auditioned for perhaps ten years.
If Europe's most influential personry can be a target, then business leaders are certainly potential targets.
Snowden made evident intensive cooperation between United States intelligence services and companies.
I think it's likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Groun, president of BITMI, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT company.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now presents almost the same risk as China in industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the EY consulting agency.
All the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, however, still did not show that the US had transmitted commercial secrets to foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks some information technology and Internet capabilities and felt that it should attempt to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical of this.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to build German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gaso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If there's a need for a powerful European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
And yet, the coverage and technical development of U.S. spy agencies, known for their discoveries by Snowden, have been a shock to some companies that previously believed that China was at the greatest risk of surveillance.
A major shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European company leaders are better aware that data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by Claude Security Alliance Trade Association, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to plan to use the US cloud provider after exposing an American intellectual analysis program for Prism data.
Jim Snapebe, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn't arise a year ago, namely, where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are merely a confirmation of what they already knew: the powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and thus must be protected at all costs.
Economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always happened.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate,” says Kurt Bock, principal executive director of the BASF chemical company.
The Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them, because it is within our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders generally do not like to boast about the responses they have taken, as this may give advantage to the adversary.
In large companies, it has long been assumed that taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unsupervised in a hotel room is at least imprudent.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi car company, says that for many years this has been a standard practice of collecting mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that company managers consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
The paid mobile phones are then thrown away.
Nevertheless, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their specific niches.
“Low and medium-sized companies often lack expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access”, warns the BfV report.
The US warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
A U.S. national intelligence report in February placed France, together with Russia and Israel, in a second series of violators engaged in hackering for economic exploration after China, claims The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that “Frenchs are the worst” when it comes to economic espionage.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, reportedly stated in an interview this month: “The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a youth from Georgia who died because of a "unhappily accident" believe that their son was killed
The parents of a youth from Georgia whose body was found inside a closed sports mat in his high school gym think their son was killed, said a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdost State Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical mat, docked behind the stands in his high school gymnasium.
Investigators of the Lawnes District Sheriff's Office have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old challenges this.
“They are absolutely sure their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed that he died the way the sheriff says.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, the laws of physics and common sense,” said Kramp.
They think it's a cover-up to protect the person or the people responsible for their son's death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to the body bag,” he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at the press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts, no matter where they go.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds” for a formal inquiry, he said.
Moore told the reporters that the primary autopsy showed that Johnson had died as a result of “positional asphyxiation”.
However, Moore’s second discovery showed another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman ' s spokesman ' s representative from the County of Loundes was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to publish all video recordings of the surveillance cameras that the investigators had seen.
The adolescent's parents said they hoped that the videos contained the key to solving how he died.
Spartacus: For information on the persons who displayed the fascist symbol
The official Spartaca website contains a statement by the Moscow Club regarding the appearance of the Fascist flag at the rostrum in Yaroslavla.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. Government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The management provides information to schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and service personnel about food allergies among children and how to assist in the event of an allergy reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep a supply of adrenaline — most commonly used for injections — EpiPen automatic syringe — to help with potentially deadly anaphilia.
State legislatures have recently amended regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline stocks with fewer difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergic reactions.
Children may say: “A feeling like something in my tongue”, “a sense like I have hair in my language”, or “a tongue of chirping”.
Parents of intersexual children may choose “undetermined sex”
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with intermediate-type external sex organs.
Newborns will no longer have to be assigned male or female.
The new law does not require parents to name any sex of such children, allowing parents to identify the gender as “undetermined” or “undetermined” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions on the sex transaction for newborns and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
One intersexual person, according to BBC, said many years later, “I'm not a man or a woman.”
I'm going to be a doctor's slab with blues and scars.
Approximately one of the 2,000 children born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed as “sexual abuse” — a collective term for people with typical chromosomes, gonades (juices or seeds) or unusually developed external sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
The gender identity has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if the gender cannot be defined, it is better to use all available information and assign it to it than to wait and track the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dreser, who specializes in gender identity issues, said that the new German law “sounds like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life - threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children do not,” he said.
You can assign a sex without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions as to why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as different from transsexual or transsexual persons, since their status is not related to gender, but rather to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to male or female sex, but is typical of both sexes at the same time or is not specific to any of them.
These characteristics may be found in secondary sex, such as muscle mass, hair-cover distribution, breast and body fat; primary sex, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by inter-sexual and trans-gender people in the field of employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice-based crime.
Boys with gender bias now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to place male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May Wellby, was the first person in the world to be recognized as “non-pollutant” to stand in court for a lifetime of “undetermined” sexual status.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third symbol in addition to M and F - X, i.e. intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release in France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, this strongly expressed Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also disagreed with German law, stating that “in a situation in which the world is involved in a new state of choice where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we turn two more pillars of civilization”.
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported on Baby Zone's website that she would have preferred that children have sex at birth.
“It is difficult to raise a child without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child”, she said to the parents' website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital organs were called Hermaphrodites, a beautiful Greek god with both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community saw the gender as a piece of paper on which to erase everything and then draw it again.
But now many argue the ethical basis for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make wrong choices without knowing how a child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called an "immediate psychiatric incident," said Dreser.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist; you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was suggested by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hawkins University, who felt that the gender could easily be changed.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social signals — how parents grow a child — interact with the child's genes and hormones to determine whether a person would consider himself to be a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during reckless circumcision to completely castrate the child, also removing his testicles, and raising him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it was not,” said Dreser.
When he was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But when he was 38 years old, he committed suicide.
Dreser said some doctors are still "applying this model" right now.
But in the 1990s, with the Internet coming in, the survivors of these sex-change operations declared themselves “unsatisfied with the result”.
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes but intermediate-type genitals.
The doctors were unable to determine precisely whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a man's “full life. ”
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external genital organs and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I was not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned a vagariesman.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual abuse that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal development of genitals.
When he learned the truth, he became a man again, receiving the injections of the testosterone and removing his breast.
The operation made him barren.
Today, he is defending others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring people's perception of intersexuality into line.
But Ann Themer-Mattis, executive director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informable Choice, is concerned that German law “encourages tagging and stigma”.
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give the child a ‘undetermined sex’,” she said.
We're afraid that he'll promote intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen this law reveal itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tehr-Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law, since “it allows adults to choose for the third gender”.
“ grown-ups should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender”, she said.
The German law implies her appropriation at birth.
It is a battle in which young children should not engage at this stage.
When they grow up, they'll be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a tentgenologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter who is sexually disabled and who is helping hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law would “support” both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Cathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “the complete insensitive syndrome of the Androgens”.
Since her receptors are not working properly, Cathy has developed women’s traits.
She has a vulture, but she doesn't have a uterine or ovarian.
Now, at the age of 29, Cathy is married and is undergoing a child psychiatry college at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or Gestapo surrogate motherhood.
“ The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own, ” said Baracz.
It gives them time to do some analysis and take care of the situation, as well as the time between them before they write "male" or "female."
In such a case, you are doing well — raising a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you are happy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the anxiety that moves their parents, because they don’t feel that they are doing what is right, ” she said.
After all, a child will decide which floor he or she is more comfortable with — and this is wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to make decisions on their own.
Nicholas Habibulin's "Chicago" version stressed that he knew he had to play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at training.
In the last two Jabes' meetings, Habibulin first missed six pikes from Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I've failed to do it, we've got CSNChicago's words for Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, I think I should look at them as games, and try to achieve better results.
You need to study your past games and work out the shortcomings you've had.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training, I feel pretty good.
But for some reason after a few heads, everything turns into some snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little bit.
The gatekeepers - I don't think I'm so alone - always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not excited.
It doesn't matter what's going on in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself not to miss so many pucks.
It's great that my classmates are supporting me, but in principle it's easy: I have to play better.
Two games aren't all season, but I wanted to do them much better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'm just gonna try and play the next game better.
At Altae, the bus was turned over.
In the Rubtsov district of Altay Province, a PAZ flight bus crossed.
An accident was reported to have affected 13 people and reported to the MES Regional Office.
Previously, 10 victims had been reported by law enforcement agencies in the region.
According to the agency, the accident took place about 9 a.m. on a local timeline on the Novonkolaevka - Vishnevka road, a mile [1 km] from Novonkolyka.
There were 12 passengers and drivers on the bus from Rubtszsk to Vishnevka, all injured to various degrees of gravity and hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to the City Hospital No. 1 of Rubtsak, and two persons were hospitalized at the Rubtska CRB.
Bears expect SSJ-100 to be shipped to Europe
The Russian Federation expects that once the markets of Latin America and Asia have been established, the Superjet 100 aircraft will also be shipped to Europe.
“We expect that, in total, we will receive such arrangements by more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type.” Interfax cites the words of Russian Prime Minister Dimitri Medvedev at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Airo.
The head of the Russian Government noted that serious cooperation had been established with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, it will also be provided to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that he will ever be sent to France," stressed the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Civil Suhogo, in partnership with Alia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed using modern technology and offers high quality and comfort standards for 100 passenger seats.

In an old - fashioned way, the peasants on the high pillar placed a wheel against the cart, and the heavy nest was well held.
Such special supports have long been removed, so the atheists loved the poles of the power lines - the interwoven branches rely on wires, which make the aristine house sound safe.
Anja’s grandmother, who had lived in the village of Ivanovka in Petrikovsk for 20 years, began to see her nest settle despite the efforts of her inhabitants.
The birds are putting new branches on top, and the lower layer is already sitting between the wires, and it's about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity for the family of arists who nested at the court every year, pulled out and fed three or four of them in the summer, but they don't want to be without light.
As soon as the birds left for the warm places, Anna’s grandmother called the King’s Recon, who owns the support.
I didn't even expect them to respond so quickly.
When our specialists came to Ivanovka, they were surprised to find that the nest was still in place, ” told DTEC Technical Director, Dniproblanergo, Sergei Berezowski.
The conductor’s wires, which were actually inside the nest, weighed between 150 and 200 kilograms [150 and 200 kg], began corrosion.
At any moment, the birds could have been killed by electric shocks.
The locals were also at risk of being left without light because of damage to wires.
Therefore, liners have begun rescue operations, not for the first time in our practice.
Andnithologists at the Dnipropetrov National University have helped with the design of a system for transporting the nest.
They conducted trainings for district network personnel.
The well-known Dnipropetrov ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised energy engineers at all stages of the reconstruction of the nest.
It was first estimated that more than 50 clean “headquarters” were in emergency condition.
Special metal platforms, similar to the funnel, have been set up for their reconstruction.
The base was welded with evave branches and then moved to the old nest.
According to experts, it is sufficient to lay the old branches as a basis for birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Then the Aist will build up their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was renovated in the village of Pesčanka, in the Novomoskov district.
A new concrete pillar was placed next to the electrical support, and a platform was placed on it with an old, already inhabited nest.
The whole operation cost nine thousand dollars.
And the other day, the same newcomer took place in the village of Ivanovka in Petrikovsk, in the courtyard of Anna’s grandmother.
Here the platform was placed in its original place, only above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that the cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their “headquarters ” were renovated.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction is awaiting four more nests in the areas of Ochland and the Kingdom of Dnipropetracy.
By the way, while some are saving rare birds, others are ruthlessly killing them.
The whole area had heard the sad news the other day, in the village of Ust-Kamek of the Apostolic Region, on the day of the pheasant hunt, and poachers had shot a swan family living on a local pond for entertainment.
The noble birds were not afraid at all of the people - the locals fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, and four swans were already lying on the water dead.
Now officers of the Apostolic Police Department are discovering who shot the birds in the Red Book.
"Russia March" is getting more popular
On the 4th of November, on the Day of People's Unity, Moscow will be with the Russian March.
According to the “Levad-Centre” survey, support for the Russian marches is growing - 40 per cent of citizens already have different approvals.
According to Lavada Center, 40 per cent of citizens have different approvals for “Russian marches”, of which 11 per cent are definitely positive and 29 per cent are “better positive”.
The popularity of the Russian marches is gradually growing - in 2006, only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed them, and in December 2010 the number of citizens supported such activities (28 per cent).
“Presently negative” refers to “Russian marches” only 7 per cent of Russians, “faster than negative” 19 per cent.
A further 35 per cent were unable to formulate their attitude towards this action.
This year, Moscow's mayorate agreed to hold a “Russian march” of up to 15,000 people in Ljublino, as the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majoorov, reported today.
This nationalist action has been taking place every year on the Day of People ' s Unity since 2005.
In response to a question from sociologists, "Have you heard that on 4 November the Russian marches are being held in Russia under the slogans of the protection of Russian rights in Russia?" Three quarters (75%) of the citizens replied negatively.
Currently, only 1 in 5 Russians (20%) know about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 nearly one third of the citizens (31 per cent) were heard on the Russian marches.
Remember, three years ago, on 11 December, a natural rally of nationalists took place in Manage Square, which turned into riots.
Levada-Centre also asked the Russians what kind of holiday was celebrated on 4 November.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (People's Unity Day) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
However, only 15 per cent of the citizens gather to celebrate the celebration.
Approximately the same number (17%) intend to celebrate 7 November October as the Day of the October Revolution.
Most citizens (62 per cent) do not intend to celebrate any of these holidays.
As Moscow's mayor agreed to "Russian March" in Ljublino
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to the holding of the Russian March on 4 November in Ljublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian association, the organizer of the march, Dimitri Demukkin.
In addition to the march to Ljublino, there will be a rally and a rock concert of the Kolovrat group, also agreed with the authorities, on the Day of People's Unity.
How was "Russian March 2012"?
On the Day of People ' s Unity in 2012, the nationalists went from the Yakyan Coastal to the Central House of the Artist, where the meeting was held.
The organizers estimated the number of participants per 20,000, and the Ministry called the number 6,000.
Communication: Obama's electoral headquarters considered Baiden's exclusion in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's immediate advisers secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Byden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
It's a discovery -- the most dramatic sensation of all the expected books by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 campaign "Twices are Double: The Game Has Changed 2012."
The Times received a copy of the book to be released and reported on Thursday evening that the President's immediate assistants had conducted “large-scale studies in focus groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Baiden's exception could help raise hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to the political examiner The Times of Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by high-level officials of the pre-election staff and the White House, namely, the former head of the White House administration, Bill Daily, to assess the impact of the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as Vice-President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded place at the Chicago Pre-electoral Headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only the six closest advisers to the President — including Daily, the former head of Obama's electoral staff, Jim Messin, and the former Senior Advisers to the White House, David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was under consideration.
Stava's double claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden despite their “close personal relationship”, but eventually abandoned this step when their data showed that the Clinton election list did not “enhancing the substantial chances of Obama”.
In an interview with Martin Daily, the Administration actually considered the possibility of replacing Byden Clinton.
“I've been actively advocating a lot of things, and that's one of them,” Daily said the paper.
You should remember that the president was in a terrible shape at that time, so we thought, "Oh my God, what do we do?"
Although Daily described the study as “necessary verification”, Martin told CNN to Anderson Cooper that the pre-election staff had invested quite a lot in examining whether that step would bring the dividends to the vote.
“The pre-election headquarters don't spend that much money on interviews and focus groups if they don't take something seriously,” said Martin in AK 360.
It is not clear, however, that Obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about a possible shift.
Although he said he didn't think the President was “knowing” a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that Obama probably knew.
Martin added that “Twices are doubled” does not provide a clear answer to the question as to whether the results of the political sensing have reached the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama did not know about the study of the possibility of removing Byden from the electoral list.
"Maybe," replied Martin.
Would you like to shine in the dark of the ice cream?
A British businessman created the world's first luminescene ice cream with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop shining food.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article on jellyfish, and he convinced Chinese scientists to chemically re-establish shining squirrels.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue of the eater, raising the level of pH in the protein and causing it to shine.
Chris says that since the ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the Ice Me Ice Company, says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at the very beginning of production, so it's going to give you about 2 grams of substances."
The protein we use in the ice cream reacts with your language in neutral pH.
So when your mouth heats up the protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will start to shine.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect to present it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful shining effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done, because the luminescence of a jellyfish is four times as expensive as gold.
So every balloon I've got is about 140.
But it's pretty nice to taste.
Charlie’s experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and the taste of aqueous gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop invisible ice cream."
It's not possible by definition because of the fracture caused by ice crystals, which make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
"Avangarda" coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking of preparing his team for the regular CK championship match against Salawata, noted that Omchi had conducted a thorough analysis of the impact of the Métalourg Magneg.
The specialist stressed that Avangard needs to focus on defense games.
We've been watching video games against "Methallurg", and we're bringing up the official "Avangard" website for Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of puck, not a very nice moment.
We missed because of our mistakes, because we didn't do the game job.
We knew the rival had performers.
By statistics, they had five attacks on their way -- three pucks killed us.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in preparing for today's game?
We're going through every game with the guys, talking after the game, getting ready for a new rival.
The main thing is to have the installation run.
Everyone saw the first period of a match against Metallurg.
The game was done and the score was 2:0.
Missed the locker's goal and made mistakes in the third period.
Given the difficulty of the game, there was no point in connecting the defence counsel.
We need to defend ourselves by the whole team.
Right now, "Avangard" has a long home series, games go on in one day, and the team's got tiredness?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is the fulfilment of our moments and the performance of the game.
Hawkey is an emotional game, if you do the installation, it's not that hard.
Because of the new regulations introduced by Russian Customs, hundreds of furs have been standing on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donnet officials have promised to provide drinking water to drivers and to install biotuletes
Hundreds of furs were stored at the border crossings at the time of entry into Russia.
This is due to the change in the rules for the handling of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm that the Russian side is in line and that it has not given any warning of innovation.
Since 28 October, the Russian Customs authorities have introduced additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, reports Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Chief of the Eastern Customs.
A new model document is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The crossing points are in an enhanced mode.
FACTOV's correspondent visited the border and spoke with the far-reaching hostages.
Prices in the road-café shop at the Novaavossk pass are rising every day, as are the bus queues.
The trucks are in several rows, reaching about two kilometres.
The Novoazowsk Customs Terminal-Weselho-Vozenica provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
The goods are then shipped to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sundays, before midnight, they were released and the rules were introduced, and Alexei Golovanev, a long - distance fighter (in photo) who is carrying goods through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been in his car for almost a week.
By the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the goods and the distance at which they are carried.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5,000 roubles (about 1,100 - 1,300 roubles).
Those who travel nearby (let's say Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo value of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 roubles (3,800 roubles) and pass.
And the rest of them are stuck, 'cause no one has that much money with them!
Imagine if a driver carries a load of only $4,000, but to Moscow, he has to pay 90,000 roubles (almost 23,000 hryvnias) for his transit!
The conditions for survival on the border -- none -- are netted by long-distancers who eat near their cars.
The border stores and the cafes are always expensive, but prices like this have never been met anywhere!
The sellers were directed and quickly bred — 15 hryvnias worth a bath, 7 hryvnias worth a cup of coffee, and 25 hryvnias worth a plate of soup.
It's one.
And there's no toilet.
We're sleeping in the steppes, and we're going to the bathroom.
Don't wash or shave...
I can't get out of my car for a week. My wife got me ready to go.
A week ago, Victor Scotrenco, another long-distancer, was comforting himself.
Will my car get a line in a week?
Why do you have one and a half quarts of water?
There's 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, a bottle of crystal or water on silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
You take something else while you have it, you're a salesgirl.
After the situation began to be highlighted in the media, the plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities in the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosiev and Novoaz Paradise Administrations was instructed to provide drinking water to all who line up on the Ukrainian-Russian border, as stated by the Acting Chairman-in-Office of Donetsk, Sergey Dergunov.
The ambulances are now on duty to the ambulances.
Biotoilets will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the next issue will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the Donetsk press service, 32 and 68 vehicles were being made available at the international crossing points “Uspenka” and “Noovazovsk” as of 31 October, respectively.
The “facts” will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to curse the Lithuanian President
The Russian Federation intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking persons of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership - such a statement was made to the BNS agency by the State Security Department of the Republic (DGB).
Information on this has been published on the DELF portal.
In particular, it is reported that Moscow is going to “tell” President Dal Gribauskate of Lithuania and publish the falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosahirivá, which dealt with the facts of the life story of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence services, the preparation of an information attack is being carried out by the Department of Public Administration Analysis of the Office of the President of the Russian Federation on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Eugenius Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania on several occasions and has participated in the Congress of the People ' s Party of Lithuania.
A member of Department V. Smirnov is also alleged to be a participant in the operation.
According to the Special Service, Smyrnov, under cover of scientific work until the end of 2012, visited Lithuania regularly and contacted local politicians, political scientists and the media.
Smirnova is now prohibited from entering the country.
On the previous day, President Gribauskayte of Lithuania had stated that he was aware of the information technology she was preparing.
In her view, Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and “the country's desire for energy independence” were the main reasons.
The Lithuanian leader had not once criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she claimed that the Kremlin referred to Lithuania as being “insufficiently respectful”.
In addition, Gribauscate accused the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, of introducing “only claims” to Lithuania.
Recall that in September Roswanadzor suspended the import of the Lithuanian "mol" into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products did not comply with the sanitary standards.
On that occasion, the leader of Lithuania stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government should prepare a petition to WTO.
In the United States, the school principal shot down teenagers.
The principals of an American high school for adolescents have literally led to despair.
The man, he said, had to take his weapons and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, young hooligans dropped the man's house with toilet paper.
As a result, the school principal opened fire on adolescents, resulting in several injuries to the leg and a 15-year-old boy's hand.
Since the hooligans were not in the territory of the Director ' s property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on bail at 12.25 000.
Notice, shooting civilians in the U.S. is becoming a terrible trend.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of the city of Rijkrest in California State, California, right on the street.
After that, the criminal took two casual passersby hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
In the past, shooting had been opened at a primary school in Newton, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked in school, she was a teacher.
Shooting at U.S. school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place on 31 January at the American School, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and set up a masquerade for our neighborhood.
Now I look more like a hunk.
I haven't called in in the last two years to give candy to my apartment, and I'm probably not going to be here this year either.
The statistics show, however, that I am a white crow in Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Retail Trade, most Americans — called 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and jewelry.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Federation of Retail Trade predicts $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent in costumes.
This year, at the peak of fashion, sexual things are uninvited.
Women no longer need to be sex workers; they may also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies thanks to the Hobbies of the Dead, and I'm sure the astronauts in the "Daft Punk" will get into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the most frequently sought costumes are zombies, Batmans, pirates, and witches.
Perhaps there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Federation of Retail Trade, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't stop talking.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, laziers, Milk Duds, Twizzlers, and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Trade, these are good news for 41 million children who need candy to conquer our areas.
What's more, we'll buy and -- let's not fool ourselves -- we'll eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is corn beans; yet, according to the National Association of Conders, almost 35 million pounds are sold to Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I've got to solve.
There's nothing like Halloween expressing itself like a ghosthouse.
They have amazing names, such as "Terror behind the walls" (which, by the way, is in this prison), "A fight and a cry" and "A house of shock".
Moreover, according to the American Humans community, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghosthouses in America that generate about $500 million of income, as well as those amazing photos where you almost described what your friend put on Facebook and you can't take away, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like "class expression of face."
And we'll end up talking about the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Tikwa when we were kids, and the cut-off of Jack's lamp was like the decoration of a Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, the fashion for a baby in the pumpkin started only last year thanks to the Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack's lamp, slowly drying up on your wing, probably came from Illinois, which raised 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want to do more homework, visit Tim and Susan Matisdon in Napa, California, and try cutting out any of their pumpkins, which weigh £2032.
The Estonian Ministry of Defense site was restored after an attack by Ukrainian hackers
The Estonian Ministry of Defence site was re-established after the morning cyberattack, reporting to the department's press service.
According to Vice-Centre of the Ministry of Information and Administration of Tymar Petercop, this was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a lot of requests.
Our specialists quickly set up the site, and so far the site has been restored.
“Medical damage done to the Ministry,” said Peter Copy of the Postimees.
According to Petercop, it's too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
“We are bound to analyse the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents altogether”, he admitted.
On 1 November, Anonymous Ukraine posted a message confirming the hacker attack on the Internet site of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia and opposing the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We don't have to be NATO's servants.
The Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of the NATO countries.
Ukraine doesn't need a NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of independent Ukraine.
“Anonymous statement” says.
Previously, the Ministry of Defense reported that the company of the Marine Infantry of the Feodosian Independent Battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Infantry would participate in NATO Steadcast Jazz-2013 command and staff exercises.
As a result of impurity, several schools and a hospital have been closed down.
Four schools in Zimbabwe Province of Southern Matabeleland had to be closed because of the attack on students... Goblins.
As the local elder explained, the children panicked, and it proved impossible to continue their studies.
The story of Goblins may sound like a child’s invention for a European, but in Africa it is a serious argument to close the school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean force.
In summer, for example, a hospital was closed in Zimbabwe because the hospital was also attacked by hoblins.
Proclaimed Land Rover Race Series
Inside are the racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as the internal communication system.
In addition, modernized brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between activities can be obtained.
Drew Bowler, the manager of Bowler Motorsport, said, "The rallyers turning to Bowler have changed."
Some of them are not experienced runners, but are people who are looking for excitement, adventures and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to propose such a way, in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare the participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the Rillyreid.
We were very happy to develop a Defender Challenge car -- it's a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides for one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
The Russian forces are not aware of the Brate Circle group - New News
This is referred to by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After media reports of Leps being placed by the U.S. Ministry of Finance on a checklist on suspicion of being a member of the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate "Brats", we looked through all the databases but did not find such a group,” said the interviewer.
In his view, the dissemination of the information helped to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which was allegedly operating abroad.
As the U.S. Department of Finance previously wrote, yesterday it published on its website a list of alleged members of a criminal group called the "Brat Circle".
Among them were the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He's on the list as "Grisha," put it on the eve of the day.
They match the data of a popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevride, creatively pseudonym, place and date of birth.
Except for Lepps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another member of the former USSR whose nationality is not specified.
In the U.S.A., Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuquet Island, is convinced that he was transporting money to bandits at their request.
A photograph of the singer is attached to the communication and all its data are correct.
What's more, Lepp really recently bought a house on Phuket.
The agency noted that it intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
A person ' s blacklisting of the American Minfin would result in the freezing of his assets in the United States and the ban on business contacts with him by persons residing in the United States.
Lepp's assistant, Maya Serikova, said that no notice to the singer had been received: "It's hard to answer the question whether this is Gregory, the one that everyone is talking about right now in connection with the U.S. scandal."
All Lepp knows is media information.
He was not officially notified personally, although I do not know if they occur in such cases.
"And, of course, this is all funny on the one hand, and on the other, amazingly and unexpectedly," she said RIA News.
She says that Gregory Leps doesn't live on Phuket, but according to Minphine U.S., he does have a home on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was currently on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news had caught him on his way to the city of Blavestk.
He escaped to the field in the Shinnik match.
Some details have come to light about the identity of the fan who fled to the field during the 1/16 final match of the Russian Cup between the Yaroslavian Shinnik and the Moscow Spartacus.
According to the head of the FAK, Artur Grigoryantz, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He's in custody at the moment.
"Grigoriantz also described how the fan was able to break into the field, "It turns out that this, let's call it a spectator, went to an ambulance accompanied by two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He came to the ambulance, the ambulance's confirmed to us.
Then he pushed two escorts away and ran off to the field.
He ran from the corner of the Eastern and South rostrums to the corner of the Eastern and Northern rostrums.
He ran through the field.
Managers are responsible for this.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sports Act, this area of action of the stewards - the police cannot interfere in what is in the field.
He ran to the rostrum, crossed the East Palace.
At that time, riots began in the East Palace and on the footpaths,” said the head of the KDC.
We will recall that the KDC decision of the Moscow Spartacus will hold the upcoming 15th round of the Russian championship against Lokomotiva and Zenita and will also pay a fine of 600,000 roubles.
Fire teams were called to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous advance in a career
Coker-Spaniel Ruby escaped after she was involved in a minor accident
Three days later, when she was stuck in a career, she was noticed by a man walking a dog.
Firemen went down a rope on a lush slope to save the dog from imminent death
The pup was fortunate enough to be saved after the fire brigades were called to pick him up and deliver him to a safe place after somehow being stuck 50 feet high on the dangerous slope of the oars.
Nine-month-old Spaniard Ruby fled after being in a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her master, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at the fleppit career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were feverishly looking for their missing dog and posting messages on social media sites after she had fled to a career after a small accident.
At about 2: 15 p.m. on Wednesday, a star dog noticed Ruby standing 50 feet high on the advance of his career.
The technical rescue unit from the Klekhiton fire station hurried down to the scene, went down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used a carrier to lift it up the slope.
Andy Clayton, a rescue officer, said: “She was in a dangerous position.”
It was right in the middle of the suspension slope — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move the muscle during the rescue, she's completely frozen.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate the cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, a rescue officer, said, " Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued."
It was possible that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, and it was determined that she was all right except exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “To watch the rescue was frightening”.
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was back in our hands.
The veterinarian said that if she became exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firemen were great.
It was very bold — what they did.
We were so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of the town of Kitley added: “We were afraid that it might fall, but she stayed there.”
The firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe she got there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview on the Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a bak-vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habits die hard.
Perry said she was having dinner with a webman, and she said, "He was playing with me when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, the representative of the 70-year-old Jagger said that the “categorically denies that he has ever struck for Katie Perry”.
The representative added: “Perhaps it confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests at Rolling Stone this year.
Her new Prism album has been debuted in the first place this week.
George Kérevan: Breaking up with Europe gives Scottishs a choice
One more day, another one about independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European zone of free movement as a condition of EU membership.
Next to the passport control stories in Bervik and the border with barbed wire along Adrianova's shaft.
True, Strathclyde pointed out the possible economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although — which is predictable — it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has anyone indicated that EU member countries spend a lot of time turning their formal rules in the way they are comfortable.
As Scotland is not now part of the Shengen Zone, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from Scottishs.
So it's not a story that deserves attention.
And so old, it became fossilized: for the first time, I heard a "duck" about "independentness means passport control," at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting point lost in the storytelling of an old story.
Why does independent Scotland have to obey European orders at all?
Why change London’s yoke on Brussels’s yoke, especially now?
The real European news is that the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the European crisis, the Europe Project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties against the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining power.
Even in Germany, the “Alternativa for Germany” party, founded only this year, came out of nowhere and obtained almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially evicting the “Free Democracies” (the analogy of our “Liberal Democracies”) from Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition to the federal European plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The severe savings imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the fetters imposed on national economies through the maintenance of a single currency have led many people to think that the “Europe” project has gone too far.
The euro crisis was little because national Governments were working with excessive budget deficits, which was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates beneficial to German exporters — what German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself in a position of disadvantage in terms of production opportunities as compared with Germany.
The only means of rescue is to cut wages and public spending, which Berlin actively supports.
The current problems of budget and currency are followed by the deeper problem of Europe ' s productive capacities.
As a result of the “green” energy package introduced by Brussels — a cipher meaning subsidies from French and German energy companies from the consumer — the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
It's a paralysing price condition, as we've seen in Granjmut.
No global freeze on wages will stop the dramatic victory of the US cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, rebellion is on the rise, especially in France, once the brightest supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on the same level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France ' s devastated economy in distress.
The result is that the right-wing party against the EU, Marin Le Pen, has just won the decisive additional elections by dropping the ruling socialist party to third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of its votes — a timely warning to British Labourers that it cannot be assumed that the right-wing divide will automatically affect the left.
What makes Le Pen's new popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If — and this is very likely — anti-EU parties receive support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my opinion: the rapidly growing moods against the EU and against the single currency in Europe come together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become a sort of vague “European (Sovereign) Nations” that General De Goll liked.
Germany and several dependent economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe would restore their own currencies.
I'm assuming Britain is moving away from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that Britain will be neglected in the cold Atlantic.
How does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to be a region (in fact) of Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect Scotland will be able to succeed in a more free European arrangement, provided we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party Government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement in Europe against the strict economy measures that obtained an impressive majority in 2011 due to objections to the cost reductions proposed (and realized) by the Labour Treasury Chancellor, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent coalition of tori and liberal democracies.
Scotland would now be foolish to vote for independence only in order to adopt the strict economy measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging earlier
African and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is near.
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals were responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity can be one of the early puberty trigger mechanisms
The trend towards early puberty is not so strong in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Eteridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to develop breasts and develop frontal hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At an annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents — this does not usually mean full sexual maturity, ” said Caplovitz.
Visible signs of development, such as growing breasts, frontal and sublime hairs, and body smells, appear earlier in life for girls.
But there was only a slight shift of menarche age (the first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“After breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years before menarche,” said Caplovitz, who is also the author of the book ‘The Early Age of Girls: How to Cope With This Common Problem’.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
Discussions are under way on what constitutes the actual upsurge of sexual maturity, but it is considered “premature” when breast increases are accompanied by a sharp increase to eight years of age.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop — something that a paediatrician can monitor carefully.
Faster progress can be used as a basis for analysis by an endocrinologist in order to avoid serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone ageing, which may eventually lead to slowing down growth and low growth in adulthood.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
The capital is careful about the medications, but recognizes that “repression of puberty can reduce behavioural problems and girls' feelings that they are different from those of their peers”.
Another major problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even about how they can manage hygiene,” said Caplovitz.
“It was a shock, ” recalls a woman whose daughter had menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, it wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school terrified and disappointed that she was the first of her friends.
There are many public theories about the causes of early puberty.
Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual parcels in the media.
Boys — like girls — have earlier sexual growth.
Kaplovitz claims that the most important condition is obesity.
In 2001, it helped to conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9, which links the amount of fat in the body to the age of puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
African American and Latin American girls in the country tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations.
Worldwide, early sexual growth is likely to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery is that while boys have hair on their face and on their foreheads at a younger age, the trend towards full early sexual growth is not as strong as that of girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even infants and children of mixed age are affected by the appearance of hair and frontal hair.
“We need to be careful about how we define true sexual growth, ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at the Horeb Children’s Hospital in Morristaun, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from a paediatrician on how to speak to their child.
“This may mean earlier than expected conversation,” Kaplovitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early on need to be confirmed that even when this happens before it happens, it is a normal part of life.
The U.S. Boeing stuck in Chitt is preparing to take off.
The Treaty's open-air observation flights over Russia and the unscheduled landing of an United States aircraft in Chita on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 a.m. in Moscow, will leave the city's air harbor.
The airport authorities allowed the flight to take place on board, receiving money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the aircraft will fly to Ulan Uda.
According to other data, it's going to go to the U.S.
It is reported that the Ulan Uda aircraft landed in Zabaikal province because of fog.
He was not released from Chita airport due to unpaid accounts.
There are 30 persons on board the aircraft, including the crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reporting to ITAR TAS.
According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under the terms of the Treaty on Open Sky, persons on board aircraft are not entitled to leave Chita airport and can only pass border controls at two Russian airports - in Cuba and in Ulan Uda.
The open-air treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States parties.
Observation flights take place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, to facilitate the monitoring of arms control agreements, to enhance capacity to prevent crises and to resolve crises within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the late famous MK earn in the U.S.
The highest-income ratings of living celebrities in 2013 were headed by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million, caught her.
There's a marked backlog of other famous people who left him last year who've earned a few times less.
Elvis Presley was the second of the most “conceived” of the famous forebes’ lists of the year's history, 55 million per year, and a line below that of Peutus Charles Schulz, 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, former leader (25 million) and musician Bob Marley (18 million), joined the first five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein were also listed.
In Moscow, Igor Gouliev's first beak opened.
On 23 October, Igor Gulliev's first flag barrel was opened in Moscow.
The designer Igor Guliev is known to the general public for his excellent products of the lux meme.
And now they're going to be able to appreciate even more fashion fans -- Moscow's first beak was finally opened, which is what the designer did and had a dolce vita party.
I'm sure Russia has the most beautiful girls.
That's why I'm especially glad I opened up in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there really is a part of me.
Igor cut the red tape and invited everyone who wanted to... to try the models.
Jet manufacturers are hostile to the width of the seat when large orders are on display
There was a fierce debate among the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the long-range tourist seats, setting the tone for the fierce confrontation at the Dubai Air Exhibition this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-range flights to economy-class passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of airlines, while the volume of space allocated to them plays a key role in the allegations of the effectiveness of recent aircraft proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co..
Airbus this week called for the introduction of a industry standard that would provide a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class salons, but its major American competitor Boeing says it should be decided by airlines.
Controversy takes place at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sales of larger versions of their two-motor long-distance fixed-wing aircraft, while potentially record-based orders are expected at the 17-21 November event.
The layout of the rear part of the aircraft — especially if 9 or 10 people are sitting in a row — is central to statements of the cost-effectiveness of new mini-aerobous projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people based on the economic class seats of more than 17 inches in width in each row.
Airbus says that a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in seats 18 inches wide, 9 inches in a row.
Giants of aircraft often exchange technical strikes through professional press advertising.
And now airbus is addressing the public directly in front of the air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to be a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war could be like by showing the financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant close to each other called "Would you agree?"
"Boeing offers long-distance seats more narrower than regional turbovints," said the sales manager of Airbus John Lihi.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when wide-area Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-range journeys, and at the end of the century, the weight of an average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American male in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor follows the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average coverage of what has recently been called a “reactive public” was already in place.
Airbus says he commissioned a study showing that an additional inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests the size of the seats by airbus and says that manufacturers should not interfere with decisions on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and comforts.
She said that research shows that the convenience of the salon is not solely dependent on the width of the seat.
“It's really about providing airlines with choices and opportunities to do what they think they should do to succeed,” said the Boeing Specialist on Kentever's salons.
They don't want us to decide for them what's going to make them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the side, but for suppliers this is increasingly a factor that can influence profits.
After this dispute, there is a flight orders race estimated at at least $700 billion at catalytic prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
The location of seats, as reported for the first time in July by Reuters, is what fuels competition in the battle between the latest jet planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability by one place in their last two-motor highway models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated characteristics of Boeing are partly based on a comparison of the 10-day series 777X with the original 9-day layout of the series of constructive decision 777.
The unit cost gains are reduced by comparison with the 10-day layout currently in use.
“The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than we have developed,” said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus passenger comfort department in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the full 10-day saloons for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“Siting 18 inches wide would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is due to a threat from the 777th model,” said Mary Kirby’s interior engineer, founder and editor of Runway Girls Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide a chair, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world’s sellers of jet planes even carry roulettes with them to check competing plans.
All manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10-member rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the need for additional modifications to the saloons, offering wider passageways to some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to take off, but it can distract attention from the sales wave of the 777X model.
A new anti-niciotenous vaccine can rob the smoking process of pleasure
Scientists have developed an antinicotin vaccine that could deprive them of smoking cigarettes.
One dose of vaccine has been able to protect mice from lifelong nicotine dependence.
Further tests are needed before human testing begins, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystalll of Welle Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available in the market today but who have found their nicotine dependence strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to provide genetic information for the production of antinicotene antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start producing a stable flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before reaching the brain, preventing the smoker from receiving nicotine.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice that were not given a vaccine were "free" and that's a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, say researchers.
These experiments are described in Science Transnational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain high levels of antibodies, injections had to be made so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it converts liver cells into an antibodies factory.
Professor Kristall said that if a future human vaccine were fully safe, it could be given to children before they would like to try a cigarette to prevent nicotine dependence.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them get rid of that habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they warned that more research was needed.
Olives: A third of the rural settlements of Pommoskovia
Vice Governor Podmoskovy Yuri Oleiniki stated that almost one third of the rural settlements in Moscow are fully grantable
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 out of the region ' s budget receive grants.
In 2013, 187 out of 288 settlements received grants from the regional budget.
The share of contributions to the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent of grants.
Within the budget, about 25 billion roubles are channelled from the regional budget,” said Olanik.
Also, the vice-governor noted that only three urban settlements, such as Mystique, Unito and Pushino, had more than one billion roubles for 2013.
Rural settlement revenues in many areas are less than 3 million rubles, “that's not enough”.
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in Podmoskovia is over 70 per cent, “with the quality of services declining”, noted Oleans.
He had previously instructed the municipal heads of Podmoskovia to consider, by the end of November, which settlements needed to be consolidated, integrated into urban districts or changed administrative management systems.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
The Governor of Moscow has previously stated that, as part of the administrative reform in Podmoskovy, it is planned to reduce the number of grant rural settlements.
There is also a request for municipal consolidation in the Cani, Kashirsk, Solnechnogorsk, Colombo, Luberts and Cottniks.
This issue will be discussed in the cities and areas of the region in November.
Igor Brinzalov, President of Modulduma, also stated that the entire structure of the forthcoming ad hoc reforms was planning about 30 rural settlements in 12 areas of Podmoskovya.
This is due to the fact that of 178 rural settlements in Podmoskovy, less than one third have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 have a grant base.
Diana Arbenin celebrated Halloween with her children
Diane Arbenin doesn't hide the great pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Although Arbenina is now particularly devoted to creativity and social activity, she still finds the opportunity to hang out with Martha and Artem, not only spending time studying them but also enjoying them as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diane reported to her worshipers twice about her educational talents.
First, she posted a picture on Facebook showing her children learning to read.
And last night, I had a fan talk, showing how I dressed Artema and Martha on Halloween.
Our first halloween was ready for the broom race, so she called Diane a photo of her children dressed in a birthday costume.
Which is not wise, because they, like any other Russian boy or girl, have a bearing on this celebration because they were born in America.
Germany is the first country in Europe to introduce “undetermined sex” in the registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe where the registration of children born to hermafrodites will be permitted, instead of male or female, to indicate “undetermined”.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the “semi” in the birth certificate incomplete for the time being.
For "F" (female) or "M" (male) parents may temporarily write "X" (undetermined).
This decision is intended to prevent parents from rushing in with a gender-specific operation.
Statistics show that one of the world’s 2,000 newborns is born with hermaphroditis.
Tripodi denies being affected by Obaid.
The former New South Wales Minister of Labour, Joe Tripodi, will represent the investigation of this state's anti-corruption oversight body.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, denies the change in the lease arrangements of the maritime facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who had a secret share in the three real estates on State land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid was lobbying several state ministers for the extension of the Sear Ki leases, where the Obeid family owned two restaurants and cafes, without passing a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obaid ' s secret participation in real estate facilities, after testimony from Mr. Tripodi Lynn Ashpool, former Deputy Chief of Administration, on Thursday.
During the several years of the discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the rent be presented in an open competition.
The tenants were against this and wanted longer lease periods.
In 2009, contracts for enterprises in Cerquillar Ki, which brought some $2.5 million per year to the Obeid family, were extended without an open tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi had acknowledged, had urged changes to the Government's rent policy.
The ICAC ' s e-mail was used in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve This, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid ' s leadership in the Fisheries Division.
“Have the questions raised during these telephone calls been the development of a commercial lease policy?” asked Mr. Tripodi, Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
A senior administrative officer in Fox News interviewed confirmed that Israeli warplanes had targeted the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The officer did not specify what the purpose was, but said that at least one.
The Associated Press reports that Russian-produced missiles SA-125 were targeted.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel had launched air strikes on missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers in Division 457 visas may be tested for “survivibility”
A test for foreign visa workers of Class 457 is under consideration by the Government, as it aims to expand repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied as criteria to prevent the use of Class 457 visas to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole to move family and friends to Australia.
The paper submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Labour Deputy Maxine Mackew criticized the Government's rhetoric regarding foreign workers, saying that this might offend Australia's neighbours.
“Foreign statements such as `Foreigns at the end of line' and `Australasians' represent a very unpleasant departure to a time when trade unions demanded a secure labour market”, she said to the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white work had to be protected — and if some in the region saw the reactions of this historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The document before us sets out 12 measures previously considered by former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brandan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets officials about trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are under consideration.
If the criteria for “validity” are adopted, the applicant may be examined for “whether the candidate is genuine in circumstances where the candidate is a relative or close friend of the owner or a person related to the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also be required to account for the number of visa holders of Division 457 since formerly enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of employees were hired by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seekers died of an infarction after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The nine-year-old son of this man was accompanied by him on his way to Australia, and since his father ' s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by his cousin, who was also on board.
The Australian authorities rushed a man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A friend of Simeon Warlamov stated that hockeyist is an alcoholic.
A friend of Hokkeist Simeon Varlama Evgenius Vavrinyuk said that he suffered from alcoholism, passed on to the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking”, said a woman in particular.
We'll recall that Vavrinyuk sued for beating the Russian-assembly Semen Warlam, who's also a member of the Colorado Club.
She said that the hockeyist dragged her by the hair and beat her, after the attack, her arms, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Warlam himself came to the Denver police and admitted to beatings, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at $5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete from moving around the country, but prohibited him from approaching Vavrinyuk.
He also faces imprisonment for up to six years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact of the HS2 project for Scotland.
The HS2 project involves the opening of a high-speed communication with Scotland and northern England, with the beginning of the First Phase in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baronessa Kramer, noted that the project would “unify Britain”.
The Scottish Minister of Transport, Keith Brown, said that he was “in awe” of the prospect of working out a plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, lines will be drawn in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of constructing a high-speed line between London and northern England from .32.7 to .42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and reduced travel time for North England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the route from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal on HS2 is to establish a genuine national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other.”
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a crisis of capacity in our railway network.
But it is also about urban transport links to each other; 18 cities across the United Kingdom, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive better messages from HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: “Today's announcement is good news for Scotland”.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the general argument for high-speed railways across the UK”.
Therefore, we are pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburg railway line, which the Scottish Government is planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British Ministers next year and taking joint action on the next steps.
Toriy is a new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide for energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative impact on climate.
Renewable sources of energy require large areas for generation.
The atomic energy costs both, but it leaves behind a great deal of expensive waste disposal.
Recently, scientists drew attention to thorium, another radioactive element of the Mendelev system.
It is found around the world, and experts say that its breakup does not leave the waste that has to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite U.S. measures to mitigate these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed United States carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided that they remain in the Airline.
Passengers may already do so during the main part of the flight, but many resent that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required United States airlines to carry out a great deal of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they are not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Authority does not currently have specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft”, it stated.
This issue is regulated by regulations that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time and that require passengers to comply with the safety regulations reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Department, the increased use of the Wi-Fi entertainment system on board, was not against the changes, but stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of permitting the use of electronic devices, because we do think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (a wireless wireless system) is available on our planes,” said the Spokesperson.
Qantas stated that he would comply with the rules in force to date.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change them soon,” she said.
The FAH Regulation applies to United States airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly consider carefully the FAH decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the effect of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their airline.
The transporters will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices and to revise manuals, training materials, manual transport standards and instructions for passengers.
“After the airline has verified and confirmed the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any altitude,” said FAH.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, as recommended by the group, the heavier devices shall be placed under the seats or in the upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The leader of Dagestana hears the notes of extremism in Cuba’s anthem
The football match between Angie and Cuba resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar province and Dagestan after the fans burned down the Dagestan flag, and Cubani’s anthem sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan Ramasan Abdoulatipov on Thursday invited Republican parliamentarians to appeal to the courts because the Gymnodar province of Krasnodar allegedly calls for inter-ethnic discord, in particular the war against the bassurmans.
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Krasnodar province, which was adopted in 1995 today.
It's a shame, and nobody's doing it.
"We are going to death here to remember you as the mother of our mother, our enemy, and the bassurman, for which we are going to write down words like these in an anthem, to vilify some believers for other believers," expressed solidarity with the President of the Parliament of the Hizri Shihsaid.
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Assad
Now, news from the ocean, namely, Syria, where, as we know today, Israel hit Russian-produced missiles that were reportedly intended to be Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important requirement of destroying its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached through the mediation of Russia, which allowed the United States not to conduct the military operation to which it came in close this summer.
Our main international correspondent, Richard Engel, will tell us more about the weapons and what this means for the Syrian President.
Washington stated that the Assad regime would be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August of poisoning gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal made by Assad’s friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will renounce its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had failed the declared chemical factories.
A longer-term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say Assad's days are numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether it's going to happen, but when it's going to happen.
He's no longer legitimate and he has to leave.
But Assad remains.
And it feels even more confident.
Its troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, and many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and baskets.
Many believe Bashar Assad has escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement has been called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has given the impression that he is willing to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child is starved, it is hardly easier for his mother than he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad's holding up.
And changes weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has established a separate Ministry of Construction and the HCC
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has established a new Ministry responsible for building and CHC and has proposed to lead his ex-governor of Ivanov province, Mikhaila Menu, in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Menam at the residence in Novo Ogarevo, and Menen did not refuse to head the new office.
President Dimitri Peskov, Spokesperson for Russia, explained that all construction and TKK functions were being transferred to the new Ministry from the Ministry of the Region.
Mikhail Men - son of the famous Orthodox priest Protoire Alexander Me, graduated from the Gobkin Institute of Petroleum Chemistry in Moscow.
Since 1995, his political career had begun: he had been elected to Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergievo-Posada region and had been a member of the State Duma, the first Vice-Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow Province, the Vice-Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Men was governor of Ivanov province.
The owners in Singapore are doing well while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
Janani Amirhaling, in the Bendemir shopping centre in Singapore, lays a gold bracelet, ring and silver to pay for her daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money has been invested in it”, said Ms. Amirthaling.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, her family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where household debt is increasing — is such that the ValueMax, where it deals, this week became the third slag registered on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Loans on jewellery are not just a quick way to get money (S$1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but are also almost as cheap as unsafe bank loans.
Usually Singapore has an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above 15.4 per cent proposed in the United Oceanas Bank, a local lender with a branch at the same shopping centre.
The advantage, however, is that they do not require a check of creditworthiness or proof of wages and can issue loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people throughout the region are turning to vagrants because families feel pressure because of the higher cost of living and the rapid rise in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and low-cost loans fueled by free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families turn to vagrants to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, pointed to an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk factor to the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia headed this list from 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week is barely out of the technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed an ongoing decline in exports and a decrease in consumer demand.
“The point is that, with rising prices, people in the middle and lower [income] scales will be looking for ways to increase their income wherever they can, ” says Song Sung Wun, economist at CIMB, Malaysian bank.
The relatively high gold prices over the past two years have increased the haste with which people place their personal belongings, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to obtain money for their family ornaments.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the things found in 200 lombards in the city-state are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's put in a golden chain of grandmothers and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest provider of EasyMoney lollbards has seen an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months up to 20%.
Growth in lombard business is such that the ValueMax, an operator of the Bendemir office and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where he has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Jing, Executive Director of MetaMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 per cent of the S$66 million that have been attracted this week by the stock market in Singapore.
While some creditors had caused a fire of criticism because of high interest rates, she said that the Lombard did not only offer cheaper tariffs than other creditors, nor did it increase debt directly.
“clients place objects they already own, and the monetaryization of personal assets does not increase household debt,” she said.
The pledge is gaining greater public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
However, the Lombards are not the only people in difficult financial circumstances.
The rich in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices to place gold bars or Rolex clocks, which can provide up to 60 per cent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy persons who need to borrow money for short periods for commercial projects or investments or small businesses that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of health facilities available and their status that are important for the population, but the quality of health care provided.
The implementation of the 2011-2013 programme “Renovation of health care in the Tulsk region”, the reorganization of our city's health facilities, will lead to the establishment of an optimal health-care structure for the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant women and mothers.
For example, once she had merged with the hospital, there was an even greater possibility of attracting narrow specialists from the GPW “NKB” to consult pregnant women with various pathologies and to carry out additional hospital-based examinations.
Since the modernization programme, the logistics base of the maternity home has been significantly improved and modern equipment has been developed to meet world standards.
Over the years, approximately 8 million roubles have been allocated for major maintenance of premises, and 112 items of equipment worth 42 million roubles have been purchased.
The most up-to-date equipment is equipped with an intensive bed for newborns.
The Cesarean Section uses the Sell-Sever machine to collect blood from an operating wound and to return it to the baby after special treatment, avoiding transfusions of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a department of laboratory and laboratory diagnostics.
The women's consultation has an electronic registration system, and electronic maps and patient history are planned for the near future.
The development of tele-health has made it possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, maternity and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and looted 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens are arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been under way since March this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes to one of the Strasbourg hotels and then beat and looted them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old woman who had previously been convicted of Chechnya.
David Alabama's Bavaria defender became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reports the official Bundesliga website.
In this dispute, he warned of winter sports, which have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second was the miner Marcel Herscher, and the third was the skier from Gregor Schlerenzauer.
During the last season, 21-year-old Austrians of Philippine-Nigerian origin helped their team win the champions' League, the championship and the German Cup, and the supercube of UEFA.
Arshavina's ex-wife is resting with actor Andrei Chadov
The former civilian wife of Peter’s “Senita” football player, Andrei Arshavina Yulia Baranovsky, is taking leave with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy with an actress named Anastasia Zareka, her groom, Sergey Slavov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
The co-execution photos are published in Instagram Anastasia Zarem.
This isn't the first joint picture of Andrey and Julia.
On October 5, Zareka published a picture of a couple holding their arms on the shores of the Gulf of Finn in Komarvo.
In mid-October, Andrei Arshabin admitted to living apart from his civilian wife, Julia.
Recall that Julia Baranovsky and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, having three children.
It's recently come to light that Arshavin is dating the ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Arshavin's new friend was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Rescue package of $325 million for Tasmanian health
The Federal Government insists that a rescue package of $325 million for a weakened Tasmanian health system will be supplemented by strict conditions which guarantee that the state Government will not waste any money.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plybersek, announced that the Commonwealth was taking “immediate measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the higher level of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system.
The decision to finance for a period of four years was taken following consultations with the Government and independent member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilki.
“The Government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we trust will address the specific problems facing the state,” stated Ms. Plybersek today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract disposal operations, will help to overcome the backlog.
There is also money available for unrecorded clinics in Hobart and Lonston to improve post-patient care, medical training, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical records in local hospitals.
“This investment will build on the ideas put forward by the leading doctors on how best to help Tasmanian health care,” said Ms. Plybersek.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian Government should operate under strict accountability and responsibility.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report on a monthly basis on the extent to which it spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the staff provides the services as efficiently and as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would not be resolved “unless it is followed by a genuine reform that would place Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable footing”.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for its response to his request for urgent assistance, which he had first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to the withdrawal of the state’s health system from critical condition,” said Mr. Wilki.
According to the state Government, these additional sampling procedures significantly offset recent reductions.
But Peter Dutton, the Federal Opposer for Health, believes that today's statement is “a solution similar to that of a Julyist”.
“The reason we're here is because the Labour Government of the state has pulled $430 million out of the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
When the state government takes away almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million dollars, it can't be pretended to be good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plebersek to guarantee that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracies.
The ecumenization of Guillaume Niklu's novel, Denis Didr, may boast of exceptional features and historical details, but it also feels harder than it should have been.
The film that takes place in France in the 1760s tells the grim story of Susanna, a young aristocratic who was sent to a monastery by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she is subjected to extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadistic woman and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to the point of travel or sensation — the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, reporting risks becoming a test for the audience as well.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing equipment, says the monitoring group.
Syria had destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munitions with toxic gas, declared the international monitoring group on Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near a facility where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian group of activists stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
Declaration of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons one day before
The deadline of 1 November, established by this Hague-based organization, to ensure that Damascus destroys or “employs” all chemical weapons and mechanisms to mix chemicals with the production of a poisonous gas and fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially an initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all of Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during the brutal fighting on Thursday in Safira, where experts believe the chemical weapons facility and its storage location are located, reports the British-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights.
A group of activists who tracked losses through a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the part of the Government, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-Government militants and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2,202 army fighters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
The United Nations estimates that 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought the rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of which are associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were both victims on Thursday but did not provide specific data.
The fighting highlighted the danger faced by the chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the short duration of their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied that it has verified and seen destroyed all critical means of production and mixing/fuels equipment declared by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two locations for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that both locations had been, according to Syria, “the chemical weapons programme items in them were abandoned and ... were moved to other declared sites that had been verified”.
It was not possible to ascertain immediately whether the Safira site was one of the two locations that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director-General of the monitoring group, Ahmet Uzumju, in a comment published by the OPCW.
For the third year, civil war has been confronted by rebels, mainly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad Government and its security forces, which are members of its Alavit sect, the branch of Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of the Rami Abdurrahman Centre said that there had been a severe explosion on Wednesday at an air force facility in the coastal province of Syria, Latakia.
The reason for the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger at the conviction of the organizers of the Bali terrorist attack
The remaining 202 dead and relatives of the Bali bomb in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators who had been tried and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years in the race as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in creating explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He may be released within 15 years if he is granted parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of massacres as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in a popular tourist region of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including the explosion of churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could have insisted that a person who had been called a “breaker” for his reputation as a master in the manufacture of explosive devices should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of a mother from Perth June courtin who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack by Patek and his associates nearly ten years ago.
She said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I must live every day knowing that I will have no grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was launched in a parked outside van immediately after 11 a.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and died three times, being connected to the life-support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the participation of three other members of the terrorist cell “Jemaah Islamia”, responsible for the massacre — Amrosi, Mukhlas and Imam Sakota — who had been executed four years earlier.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most.
There's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.
Patek is the last participant in the Bali attack to be tried.
He had been in hiding for almost a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where United States troops killed former Al-Qaida chief Usama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent showed that the intelligence evidence had been that Patek had been in Pakistan to meet with Ben Laden in an effort to re-establish links between the terrorist groups of South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
“He didn't give up," said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he had no regrets about how much grief he had caused others.
The sentence was handed down on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, to be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” said Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
FAH: "Audible passengers can now use flight guesses (but do not call from mobile phones) "
Air travelers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones — according to the long - awaited new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Authority on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect changes to take place immediately.
How fast such a change is going to take place will vary according to the airline, said FAU administrator Michael Wert at the press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAH how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and layout regulations to comply with the new guidelines.
FAH stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of laptop electronics in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
“According to the status of the plan, we could approve the increased use of electronic devices very soon,” stated FAH.
Passengers are now obliged to switch off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives them “good”.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is declining for landing and not include them until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected against electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, FAH stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Travellers, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to do so), it will be a win-win option,” said Glading.
We are genuinely tired of feeling “in school” when it comes to this issue.
But Internet connection for surfing, exchanging e - mails, text messages, or downloading data will still be banned at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, reported the agency.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aircraft mode.
Thus, there are still no words with friends — an intellectual Internet game in which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the accident occurred: the actor was removed from the American Airlines airline for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was on its way to the landing site.
More heavy devices, such as laptops, will still have to be placed in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
Mobile phone calls in flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission, rather than the FAH, has regulatory authority over telephone calls.
FAH may remove the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Council, National Transport Safety Expert CBS News, stated that cell phones were still considered a risk.
“Clean phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FAS that they can interfere with cellular communications when the plane is in the air,” said Rosenker.
The Industry Advisory Committee established by FAH to study this issue recommended last month that the Government allow for the increased use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, FAH has been under pressure to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics, such as the senator-democratic of Missouri Clare McCasquil, argue that there are no good security reasons for prohibitions.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAH began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers, high-tech guesses of the time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAH as being resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at the cruise height for several years.
Fixed-wing aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of the liners are equipped for the wider use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, Wert said.
Today ' s electronic devices usually emit radio signals much lower than previous generations of devices.
Devices to read e-books, for example, emit only minimal signals when the pages are crossed.
But the signals get stronger when the devices download or send data.
Among those seeking to reduce restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded an entire airliner with their Kindle e-book reader and flew to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAH Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Passengers stated that he considered the interference with the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only individual reports of pilots confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAH allow pilots to require passengers to disable the devices while landing on the instruments in limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes by calling them a healthy step towards the passengers, who are now using many technological devices.
“We are pleased that FAU recognizes that passengers’ comfort is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Dow, Director General of the US Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to conduct driving tests
A driver's license examination will be available to private companies with their own computerized automotive.
This is referred to by Commander with reference to the Government's draft Regulation “On the admission to drive”.
According to the paper, there are currently only about 30 such highways in Russia.
Students are expected to take into account the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Inspectorate will monitor the examination every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 per cent of the examinations in theory and more than 20 per cent of the courses do not pass on the first time, such a school will be denied six months ' privileges.
The technical requirements for road vehicles contained in the draft Government Regulation are in force as of 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training in the driving of two-wheeled equipment.
As of 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will be required to pass an urban examination to obtain category A rights.
Also, with effect from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers would have to obtain Russian rights after the examination.
A bird thrown by air into a safe place from a drilling plant in the North Sea was released back into the wild
After being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, the bird was released back into the wild.
The water shepherd was placed in a helicopter headed for Aberdeen last month and then left by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty (SPCA) at a rescue centre in Elia.
The director of the centre, Colin Ceddon, said, "This water-trap is most likely a winter migrant from northern Europe who has been caught in a strong wind zone over the North Sea."
It seems that the bird is exhausted and has been able to find shelter on an oil rig.
He added: "She was unable to fly again, so we were asked for help."
The water shepherd boy was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for British was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and determine what changes British wealth creators and jobs want to see in relations with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their views on Great Britain, business and EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of business in the UK by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will be surprising to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are now looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying special attention to countries that are upgrading and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than spending time on the long and difficult process of reforming the confused EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general complaint about the single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of regulation from Brussels were now higher than the benefits of being in Europe’s trading zone — even 40 per cent of the large enterprises traditionally pro-European from all companies.
Last and foremost, our survey of business leaders revealed that the clear majority wanted Britain to pursue a course of contract change and trade-based relations with the EU rather than policy.
This result, which was observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on “significant change”, which will return authority to Britain.
The rates are high: achieving a change in the contract and a more favourable environment for the United Kingdom will provide a 16 per cent shift in voting to remain with the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: the survey shows that British business supports his plan to review the conditions for British membership in the EU.
It also shows that business expects that the revision will result in a significant shift in the current balance of power back to the United Kingdom.
The best conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to employment and economic growth in Great Britain, and, as our survey shows, for business this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels ' s regulatory activities.
U.S. Specialist listens to Pope's personal phone
The activities of the Vatican are under the watchful control of the U.S. special services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that the U.S. intelligence was listening to all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now he's a close guardian of Pope Francis.
His phone began listening before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election of the new pope was also monitored.
What was of particular importance in the United States.
The special services connected to the cell phones of cardinals who met in Rome to select another pope.
There were also telephones from the residence where the participants lived.
The U.S. spies listened to all the top candidates on the Holy See to prevent Washington’s undesired figure.
Panorama says that the U.S. “bigger ear” continued to intercept prelate conversations until the end of the prelate on March 12.
It is alleged that the Argentine Archbishop Bergolio has been appointed as the future of Pope Rome since 2005 in the United States.
American intelligence also followed negotiations regarding the election of a new president of the Bank of the Vatican.
The Italian Journal reports that the U.S. Embassy of Rome continues to operate a secret team of CIA and NSA operatives collecting information on policies and financial flows.
The Vatican, for its part, has declared in peace that it does not care about the American “problem”, even if it does.
Holy fathers have no secrets from the U.S. leadership.
A snowboarder for the Olympian bill was specially photographed
The Bank of Russia issued on Wednesday aide-memoire on Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held during the winter.
The currency nominal is 100 rubles.
But bloggers on the web are already actively ironing about a memorable bank note.
Following the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they pointed out that the image of the banker could be found in the photographs.
In particular, in the free storage of the StockExchange photo, where the photograph is dated in 2005.
The same photograph is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobsor on 18 January 2011.
Also, it's already been used in RugGear smartphone advertising.
The Olympia note was implemented in the blue and blue gamma.
A snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the one hand, and an Olympic stadium and a Jar Bird, on the other.
The author of the note design was Pavel Bushhuev, who won a contest for students of the Repin Academy of Arts of St. Petersburg.
The presentation noted that several types of sports - mining, fritile, and spring - were considered, but they eventually selected a snowboard because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source “Izvestium”, close to the CB, the regulator does not care about the public opinion regarding the widespread distribution of the image of the snowboarder from the Olympic bank notes and is currently studying the situation.
In Gonak, however, there is little concern about the noise around the Olympic bank notes.
The head of the press service, Mr. Natalia Nikiforov, said that all the discussions about plagiarism were ridiculous.
A billboarder on a banknote will turn to the right, photos on the network to the left, specifying Nikiforov.
The man on the photo session to create the bill was taken from different points, and then the final image was selected, and he's a feature outside the snowboarder.
She also noted that the copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic bank note because the artist was paid for his work.
In the view of the experts, the discussion on the Olympic bill image is very positive.
The recognizability of the image on the bill, plus for its promotion, is considered by Alexei Popović, Executive Director of the RusBrend.
It is difficult to prove 100 per cent similarity between the pictures on the bill and in the photographs, so claims against intellectual property are unlikely to be made.
For the first time, the Olympic note appeared in China - a 10 Yuan aide-memoire was released for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
According to their assumptions, the consumption of beer in the country will remain at the same level next year, at best.
Even though businessmen were initially counting on growth.
The current year is a bad one for them: sales fell by 7 per cent.
This was reported by the head of one of the country's largest beer companies and the President of the Council of the Union of Russian Beers, Isaac Scheps, at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute, “The goods of daily demand in Russia”, which had just ended in Moscow.
It discussed market government regulation.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market had already fallen 18 per cent, as there had been a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in recent years with regard to the production and trafficking of low alcohol beer, which she had reported to the audience.
No country in the world has so severely restricted the beer market, nor has there been any unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions, which are allegedly justified by the fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer visited that many of the legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing alcohol abuse had little impact, but new initiatives were constantly emerging.
The ban on the sale of alcohol in kiosks has been the most painful for beer producers since this year.
"We immediately lost 35,000 consumers," said Isaac Shepp.
The brewers have two predictions for next year.
Optimist is the one Shep's been talking about: The sale of the foam will continue at the same level.
The pessimist will fall by another 2-3%.
In order to preserve their profits, businessmen have to move away from the bulk-consumer classes to the “premium” class: beer will be less expensive but it will be more expensive.
In the meantime, the radical effects of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet apparent.
"In my observations, the level of alcoholism remains at about the same level," said Dr. Alexei Sotnikov.
True, there has been an increase in the proportion of patients who use hard drinks, as well as those who “scatter” on alcohol-containing tonics such as “Yaguar”, while over a decade have been dominated by “drinking” alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were fired from Ford's car plant in the city.
According to the trade unions, all those dismissed received compensation.
However, much more acute than the problems of workers is the question of reducing production in the region.
A member of the Zachsa district office, Alexei Ethmanov, stated at the meeting that some 600 people had been cut off at the Ford factory in Allvologsk.
According to him, this occurred in September, when about 600 people left the factory under a voluntary dismissal programme that had been developed with the organization's trade union.
A “golden parachutes” of several salaries were offered to workers who had chosen to quit.
As a result, the vast majority have left their jobs of their own free will.
But according to Ethmanov, that number of people is a night shift.
I don't think that's going to be the case.
However, the authorities did not plan to adopt any support programmes for regional enterprises in difficult situations in the next two years,” he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region or the significant reduction of jobs in the adoption of the budget.
This information is neither refuted nor corroborated in Ford.
We're waiting for the company's response, and as soon as it appears, we'll have to publish it.
Discussions about the reduction of workers at the Ford factory in All-Whitesk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the plans of the company to dismiss 600 people had become known as early as September.
The plant had previously declared the suspension of car production.
The fall in demand for Russia's Ford vehicles was cited as a reason in the factory.
According to Petrostat, industrial production in Lenoblasta declined by 5.4 per cent as a result of nine months in 2013.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile aircraft will be available during take-off and landing
The new regulations for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of aircraft were approved in the United States and reported to BBC.
United States airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and the new regulations will be in force by the end of 2013.
However, Internet connection for receiving and sending e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
In view of the danger of interference with aircraft ' s radio equipment, cellular voice services will continue to be banned.
Thus, airline passengers are allowed to read e-books, play tablets and other games and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before regulations are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of electronic devices during flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the perceived impact of mobile aircraft equipment and aircraft control devices.
According to a source such as the U.S., current usage of electronic devices in flight may also be reviewed in Britain.
The Russian Mafia in the United States has finally established a new name, the Brate Circle.
This week the black list of the "Russian Mafia" in America has been filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two Uzbeks and an Israeli into the “Bratsk Circle”.
One of the Russians was a famous singer named Gregory Leps, suspected by the United States of America of transporting money to the group.
A total of 22 persons involved in the “Brata Circle” and six associated organizations are on the U.S. blacklist.
Nevertheless, many experts doubt that such an organization exists.
"The statement about the "Brate Circle" is more like an attempt to unite dispersed criminal groups," said Mark Galeotty, an expert on organized crime and professor at the University of New York.
In his view, the “Bratsky Circle” reflected the popular perception of the “Russian Mafia”.
“I have met no one in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization”, quotes Mr. Galeotty as the United States Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Professor George Mason Liz Shelly of the University also agreed with Mr. Galeotty.
“If they act together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization”, the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime points out.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotty suggested that the "Brate Circle" is a more close Russian enemy in Aslan Usoyan's law, known as Father Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zacharia Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Father Hassan, and another participant in the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew.
Nevertheless, he noted that some individuals were not relevant to Usoyan.
In his view, all of them had rather shared common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Gregory Leps, Russian President Vladimir Putin's favorite singer, in the "Brat circle" drew the attention of the Kremlin.
Of course, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, so it was decided why he was placed on such lists,” said the head of State's spokesman, Dimitri Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Like all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.
Head Gazprom Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The start of the construction of the South Flow gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launching of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
“Today, a landmark event has taken place: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the gas pipeline South Flow, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Flow is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute under the contract between Gazprom and his partners in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas destined for Europe is located, increases the level of risk for conventional routes, says officials.
Miller stated that direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks posed by transit countries had been eliminated “always”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Flow at a lower price as soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gasprom stated that construction should begin in other countries further along the gas pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
In the Sarata area this morning, the driver of the Péugeot car went to the front lane, 115 kilometres of the Odessa-Reni route, and ran into a bus carrying six people.
This is reported by the PPP Press Service in Odessa.
The accident killed a 31-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were injured.
The medical staff provided the woman with the first medical treatment on the spot, and she refused hospitalization.
Medical ambulances also examined all other passengers.
Cone rescuers picked up the bus and released the driver of the bus whose leg had been held at the door of the bus.

The police arrested a gunman at Los Angeles Airport
The police arrested the suspect in the shooting at Los Angeles Airport.
It was previously reported that a rifle fire had been opened in one of the airport terminals.
The police and rescue services evacuated people from the building.
The perpetrator was wounded in a shooting incident with the police, no information about his identity.
The police are looking for his possible accomplices.
It is believed that several people were injured during the exchange of fire.
It is noted that Barack Obama was informed of the incident.
Two YMCA officers were charged with sexual offences even before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as became known to the Royal Commission
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with sexual offences against children prior to the 2011 charges against a child-care agency in Karingbach, Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
But in the Commission's opening statement, it was stated that it had “never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director, Philippe Hayra, was asked about one case in which YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and another in which YMCA sports instructor Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayr told Gail Fernness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he was aware of the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA in its opening speech to the commission had also been imprecise, claiming that “the YMCA external checks had been carried out, recognizing that YMCA was at the forefront of children's security”.
The evidence provided to the commissions indicates that YMCA was notified that it had received the second out of four possible quality audits conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hayr, who joined YMCA at the age of 21, acknowledged that he and the senior management had failed in hiring Lord and had failed to ensure a clear understanding among staff of their obligations to report violations of child security policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years in YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayr rejected the assumption that YMCA ' s corporate ethics prevented staff from reporting violations of Lord ' s security of children.
The officers testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord had been alone with the children, had taken care of them personally, had taken care of them on his knees, had told them that he loved one of them and had allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was led by the Lord and asked for training in the protection of her children because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she had found Jackie Barnat, YMCA ' s custody manager in Karingbach, who was Lord ' s leader, "very frightening and often difficult to access."
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the staff ' s explanation that it was awkward for them to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said that their friendship with their Lord kept them from thinking of the need to report him.
Mr. Hayr said that he had presented to the YMCA Council of New South Wales his view that the lesson for an organization from “the incident with Jonathan Lord” did not “affected the provision of information” by staff members and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hayr stated that the decision to force staff members to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges were made was taken by the Director General of YMCA for the custody of children, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent the deterioration of evidence, but that the decision had been “overdoing” and had been poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during the 2009-2011 period, and was informed by a child corruption expert from the University of Griffith, Professor Stephen Smolbone.
He said that there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, selection, guidance, training and monitoring of staff.
Hearings postponed until 20 December.
Fashion Week in São Paulo.
She's a real star, not just a dummy.
Despite the fact that Giselle Bundschên had left her job for a while and had been distracted by motherhood, on those days and by this week she had arrived on purpose.
For months, her absence did not prevent her from keeping her seat on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the most highly paid supermodel in the world.
This time, she was involved in the Kolcchi defil.
The final week of fashion is usually the most interesting show.
It's like what Lino Willaventura organized.
Marke, for more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of the pret-a-port of the Lux class, works actively in the theater and in the cinema, making performances and making costumes for many famous paintings.
A total of more than 30,000 firms and companies involved in the textiles and fashion worlds participated in the concluding week of fashion in São Paulo.
This is one of the most dynamic areas of production, and it employs more than 2 million Brazilians, and it's 50 billion dollars a year.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance of returning as British Prime Minister, but admitted that return was unlikely.
On the eve of the 5th anniversary interview, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after 10 years as leader, Blair has largely avoided British policy discussions, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as an ambassador in the Quartet to Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked if he would have returned to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: “Yes, of course, but it's not likely to happen, so ...”
The chief coach, Milana, Massiliano Allegri, regretted nothing at the 10th Italian championship game with Lacio.
The expert also noted that the failure at the start was due to a series of injuries to the leading players.
I'm sorry we didn't win, because Tmw says Allegry.
The team played a good game, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half of the time, we didn't allow anything to happen to Lacio.
The second Romans added, but I can't say in general that we've lost our concentration.
We had to win.
In the last season, we met the challenge of getting into the Champion League.
Now we're behind schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries to key football players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
But our composition is still good.
Look at Kaka, who had a high-level meeting.
Experts from the confrontational events that came to Cardiff to fight for the award of the Year knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for Fenton Kirkland, age three.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months earlier who had taken his first steps, this young man and his pet, the Shetland pony, Toffie, rolled through three tours to easily take the prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple — of equal height — received high grades for the appearance, conduct and style of the annual competition held by the Sunnibank Mounting Center in Radri, near Cardiff.
Going on a general view of the male and female background in fine hats, he moved his cap around and proudly walked around Toffi for two years.
The judges commended Fenton for his years - old innate ability to handle horses.
Toffie got the highest rating for appearance and character.
The Fenton was given to Toffy on his third birthday last March, and since then he's been working with the Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffee are beautiful duets."
They had many rivals, but these two left with a golden cup and a locomotive.
It was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Strange people in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Weil in South Wales, is following the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been carrying horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “The whole audience was struck, and everyone shouted and laughed.”
He ran through the sand all the way across the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his job perfectly.
Fenton loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens that he cares about.
From the way he started, he would soon be taking part in the Loshadi of the Year — and I'm sure he'll be doing well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibition said: “The Fanton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
They're a great team together.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and their presentation at the show market.
They appreciate the coherence between the pony and the manufacturer - Fenton and Toffie were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive dress, and he was really good at his role.
The Chinese newspaper “to be reorganized” has issued a call.
The Chinese newspaper, which published a front-line call for the release of the accused in the slander of the reporter, must be reorganized and reported to the press controller.
The Guangzhou newspaper New Express made an unexpected public statement asking for the release of a journalist, Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with state ownership.
The New Express now has to go through a “full error correction process”, as the regulator reports.
The Guangdun Office of the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television has issued an order to “correcte mistakes”.
The preliminary investigation found that Young News Group published several false reports about Zoomlion's registered company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express Guide has been disoriented,” says the regulator's statement.
He states that it has been decided “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a withdrawal of his reporter's licence”.
He also “commanded Young News Group to make a full correction of the New Express's errors and recommended that it investigate the newspaper's situation and immediately amend the management of the New Express”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express in which he claimed financial irregularities in a construction company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front line, stating that it supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State television, confessing that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the whole news media industry and its public confidence,” he said to the State broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Cheng's confessions, the New Express published an apology on the front line, stating that the newspaper had failed to check his reports properly.
A number of high-ranking suspects recently made confessions on television.
The experts said that the practice of beating confessions in China was still widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from coercing anyone.
A U.S. tunnel has been found — Mexico for the transport of drugs equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex drug-smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been found with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel four by three feet wide as one of the most complex secret moves ever discovered.
The tunnel, which has a length of almost six football fields, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with impenetrable warehouses, which facilitate the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs, as stated by the authorities, could be transported invisibly through it.
According to court documents, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine were confiscated by law enforcement personnel when a tunnel was discovered.
Three men who were said to be drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they would be sentenced to 10 years ' imprisonment to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel represents the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels have been discovered in Central Mexico since the harvest of marijuana in October, which has made it difficult for drug cartels to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of approximately 700 yards, equipped with rail lines, from a kitchen in Tijuana to two san Diego warehouses.
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November of this year, and the correspondent of BELT has been informed by the General Directorate of Pensions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
With effect from 1 November this year, adjustments will be made to the average wage of employees in the Republic applied in the previous recosting of pensions with an increase of 5.4 per cent and the corresponding recalculation of employment pensions in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on increases in pensions.
As a result of the recalculation of employment pensions from November onwards, it is estimated that the average age pension will increase by 5.3 per cent.
The average old-age pension would be Br2 million, 295,000.
The increase in pensions affects 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection on higher pensions from November of this year will be increased by Br274.3 billion per month.
Simultaneous with the recalculation of labour pensions in November of this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be recalculated as the average subsistence budget increases per capita.
BPMs for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 were approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million, 530 million, 2.1 per cent higher than in force from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the minimum pensions, social pensions and allowances, promotions and pension supplements will be increased by 2.1 per cent with effect from 1 November.
In Belarus, over Br53 trillion-0 per cent of the increase in 2013
British police give Assange notice of extradition
Today, the British police gave a notification of the extradition of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian “official demand to surrender” to the police station, adding that if he failed to comply with that requirement, he would be further arrested.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his opportunities under British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer it to the United States, on 19 June he took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, requesting political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland Yard “offered to a 40-year-old man an official requirement to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at a police station day and time of our choice”, as the Spokesperson reported.
It continues to violate bail conditions.
The Embassy refused to comment on the presentation of the notification to the police.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible charges of espionage following the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic dispatches on the counter-secretity website of WikiLeaks.
A driver driving at 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs is fined 1 000
The motorist was fined 1 000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptri, Essex, was observed driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 route in Breintri on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take him out between his legs.
In the world court, Colchester Howie admitted the charge of driving without due diligence and consideration.
The addition of seven fines to his driving licence resulted in his six-month ban on driving.
Houi has also committed itself to paying costs of $90 and an additional fee to assist victims of crime in the amount of £100.
A tax for foreign real estate owners will cause the London bubble to burst
The Treasury carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital increase tax, but looked forward to a final decision from Mr. Osborn, who, in the 2012 budget, had imposed a 7 per cent public duty on homes valued at more than 2 million and an annual payment to buyers who decided to own homes in partnership rather than as individuals.
To date, the State housing duty in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas, which was 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 financial year, has already exceeded the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook stated: “After the increase of the duty on expensive houses and the introduction of related legislation against the evasion, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is understated regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this step may lead some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of the first-class real estate, the top 5 to 10% of the housing market, in the rich south-west of London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady annual increase of 5.6 per cent, but they were overshadowed by an active “father's market” with rising prices in south-west, north-west and east-east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists shed light on the way in which the dog’s tail moves are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs wag their tail in the right (from the dog's point of view), while alarmed dogs wave their tail mostly in the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can observe and respond to these subtle differences in tailing.
Professor Giorgio Wallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that people of the left and right brain have different roles in shaping motivations that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we've tried to look at it from other species.
He added that, just like a human, dogs have the right side of their brain to control the left side of their body and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in their emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the various waves of other dogs ’ tails, researchers observed animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analysed their behavior.
Perhaps we will soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way or the other.
Professor Wallortigara said, "We showed dogs a video of dogs -- either naturalistic versions or silhouettes -- to get rid of any other distortions, and we could manipulate the tail motion and direct the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw that nothing else in the rest of the dog moved its tail to the right (from the point of view of a swirling dog’s tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was mostly to the left (again from the point of view of a plumbing dog’s tail), their heart rate was increasing and they looked anxious.
Professor Wallortygara said he didn't think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience of what movements they should be concerned about and what they should not worry about.
He observes: “If there are several encounters with other dogs and their tail is often one way or another associated with more friendly behavior and the right side gives less friendly behaviour, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a better understanding of their animal emotions.
An expert on dog behavior, John Bradshaw, an invited scientist at the Bristol University Veterinary School, said that this was not the first study to test whether dogs were relevant to the left and right side.
Last year a team of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog and to the right if they look at a satisfied dog.
In another study at Victoria University in Canada, he said: “The dogs were more likely to approach the robot dog when its tail was pointed to the left than to the right, instead of becoming anxious, the opposite of Italian research”.
He said that the difference might be because dogs in various studies did not fully understand animals in films or robots as dogs.
A useful study of how dogs react to real dogs, he explained, might be helpful.
“While there is sufficient evidence for various mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details remain to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their conduct can be recorded, we may soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way or the other.
Archaic Monkeys is laying a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock band postponed a concert in Glasgow after her vulcanist had been diagnosed with laringitis.
This Chieffield team was supposed to be performing at Hydro's town show on Friday.
However, Alex Turner's disease forced them to move the show.
This statement was made by the group after it was forced to postpone the concert to LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys reported: “After the decision to move the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after the medical service request, Arctic Monkeys should also be postponed at Hydro Square in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November”.
“Alexa Turner was diagnosed with laringit”, and unfortunately he was unable to speak.”
The LG Arena show in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, and the Glasgow show at Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All the tickets to the show remain valid.
We want to apologize to all the owners of the tickets for any inconvenience that this has caused them.
To obtain any additional assistance, please contact the client service department of the ticket account where you have purchased your tickets.
Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February.
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his ministry on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the choice of his successor.
There are 201 cardinals.
After reaching the age of 80, however, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope — the prerogative of a group of 120 “votes”.
In announcing this news item, the Vatican Spokesperson, Federico Lombardi, said that a gathering of all current cardinals, known as the Consistorate, would be held prior to the ceremony.
“Paper Francis decided to inform in advance of his decision to convene a confrontation in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from around the world,” said Lombardy.
Jack Valero, of Catholic Voices, said that by February, the number of electorate cardinals was likely to drop.
He said that the pope usually called as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of electoral cardinals back to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over 80 years of age as he wished.
The Consistorate will be important next year because it will be the first ever since Francis was elected in March of this year, according to Valero.
At this point there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favour of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first to be elected cardinals since the formation of the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, whose task it is to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad made decisions on his own.
“Now Francis has selected eight cardinals to help him,” said Valero.
He said that “it is possible” that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we were not in that situation before — for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually the cardinal of bishops from large parishes, but Francis “a field of surprises — so we don't know who he's going to call. ”
GM withdraws a number of new U.S. pick-up pick-ups for seat backs
General Motors Co withdraws almost 19,000 completely new Chevrolet Silver and GMC Sierra model of 2014 to address manual seat back adjustment issues, in accordance with a Friday notification from U.S. regulators on vehicle safety.
On some peaks, front seats may have a back inclination defect.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal safety standards for head restraints.
“When a car is hit from the rear, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers by increasing the risk of injury”, states a notification posted on the website of the National Road Safety Authority.
The models referred to have been manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The production of GM pick-ups began in June and is the most important launch of the vehicle into serial production for a leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM reported a defect to pick-up truck owners in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider notification to the owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the growth of car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pick-ups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as stated by GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Siera pickups.
The GM stock at the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday day to a record of $37.47.
Obama’s Cry for Despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for change
He said that Obama had made it possible for the Republicans to be obstructed by commendable efforts.
Overcrowding cannot justify problems with the website of Obama ' s reformed health system, the attack on drones
The Obama campaign memoirs 2008 are a sad reminder of what could be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard University Medical School.
I've been reading a terrible book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me during my depression in the second year of the medical department and give me a sense of hope.
It's called "Victory for Victory" and it's memoirs about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing my report on my patients tonight and I go to bed, this book brings me back at a time when politics inspired millions of people, and speeches could take a breath.
The election victory was impressive, and leading news programmes paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents protected all the newspapers they could find.
The White House was to be visited by a young team of strategyaries, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama ' s assumption of office in 2008, his level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
Returning is indeed a gross awakening, like taking away from a dream.
Those days of optimism are hard to remember — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years since I dropped my first ballot paper, changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the repeal of the rule of “Don't ask, don't say”, to the killing of Usama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of public health choices and the closure of Guantánamo base among others.
But after countless times I appeared on the side of Obama's administration defending her in front of my colleagues and peers, I ran out of explanations that I could give.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The obstruction of the Republicans cannot explain the permission of foreign leaders or the targeting of innocent children in other countries by drones.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the privacy of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of detectors who expose the Government ' s misconduct.
He could not explain the killing of American citizen Anwar Al-Avlaka without trial or investigation or the non-compliance with the limits of State funding and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of a report stating that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are “the most aggressive... since Nixon's administration”.
In recent times, it has been unable to justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable medical care.
I don't know if I should have expected it.
Did I have to understand, at the age of 18, that leadership might be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it?
Clearly, the election is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by the opposition political party and by random events such as the invasion of Newton.
Nevertheless, in all of the examples I have mentioned above, they were largely their own choice of administration.
And that's what bothers me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidature.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I assumed that Obama's second term, free of the pressure of future elections, would meet the expectations we had heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama ' s rating dropped below 45 per cent this week, returning through this book in 2008 became much more difficult.
This makes me puke on many promises that have gone away.
This week I read the part of the book that describes Clinton's deafening defeat of Obama in the primary election in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting to analyse the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they must return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
“I want us to return our appeal,” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in the commentary are solely from Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave.
A billion-year-old official, Clive Palmer, says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnate, which has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made this statement at a time when it was trying to get away from the question of whether it has a conflict.
The Palmer Joint Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding to abolish carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be held by ministers and said that Mr. Abbas' daughters would personally benefit from political action.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters become pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they will receive leave or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the battle for the seat of the Ferfax electoral district from Sanshain Cost.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the voting procedure in order to speed up the process.
Tony Abbot's daughters Francis and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be made two months after we voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why don't we have a system that we can come in, put our data on the computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 6:30 p.m. the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
It seems strange to use pencils today.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibilities for electronic voting and recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
The 59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sanshain-Costa and he would “very seriously” take his new work.
Public office involves service to society.
“We do not seek any rewards other than thanks to history for serving this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders in its currency unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is further evidence that global controls of alleged currency manipulations are rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations of the world's largest financial market, with daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS officers to be excluded during the unfolding investigation, which is attributable to a scandal related to the manipulation of the LIBOR interbank rate.
By refusing to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation of this issue is ongoing, and we are cooperating fully with FCA and our other regulators,” reported the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, knowledgeable persons said that RBS had transmitted e-mail and instant messages received and sent by its former trader to the British regulatory body, the Financial Control Office (FAA).
The trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as is known, was granted leave in his current position as head of European spot exchange in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the leader of European shopping in Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was suspended from his job by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher ' s Instant Communications Group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to knowledgeable persons.
UBS reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after a Swiss regulator, Finma, said that it was investigating alleged currency manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies in the world — the European Commission, Finma, the competition authority of Switzerland Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have conspired to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, who were familiar with the situation.
Banks are looking for instant messages and e-mails within a few years to search for offences.
The news of the verifications has given rise to traders in the field of activity, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of income for the trading units of investment banks, which this year, however, has been difficult because the low volatility of currencies has reduced opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the gravity of the situation by saying that an extensive and highly liquid exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always the case.
According to the senior trader, despite the enormous volume of daily exchange on the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increased use of internal platforms by banks means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very low price”.
This news came on the same day when the Bank of Credit Suisse announced that he had fired one of the traders of his London Stock Exchange Trade Division this week, after he had suffered losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the authorities concerned and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are sure that the trader acted alone and that this issue has been localized,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court upheld the Obama Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled today that Barack Obama's landmark health law is constitutional, a major victory for Obama's administration.
By voting 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the Patient Protection and Public Health Act requiring citizens to obtain medical insurance prior to 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional, in accordance with the Government's tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Skalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law and further held that the requirement of the Health Care Act for states to improve compliance with the Medicalaid programme, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for the Medicalaid programme, is not unconstitutionally binding.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business have filed an action to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of the discord?
In the State, within the framework of the Open rostrum, politicians and experts talked about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the suggestions was the prohibition of football in the North Caucasus, because it is a game of scandals and discords.
Speaker Sergei Narishkin recalled recent events in Birülev and said that in order to reduce “the level of tension in society”, politicians and the media should be adjusted to speak.
He was probably referring to a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinowski, who, on one of his television programmes, threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they didn't want to limit fertility...
All speakers spoke of measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and of measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which gave rise to confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Birülev were "a model conflict that could be predicted," but "we have too many people and institutions to answer for these questions," and seven children without eyes.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe had long practiced against migrants, he said, had failed, and it was necessary to find a way.
Historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes in a new single history book.
“There is still a need to create a handbook on the history of the culture of the people of the country, so that school students in Tatar know that they live for people in Dagestan and vice versa,” he said.
Hennadiy Zuganov proposed criminalizing "the call to dismember Russia": "If you say on the U.S. radio that Alaska should be given to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zyrinowski was very careful not to inflame.
As usual, he accused journalists who bring sick and acute national problems into the public debate: “There is little to say in the dust of the debate.”
The leader of the "One Russia" faction, Vladimir Vasiliev, immediately advised journalists to conclude the Charter and agree to speak carefully on the subject, and then the same obligations can be assumed by politicians.
We have adopted some 30 laws that regulate migration, and order is generally established, Mr. Vasiliev stated.
He cited as an example a law that held regional and municipal authorities responsible for international peace in their territories.
But Sophia Andrichenko was not pleased with this law: it does not “see clearly what the adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and its limits are.
The scope of these powers will therefore be treated differently by the actors.
And the municipalities don't have the staff to deal with these complex issues, they don't have the resources, and the policy advice they can use doesn't give them...
The Head of the Duma Nationalities Committee, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special agency with a formidable name, the Ministry of National Security, to deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who led a similar agency in the 1990s, which was subsequently abolished, objected.
It would suffice to have a special person at the federal level, a “secretary without a portfolio”, to whom one could turn, if any.
"We walk around the country, the projectiles are blown by the side, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic and religious groups to work together against provocations, and this work should be supported with dignity of information," said the representative of the RC on relations with the community of Vivold Chaplin.
No State neutrality in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religion, should, in his view, be necessary.
Oleg Neil led the discussion into an unexpected direction: “More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan still need to be looked for, but they are being pushed on the wrong path, the wrong road,” he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The football players beat the whole crowd, the flags burn, the comrades stone each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another kind of sport - the rugby is called...
"They won't be the same in the world in this sport!"
There will be no one playing in the Caucasian rugby! Mr. Zyrinowski immediately intervened.
You'll give them another driver!
We need to know the national particulars, it's like Georgia's "Zapolyc" offer...
In Yaroslavl, wild behaviour in the rostrums was marked by the Moscow Club, during a game with a local club.
Football will have to be banned throughout the country...
Arthur Grigoryantz, head of the RFS supervisory committee, stated that Cubane was fined 500,000 roubles and handed over Philippe PAPENKOV's correspondent from the House of Football.
Such sanctions against the Red-Dar club were applied to set fire to the flag of Dagestan by the fans at the rostrum during the 14th Tour home game against Angie.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the RPFL.
We have examined all available materials.
The Cuban audience's misconduct is fined 500,000 roubles.
Nortel patent claims against Google companies, Samsung, Huawei
The Panel, which owns thousands of former Northel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, whose price it lost at the Nortel Bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion of Northel patents, filed claims with the US District Court in Texas v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to compare Internet search keywords with their respective ads, which are the basis for Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones using the Android operating system from Google, which is fiercely competing with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google offered $9,000 million in original patents.
Google raised the price several times, eventually offering an entire $4.4 billion.
In the case of the Norel Consortium of Rockstar patents, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partly determined by the Motorola patent library.
“Despite the unsuccessful attempt to obtain patents at the auction that are the subject of the claim, Google has violated and continues to violate them”, states the lawsuit.
Rockstar requires increased compensation for losses from Google because it claims that the violation of Google patent rights is deliberate, according to the claim.
In Egypt, the First Freely Elected President takes his oath
Mohammed Murcy is sworn in, but his day of celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Morsey promised “new Egypt” when he took an oath, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes in a court building on the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic”, said Murcy during a solemn ceremony shown live on State television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life of absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Murcy, a 60-year-old American-based engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which, for the most part of its 84 years, was banned by an organization that has been the target of violent actions by successive Governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Murcy arrived with a small motor vehicle shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike Mubarak’s presidential pump, the movement was stopped for only a short time to pass his convoy on a usually revived road connecting the centre of the city to the southern suburbs.
Although Mursey was ridiculed as a non-harmist spare wheel of the Brothers, his personal prestige has risen dramatically since his victory and his Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists but also for all those who want to complete the 2011 rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Mursey, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges wearing the wooden panels of the hall, where he took the oath.
Morsey later went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to deliver his inauguration speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that performed a state anthem, during which he stood on the stand “smartly”.
There was a military official, Feldmarshal Hussein Tantavi.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Army and the People — One Hand”, which had scandalized hundreds of those gathered in the main lecture room of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a reference to secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became the bedrock of Islamic student groups.
Mursey took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where the rebellion that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year began, and promised to regain the presidency's power, whose office was deposed by the military council, which took action from a deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before a court and not before Parliament, as is customary, it does the will of the military, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursey’s talk on Tahrir Square was filled with theater populist gestures.
A regular session of the Tumen Region Engineering Association was held at the Yalutorov Automotive Plant.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of steel electric welds was presented.
A marketing study on the market for steel structures in the Tumen region was carried out in 2011 with the arrival of the new owner, as told by the business director, Denise Gribanov.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric welds per month.
This was followed by a decision to modify the factory profile and the installation of equipment to produce them.
More than 7,000 tons of products have been shipped this year.
The investment in the factory was over 120 million roubles, as Denis Gribanov explained.
In October, a new state was launched, allowing for an increase in the range.
The factory produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for the private economy, small forms of construction and the furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
The target is 50,000 tons of production per year, which will amount to about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tuman region.
Despite the transition to other activities, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now 157, plans for the purchase of new equipment - by more than 50 additional staff.
The enterprise is being retrained and the necessary expertise is being selected from existing ones.
Next year, a new longitudinal sharpness unit is planned to become 5 millimetres thick, which will reduce the cost of products, as well as another condition, at the speed of pipe production to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the enterprise is planning to develop pipes that are used in housing and utilities.
The management of the enterprise aims to close up to 70 per cent of the Tümen region ' s demand for these products.
Leonid Ostroumov, Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, suggested that greater attention be paid to the modernization of engineering enterprises.
This is also reflected in forms of State support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its lease.
This year, 150 million roubles are allocated for this purpose, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The latter commission, which would consider grant contracts, would receive documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget covers the cost of participation of local producers in international fairs.
In the coming year, the budget provides for 150 million roubles, which can be used to offset lease payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
Five million will be allocated for participation in fairs, and three million for energy conservation programmes.
To 72 million roubles are being reduced for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is being produced in the southern Tumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, this form of support will end in the long run, as the reason for its introduction was compensation for the mining tax that oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
Accordingly, the Government of the region has given priority to direct support for industrial enterprises rather than financing the oil industry through them.
The assistance of the budget will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the current situation with oil companies.
The grant for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage for the southern Tumen region industry and, if it is abolished, it will be difficult to compete at a price with the middle strip of Russia, where the labour force is cheaper.
In addition, the continuity of the new owner of the TNC-XB, the Rosneoft, which has not yet placed its orders in the Tumen enterprises is unclear.
Agreement for the implementation of the Uwata Project expires in 2013 and no applications for extension were received.
At present, enterprises in the southern region that specialize in oil and gas equipment cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
It remains open whether taxes will be received from oil from the Uvat region to the budget of the region or whether they will be paid at the location where the new owner of the deposit will be registered.
Tomić will be working 240 hours for an extremist show on the social media.
The Leninsky District Court of Tomska sentenced 240 hours of compulsory work by a city resident who posted an extremist video on the social network, informed RIA Novosti on Friday by a representative of the Regional Court ' s press service.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page on a popular social network on the federal list of extremists.
A criminal case was brought against him under article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, “Actions aimed at inciting hatred and hostility, as well as the humiliation of human dignity, committed in public”.
“The Lenin Regional Court tried the case in a special way and found the man guilty of the above offence by imposing a penalty of 240 hours of compulsory work”, said the Agency's interlocutor.
She added that the man fully confessed his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians the collapse of commodity prices after the signing of the association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolay Azarov, is convinced that prices in the country will decline significantly after the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
That's what he said during his Facebook chat with his readers.
I can certainly say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, with the signing of the Agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area provision, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
This would mean that prices should go down.
“It's about goods coming from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other products, the impact of the agreement on prices would not be so direct, it would be indirect.
However, there should be no increase in prices either.
Therefore, reports on billboards, which have recently appeared quite widely in our country, that an association with the EU is an increase in prices, it is not quite true, or more precisely, it is not true,” summarized Azarov.
Investigators verify information about child abuse in Biisk
On 29 October, the media published a report that a nurse at a kindergarten in Biska had locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
Investigators are currently investigating all the circumstances, as well as providing a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten staff.
After being accused of being stupid, Evgenius Vasiliev spoke up.
Evgeni Vasiliev, who has received close attention from the media for nearly a year, has so far never commented on numerous publications in the press on both the thefts in the Ministry of Defense and on her personal relations with the ex-Minister of Defence, Anatoliy Heartyukov, her poetry and her addiction to valuable things.
On 1 November, however, the protagonist for the “Defence Service” case violated her silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasiliev, he said: “The challenge was, of course, one thing: to extract any negative information from me about the former Minister of Defence.”
There was a blackmail to tell me I had to testify, or I'd be put in prison.
To date, these threats have ceased.
We'll go to court, prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure of victory.
The interview concluded, however, that perhaps the most important thing was to say that she did not have a taste.
This is probably the case with a statement by the official representative of the UK of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that a falsification was found in the collection of paintings collected by the figure in the Defence Service case.
Among the property seized are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident of her deep knowledge of the art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the artistic expertise appointed by the investigators after the arrest of the paintings found that they had no artistic value and were simply cheap counterfeits,” said Markin in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
And then they admitted that they weren't stolen from the Ministry of Defense, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal thing?
I think it's just a mess," says Vasiliev.
On the question of whether she confessed to any of the 12 criminal incidents against her, Vasiliev stated: “No, of course not.
There's nothing to recognize.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the PKK that Vasiliev was not studying the criminal case file, counsel stated that he and his client “are prevented from getting to know the case file”.
What led to the discovery of the house arrest of Vasileva, who had not yet communicated with the press?
How could a woman fail to respond to an accusation of bad taste?
Or was it the right of the journalists of the Commmolki to claim, a couple of days ago, that she "fell into an even larger trance under house arrest" because of news of the reconciliation of Anatoliy Cardewova with his wife and his return to the family?
Víctor Barantec, a prominent military observer of KP, wrote in his article “Sardukov returned to his wife?”
Previously, Vasiliev had been charged with illegal sale of property from the Ministry of Defence.
Preconceived trouble.
What to Do in the Garden Before the Refrigeration Begins
From the fungicides in autumn, it is best to select copper-containing medicines, such as 1% of the Bordeaux mixture or those of Abiga-Pic, Oxyh, Ordan and others.
You think the tourists are gone because of the Internet?
The Flight Center seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its forecast of full-year profits and is looking forward to record revenues from vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The tourism firm now expects that its main full annual revenue before taxation will range from $325 million to $340 million, compared with a previous forecast ranging from $305 million to $315 million.
If current targets were met, this would represent a 12-17 per cent increase over the record revenue of $290.4 million in 2011-2012.
The managing director, Graham Turner, said that FlightCentre had 8 per cent of its profits in the first half of the year and had begun the second half of the year with good performance, especially for weekly travel to Australia and the United Kingdom.
“From the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits in our 10 countries, and for some of them, a record high return is expected for the full year, before interest and tax contributions are taken off,” he said.
“This includes Australia and Great Britain, which usually bring us the greatest profits.”
In Australia, the leisure business was restored in the second half of the year, making up for a somewhat weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in Britain’s Flight Center’s leisure business, leisure activities were good, while corporate customers spent less.
Her business in the United States had compensated for the losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half of the year and was expected to earn revenue for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday's Flight Centre equity grew by 3 cents to $38.20.
On 31 October, two playrooms were identified by the Barnaul police.
The first one worked in the Industrial Region on the street of Wothena.
At the time of testing, there was a game in the establishment.
There's 24 assault rifles in the club.
Another game club was found in Lenin neighborhood on Anton Petrov Street.
20 game machines were used here.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for Barnaulu reports that administrative materials have been prepared under the article “Illicit organization and gambling”.
The technician's been removed.
These facts will soon be referred to the industrial and Leninian courts.
In Yekaterinburg, the perpetrator killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Ekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who has been cruelly executed by two sisters.
Their bodies were burned after the murder.
As reported by the New Region in the Ministry of Internal Affairs Press Service for the Sverdlov region, on the eve of the day in the Krov district of the Ural capital, two women with signs of violent death were found in the bodies of two women after the fire was extinguished in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Uralsk Street.
Soon the identity of the victims was established.
It turned out to be sisters, one of whom was a woman from Ekaterinburg for 44 years, and the other was a 33-year-old resident from Orenburg.
The burning apartment they rented a few days ago.
His investigation took control of the main police region of Mikhail Bordeen.
The internal affairs authorities have worked out various cases of murder, and they have tested the alibis of previously convicted citizens and those who are inclined to commit such acts.
It is also established for what purpose women have rented their apartment and where they have lived before, what they have been doing, and with whom they have maintained relations.
Schools called for greater attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature since 1914.
The examination will also include “extra-programme texts” to encourage broader reading.
The joint course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will be required to pass a separate language graduation examination, with strong recommendations on the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is expected to produce new educational programmes in English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically revised.
It will make changes to other major items next year.
A separate regulatory body for the OFQUAL examination will present a revised structure for the secondary school exams, with a new evaluation system and a lower level of exchange rate work.
During the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Howe, said that there was “a broad consensus that we must reform our examination system in order to restore public confidence”, insisting that the school graduation exams would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week for a quarter) than most countries do.
By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has about 138 hours of students.
Although there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on math calendars, the coalition sources said that large-scale school math exams combined with a higher ratio in the rating table are likely to provide further education for schools on this subject.
At the educational level, greater attention will be paid to “real-life challenges”, including financial mathematics.
The Heiha tickets will cost tourists 2,200 roubles
As of tomorrow, tourists will be carrying ships on airbags from the Blaschevnsk in Heihe.
For those wishing to go to China, that means extra expenses.
The puma ticket is traditionally much more expensive than the heat.
The cost of the regular ticket is 2,200 roubles, as reported in the Amurasso reference service.
Travel through the high comfort hall will cost 2,800 roubles.
In fact, during this season, tickets did not travel — at the same price, pumas carried tourists both in the spring and a year ago in the autumn.
Dimitri Medvedev: GDP growth rates of the Russian Federation are insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dimitri Medvedev considers its GDP growth to be insufficient for the Russian Federation, and he is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business credit and by changing the structure of the Russian economy through innovation, reports Reuters.
We planned to increase GDP this year in the 3% area, maybe a little bit more.
It's actually going to be a little less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of a recession in a number of countries in Europe, it seems not very bad, but for us it is not so bad because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, for development to take place, there must be a higher rate.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses, receive normal loans at a normal cost — the first thing that must be done,” stressed the head of Government.

Travel on dirt, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwell provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwell and his team spend almost every weekend receiving hundreds of patients
In this West African country, doctors are less than one per 5,000 people
vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwell is one of CNN ' s top 10 heroes in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 major heroes to become CNN's Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and fall unconscious again, leaping into hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwell was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, Cameroon’s capital.
At first he had a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused hematoma, which reminded him of herself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwell.
If we had the money, we'd have taken it out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwell accompanied his father for years at overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they might have received.
“It's not easy, ” said Bwell.
- You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first one, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation has not changed significantly since Bwell's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413.
And even if Cameroonians were able to see a doctor, many of them would not be in their pockets.
Two out of five people in that country lived below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of health expenditure was private.
“They are the only problem of poverty,” said Bwell.
“And because of their poverty they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwell and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
It also established a non-profit organization, ASCOVIME, which organizes visits to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others get into the vans, attach medical supplies to the roofs, and travel across the border to visit the villages in need.
They don't always have luck.
More than once, they had to push cars through rivers and dirt.
But when they arrive, they are seen as real heroes — a celebration with songs and dances and the best rooms available to the local people.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a occasion for the holiday, and Bwell, with his broad smile and boundless energy, is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the brigade starts receiving hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people on each trip,” said Bwell.
They come from all over the district within a distance of 60 kilometres [60 km] from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive brushes, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for a school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
At evenings, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
The operations are generally performed in the school, municipality or home building; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the post-operation zone to make room for the next person.
Using the generator to cover the maintenance and sanitation of the equipment, Bwell and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's an unstoppable pace, but the team's dedication is usually helpful in supporting village musicians.
“They beat the drums all night so we can keep awake and keep working,” said Bwell.
On Sunday, members of the brigade head back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
The team, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations during the past year, and they know that their assistance may be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free operation he had received to treat the herb would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical services during the weekend and in the hospital, surgeon Bwell also works at private medical clinics around Yaoundé during the night.
It was this second job, he said, that provided 60 per cent of the funding for his non-profit organization; the remaining funds were covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Cathy O'Malley, a medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, volunteer in Bwell's group.
He's always in the hospital or he's trying to make money for the organization so that we can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, it's a possibility of a practice that they would never have gotten at home.
“We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold Dr. Bwell’s tools,” said O'Malley.
As a student student student, you'd never get that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often with donated drugs.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their food, transportation, and training are paid by Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely.
For Bwell, almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
Helping others to live a happy life, keeping their father’s promise, is something that brings him great joy.
“I am so happy when I do this job, ” said Bwell.
- And I'm thinking about my dad.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it so that people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do.
Snowden agreed to testify to Merkel's audition.
A member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strabele met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the interview, the question was raised as to whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the FWG Attorney-General ' s Office in the case of a possible audition of the German chancellor ' s telephone by the U.S. special forces.
Snowden was willing to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear,' said Hans Christian Strebele, "that he knows a lot.
Although the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to return to Germany.
But first we need to define clearly all the conditions of his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators are beginning to respond to a scandal around U.S. spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved yesterday a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the United States Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey have an interest in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
This was stated to journalists by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir MacKay, at a press conference following the meeting with Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey, reported by the correspondent of BELT.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels have an interest in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, and we have agreed that the two government authorities will provide widespread cooperation and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves,” Vladimir MacKay noted.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all necessary conditions and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, resulting in a protocol.
The Parties have developed a road map of Belarusian-Turkeyn interaction which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and the search for new forms and areas of interaction.
“The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am confident that the present protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey see each other as reliable partners,” he said.
The Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that at the talks, the heads of foreign policy agencies of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and projects.
In the view of the Minister, the trade between Belarus and Turkey needs to be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey was also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needed to be further developed, since there was an unutilized potential in that area, he believed.
There have always been very warm relations between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
All the necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the success of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” Achmet Davutoglu noted.
Obama refuses to say anything about health care
In the midst of a storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday frowned on his often repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it”.
In view of the fact that hundreds of thousands of people had received notices to stop providing services from their providers, the Republicans had criticized the President in recent days for misleading American society.
Obama adjusted his initial public promise a little yesterday.
“Most people with health insurance that works can keep it," he said in his statement in Boston.
Referring to what he called “news rejuvenation” regarding the termination of services, Obama encouraged Americans receiving such notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
“You will have better conditions,” he said.
The Administration stated that it should not be surprising that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own might be forced to change plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required by the law on affordable health care.
“Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Sibelius in a statement to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable medical care, said that the launch of the Internet sales site had been “desirably poor” since October.
“I’m upset and angry just like everybody else, ” she said.
I really want your trust back."
An angry Sibelius dropped the phrase, caught by an integrated microphone sitting behind her at yesterday's court hearings, following a heated debate with Billie Long, a member of the House of Representatives from Missouri State, as to whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long again urged Sibelius to say why the “Archect” of the law on affordable medical care has voluntarily refused government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
"Rosbolt" was disqualified from media status for a non-censor's robe.
On 31 October, Mosgorud decided to declare invalid the registration licence for the company "Rosbolt", writes Lenta.
Roskomnadzor insisted that the media agency be deprived of its status for systematic and gross violations of the Law on the Media.
In the course of the proceedings, an unpleasant precedent had been set: the court had found it possible to close the media by effectively refusing to issue counter-arguments.
What's "Rosbolt"?
The project “The Rosbolt Information Agency” was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the years that followed, the Agency opened a second main office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The Agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, “Rosbolt” has developed and functioned as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognized private online media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbolt has always been a very specific niche: the core of the exclusive publications of the agencies was (and still is) notes referring to sources of law enforcement agencies.
Discussions about the proximity of the publication to the force structures continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
In addition to having a wide base of sources in various departments, Rosbolt also said that the project was headed by Natalie Chaplin, the wife of Victor Cherkesov.
However, the role of Chaplina in the "Rosbolt" guide is not fully clear: it is often referred to as "the project manager".
The director-General of the agency is Larissa Afonina, chief editor, Nicolai Ulyanov.
In recent times, Robbalt has not appeared in the federal media ratings, either by quote or by audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the Russian media website attendance rating on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), and about three million unique visitors per month.
Among the most popular material in the last five months are the notes on Kremlin's inability to deal with Ukraine, the death of a soloist in the "King and Coward" group, the pogroms in the city of Birulev.
The conflict between Rosbolta and Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the Media Act came into force prohibiting journalists from engaging in non-censorship.
The agency found banned vocabulary in two video clips published on the website (Gigit of Krasnodar and Pussy Riot desecrated oil rigs).
The other parties describe it differently.
Roskomnadzor, on the basis of the video found, accused “Rosbolt” of gross and systematic violation of the media law and requested the court to obtain a licence from the agency.
“Rosebolt” stated that the agency's claims were not correct: first, the ads were not editorial materials; secondly, the words in them were disguised; and thirdly, they were removed from the site as soon as they were prevented.
The Agency ' s representatives appealed to the world court against Roskomnadzor ' s claims - and when Mosgorud accepted the case of Roskomnadzor on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, on the 25th of August, the judge of the peace ruled against “Rosebolt”: the editor-in-chief, Nicholas Ulyanov, found guilty of violating the Administrative Offences Code and fined 20,000 roubles, 10,000 per video.
This obviously predated the outcome of the Mosgord hearing - if we gave up the idea that the outcome might have been anticipated earlier.
On 31 October, the court ruled that the certificate of registration of “Rosbolt” was invalid, effectively depriving the media agency of its status.
It can't be said that "Rosbolt" was alone in this confrontation.
The Agency supported the deputies of the State (a statement to the head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, was signed on 10 October by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of CRC).
The President of the Union of Journalists of the Russian Federation, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Paul Gussev, and the President of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotov, claimed that the publication had been wrongfully closed.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the Rokomnadzor leadership even provided him with some assurance that the case would not come before the licence was withdrawn.
The “Rosbolt” trial showed that under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be in the media in Russia today, a big question.
Syria destroyed chemical equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capabilities and recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament, Damascus, has completed the day before the deadline.
Prior to 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other support facilities intended for the preparation of military toxic substances for use and to transfer them to BBC.
Destruction of the stockpiles of poisonous substances or their chemical components is expected to be completed by mid-2014.
According to the OPCW representative, poisons were currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on 21 August in the outskirts of Damascus, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from making more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for the mixing of chemicals and ammunition.
These capacities will now be closely monitored in order to avoid repairing them.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time OPCW and the Syrians should agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by the Western Intelligence Services.
They are willing to advise the inspectors on new verification facilities if they suspect that Damascus is not fully revealed.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is a matter of the hands of the Syrian rebels.
The world community has demanded the Syrian leadership, as agreed through Russian mediation, to destroy or render unmanned all capabilities for the production of missiles, gases and liquids and for the filling of shells by these substances.
Now that this phase has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of the Syrian Army ' s already available chemical weapons.
It is estimated that there may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve and paralytic toxic substances, each explosive mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in dozens of different locations.
For it to be destroyed, it is essential that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities agree on a timetable for action to begin - for two weeks.
The OPCW Head of Field Operations, Jerry Smith, told the BBC that its inspectors had “personally observed the destruction of equipment”.
"They are no longer able to continue producing or mixing chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found that the ammunition and poisoning plants had either been destroyed or destroyed.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to be inspected there, as stated in the document, but the equipment was transported from there and verified by OPCW experts.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical infrastructure was “especially difficult” as it had to work in a context of ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but according to Smith, it was time to celebrate it before the inspectors could find it - they were too busy.
John Kerry says, in his unprecedented recognition, that the U.S. spying “has gone an inappropriate distance”
John Kerry has shown that U.S. surveillance protection tactics have been mitigated by an unprecedented recognition that in some cases, US espionage “has gone inappropriately far”.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barak Obama, of being “on-board pilot” at the time of the loud exposures of Edward Snowden to the spying activities of the NSA.
These leaks have put the U.S. Government at the centre of diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on a video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, actually perceived some of the things that are happening on the autopilot, because this was an opportunity that existed — both during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the cold war, and of course 11 September.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the U.S. spying went too far, but stressed that no one had been violated.
He said: "In some cases it has gone far indecency.
And the President is determined to shed light on this issue and explain it to the people, and he is now undertaking a thorough analysis to ensure that no one feels abused.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted with good motives and that its tracking operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are willing to explode.
There is a radical extremism in the world, a reckless and determined determination to kill, explode and attack Governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We have indeed prevented the crash of aircraft, the explosion of buildings and the killing of people because we have been able to learn about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, United States legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to US spying abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, said the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
The senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had spoken with members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to cease participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of the disappointment with the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency.
“It is indeed important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said the first-time democracy of the Senate in Washington, D.C.
“And I am going to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programmes.”
News reports that NSA has collected millions of phone recordings in Europe have worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the agency head claimed this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other exposures included documents published by Snowden indicating that NSA monitored the German Chancellor's mobile phone, Angela Merkel, as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Klapper, defended spying against allies as necessary and said that this was a common case on both sides.
Against the backdrop of this noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a trip of members of the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and of both chambers.
The names of other lawmakers involved should be made available in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
While he stated that the purpose of the visit was to contribute to a better relationship, he said that some degree of “best motivation” would also be demonstrated.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spy programmes they had been using for many years.
“While we can change our tracking programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities,” said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry must go to the Middle East and to Poland this weekend to resolve the problems of hostility against the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as United States intelligence activities.
In the new compositions of the public monitoring commissions, the influence of the prison population will increase.
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) is able to approve new compositions of the public monitoring commissions (HLCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option to vote is adopted, the lobbyists of the silhouettes will increase their influence.
The INC is a public body which controls the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razzaev, the disturbances in the Copia colony - it is through the OKS that most of the resonant incidents are exposed behind bars.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and security lobbyers to control the NCC.
In the meeting of the OP working group on setting up the NCU, I proposed that human rights experience should be a criterion for selection.
"He wasn't accepted, and they formed lists without the criteria," says Valery Borschev.
Borszchev, current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and Association of Independent Observers - All-Russian Human Rights Defenders working on prison issues.
As a member of the Council of State of Apple, he has drafted a law regulating the activities of the OKS.
The OP Board should vote in favour of the PNC in 43 regions of the country.
There are fewer than a thousand candidates for 1,800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Cabardino Balcaria, competitions were not organized owing to a lack of candidates.
The OP promises to arrange for the recruitment of vacant seats.
The OKN of Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new composition instead of 20.
According to Borschev, the current composition of the capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 silviators, while the voting version of the OP changes the ratio by 17 to 23.
However, 30 human rights defenders wanted to be admitted to the capital commission.
However, Vyacheslav Kalinin may be re-membered as a member of the War Brotherhood.
He had been a member of the NCC for three years, but had never visited prisoners.
Borszchev believes that by appointing their Chairman of the NCC, human rights defenders will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unendurable and human rights defenders do not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the movement of the security forces was coordinated by Anton Czevetkov, a member of the NCC, who headed “Russian officers”, an organization for the defence of the interests of the forces.
"I don't eat babies on the road," said RBC daily Anton Flowers.
He denied that he was lobbying for any lists and said that he did not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
He didn't even care what list he was voting for, according to Kolekov.
He considers the publication of information on debt to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in the leadership of the Chilean NCC.
Her former leaders will be suspended because of last year's Copisian unrest.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the management of the local commission had ignored the problems of the prisoners.
And here's OkS Rostov-na-Donu, who can move from human rights defenders to the scholastics.
From the new lists, the human rights defender chairing the local commission was one of his opponents, despite the fact that he had been expelled by the Federal Public Chamber in May 2013 for non-ethical behaviour.
The lists of the Moscow and Rosivan Commissions of Borschev consider it "city for Copisk".
The findings of Hope Toloconniko did not affect Mordovia's NCC, which is considered “forced”, but only one human rights defender wanted to become a new member, and she did not even have the documents to compete.
The Board member of OP, Nicholas Swanidze, told RBC Daily that he had voted against the proposed list because he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov na Don.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His OP colleague, Paul Gussev, says that he voted in favour of the proposed Moscow list.
Co-ordinated the drafting of the NCC lists by the Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, who is also a member of the FSIN Research Institute.
Grib told the RBC Daily that he did not consider it appropriate to divide candidates for human rights defenders and for the silhouettes, and disagreed that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient powers to interfere with the work of its members.
The Groom is not intended to predict the vote of the JP Board.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended option will be put to the vote in the coming days.
The Australian woman appealed against the prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuquet Island for false allegations that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on 15 June by the Phuquet Provincial Court of filing a false claim after reporting to the Thai police that the local taxi driver had attacked her on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men had held her.
However, video cameras later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted that she had fabricated the story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15-day prison terms at the general regime detention centre in the District of Phuketa and not in the adult women ' s prison.
She is the daughter of a former player of the Australian League, Peter Tanx, who sought the help of his daughter, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tanx told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “very concerned” about her daughter's well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“It is obvious that this was an alarming time, but we hope that she will return home safely as soon as possible,” said Tanx.
Bamford appealed his sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on leave in the Kraby resort area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could result in the court increasing her sentence to two years and forcing her to serve her sentence in an adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of Australian traveler Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek the restoration of its damaged tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Roman Sanchin is now in Paris, presenting his novel "Eltisheva", translated into French.
It was this novel that became the finalist of the four prizes: "Bright Polyana", "Russk Booker", "National Best Seller" and "The Big Book".
Last year, a writer for the book was awarded the prizes of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Sanchin is the unquestionable leader of the current 30-year-olds and 40-year-old prosaics.
Almost every publication of its hard, modern - day narratives and narratives is a source of heated controversy among critics in a wide variety of ways.
It can be argued that the combined articles on Sienchina's prose and publicity, the reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
The debate on the works of “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, according to Criticist Sergei Chuprinin, is mostly about what its participants mean by the word “literacy”, what the present and future not only of our verbality but also of our lives see.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for most articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are generally given in the abbreviations in the sections “Absas”
