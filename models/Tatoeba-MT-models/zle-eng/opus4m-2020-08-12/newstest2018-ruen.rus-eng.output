The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has signed a law imposing administrative liability for breach of the time and procedure for payment of goods (work, services) in the conduct of procurement for public and municipal needs.
The law is intended to address the very acute problem of the failure of employers to comply with their obligations in public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs could not receive payment under existing government and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to take special control of the problem.
Because the businessmen themselves were unable to deal with unfair employers who entered into unfunded contracts, tried to avoid the obligations they had made and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has submitted 9,700 submissions, 4,500 officials have been brought to disciplinary proceedings and 533 administrative officers have submitted 75 submissions to the investigative authorities for the conduct of the investigations, 46 of which have been prosecuted.
As a result, over 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
These enormous amounts have not been accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion-dollar contracts.
Verbatim debt has resulted in numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for far more modest amounts.
Here's a special case.
The head of a small company won a competition for social transport services for several million roubles.
A person has invested all his working funds, has fully complied with his obligations, but has not received the money in time.
The result is a growing financial coma of arrears in salaries, taxes, and loans that would have led to bankruptcy if the employer had not sought assistance from the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The problem has now been eliminated in a number of regions.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of the year 2017, the total amount of public and municipal debt identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt rates continue to reach critical levels, the Public Prosecutor's Office operates under a manual crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally holds visiting meetings with local authorities, at which all violations revealed by prosecutors and measures to address them immediately are dealt with.
Such operational meetings have already been held this year in Yaroslav and Ekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ on the amendment of the Code of Administrative Offences to establish the administrative liability of the employer ' s officials for violating the time and procedure for payment of goods (work, services) in the conduct of the procurement to ensure State and municipal needs will improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law had been drafted by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Office of the Attorney-General.
The new law would supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with an article which provided for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for breach by an official of the employer of the time and procedure for payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he or she will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the implementation of these legislative innovations in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Unit issued a warning of movement to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Populations has issued a warning to colour travelers in Missouri because of State discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: “A warning to travelers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Populations, in effect until 28 August 2017, calls upon African American travellers, visitors and citizens of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to exercise greater caution in their travels to the state in connection with a number of questionable racist incidents recently occurring throughout the state and here.”
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Populations, the recent Missouri law led to the announcement of a mobility warning, which made it more difficult for people to win claims of discrimination, and the fact that State law enforcement agencies have disproportionately chosen minority members as their targets.
“You have human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin color, beaten and killed,” said the Canzas City Star, by Rod Chepel, President of the National Association for the Advancement of the Coloured People of Missouri.
“We hear complaints more than ever before.”
This is the first such warning announced by the organization in relation to the U.S. state.
The Group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas during his trip to the state and was arrested by the Missouri State Police without being charged with a crime.
The warning also refers to the recent report of the Missouri State Attorney General, according to which the likelihood of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for whites.
“The aim of warning people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” said Chepel.
“People need to be prepared, whether they will take the money with them for bail or tell their relatives that they are traveling in state territory.”
According to the latest data from the FBI ' s hate crime report programme, 100 hate crimes were reported in Missouri in 2015, making the State ' s 16th rate of such violations.
The warning of movement was also a response to the new Missouri State law, which would make it more difficult to bring proceedings against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Earlier, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Freedoms (ACLU) had issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona following the adoption by these states of new immigration control laws ordering local law enforcement agencies to arrest persons for violations of immigration laws, which ACCLU considered should have increased racially based inspections.
Warnings on movement are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but public organizations have recently responded to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed by shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
The unknown fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian town of Isna, reporting Reuters with reference to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
Two people, including one police officer, were killed and three were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the vehicle, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement personnel.
One of the perpetrators has been arrested, the other has managed to escape.
Rostourism supports the law on the abolition of free luggage for non-returnable air tickets
The head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview with the TV channel RBC that “positive” refers to the adoption of a law abolishing the free transportation of luggage on non-return flights.
"You have to create the conditions under which a person without luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than a person with luggage," he said.
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that despite the fears of the citizens, no payment would have to be made for the passage of the upper clothes and mobile phone in the handbag.
"It would be proper to calm down all our citizens and tourists and to say it, to say it's to outer garments, umbrellas, mobile phones, iPad or even a computer," said the head of Rostourism.
Formerly, Russian President Vladimir Putin had signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule of free transportation of luggage on a non-returnable airline ticket.
It is that airlines can determine the number and weight of luggage included in the non-return tariff.
Vladimir Putin commissioned the elimination of the pollution of Baikal
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at the Baikal protection meeting, reported that in recent years significant areas of the lake had been severely polluted.
It mandated the identification of sources of funding, plans and actors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also commissioned a full rehabilitation of contaminated areas.
“It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here that most of them are worn out,” cites the President's RIA News.
He also added that the Office of the Procurator-General of Russia should conduct an inspection to detect environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with natural landfills and a number of environmental disturbances by rest-organizers.
"I want to emphasize this: not all checks are in progress, but the measure needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and appropriate measures to be taken," he stressed.
In the past, the Office of the Attorney-General had reported a decline in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of environmentally controlled sites.
On 15 June, Vladimir Putin stated in a direct line the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural areas of the special protection regime.
He was informed of economic problems by the residents of the island of Olhoon, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory.
The Head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donski, immediately proposed a solution to the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal Water Area, but in the Government of Buryatia, it was recalled that such a change was not sufficient, as restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, the Ministry of Economy had proposed a solution to the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
There's a new temple in South.
In the village of Sosová, members of the North ' s small indigenous community, Rakhtinja, are involved in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honour of the Clergy of Nicholas the Miracle.
Its location is a riverbank, and the temple will be visible from a distance, so it will serve as a guide lighthouse for fishermen.
According to the community, the construction work will be completed this year, the domes are now installed and the church bells are available.
The IGR of the fleet provided escorts.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Miracle Worker because he is honored by the Orthodox Church as the patron of travelers, including fishermen.
At the same time, fishing gives settlers work, feeding them.
The local people wait for the temple to open its doors, and the children even write about it as a local attraction in school.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are Singapore law - abiding?
I'm talking to a local businessman named Chang, sitting in a restaurant in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while he carefully stores the cigarettes in the iron box he has taken from his office.
After the interview is over, the businessman goes to the nearest urn -- a hundred meters -- and throws the bulls out there.
A fine for garbage in a public place is 500 local dollars, says Chang.
You know, since I was a kid, I've just had a reflex. You can't throw a phantom on the bridge.
And now it's all over the camera.
Indeed, Singapore’s sidewalks in the center of the city are as clean as a museum.
Chang says three months ago his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted a graphite wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the boy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to corruption.
What?
Imagine.
He received ten wooden blows at the berries and spent a week in prison.
We don't have much body punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and unerringly harsh laws, the AIF observer was on the spot.
There's nobody here thinking of abolishing the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government doesn't care about the European Union and the United States for a long time.
If a person drives a large shipment of drugs or trades in them, he'll have a hangover.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian national was detained at Changi airport carrying 400 g of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister spoke in his defense, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
But the guy was hanged anyway.
Since then, drug dealers have gone around the country as hard as they can.
The point is that Singapore has a duty to respect everything in a row, not just the modest and the poor.
It doesn't matter who you are, you're a millionaire, you're a vice-premier, you're a famous artist or a European Union resident.
There's one option: if you find a pound of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you're walking through Singapore and you're meeting a bunch of warnings everywhere, you're just being surprised at how many bans there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing rubber is only sold in pharmacies, and it can be purchased strictly by a doctor’s prescription (!).
The tourist will not be taken away from the gum when he arrives, but it is worth putting a "slice" in the subway, putting in a fine of 1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white tablets on their neck, "I was trashing."
In addition to fines, unloaded urns are often sentenced to a “thorn in the palaces” for a week to clean up parks and beaches.
A “criminal” who forgets to wash the water in a public toilet pays 6,000 roubles, and a special detector works in an effort to alleviate the little need for an elevator in a residential home - locks the doors and sends a signal to the police.
Among the most exotic laws are the prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs, and even excessive flooding of room plants (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry incendiary lighters, or fined 5,000 Singaporean bucks.
In general, the thought is, no matter how hard you try, you're bound to break something.
It's not like that, but it's trying to test me, Muhammad Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of the local travel agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years, I haven't seen anyone get involved for their violation.
Why do they stay?
Don't let the citizens relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let's say that if a minor is sold in a basket of cigarettes, he will be punished in the chain: the store owner will pay a huge sum, the breaker himself will receive the kicks at the back, and the seller will also be thrown out and put in prison.
It is because of such harsh laws that offences are rare in Singapore.
Is this justified?
As early as the 1970 ’ s, we had a traffic chaos — motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wished, and drove intoxicated.
After fines were imposed in one year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having a drink of whisky, knows that if they stop, the police will not be released for a bribe, fined the value of the apartment, and will be sent to jail for years.
To many foreigners, the city-state in South-East Asia appears to be a type of concentration camp.
In 1993, U.S. writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" -- a U.S. visitor had the horror of the universal wealth of the inhabitants, the “terrorous clean airport” and the “cultural nature”.
Deciphering, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and that's how it should not be.
For the first days in Singapore, and you're really afraid to throw a paper on the sidewalk, you're caught when you get into the subway with an ice cream.
But then you go to the little India area, and then suddenly, the template is broken, and the bus stop is full of plastic glasses.
"What's that like?" You wonder.
That's right, the Singaporeans are smiling.
Everything happens.
Not every crime like this will be seized in its place, but you must know that if you are counted, you will not be killed, for you have transgressed the law.
Most of all, it's enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam’s Hoshem, I moved very carefully — motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty bums and beggars.
In our streets too, not everyone tries to throw trash into urns.
Singapore has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on earth, thanks to the use of dragon fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
This is human nature: remember, and no one in Russia has been driving until they've been fined.
Although Singapore ' s main focus was not fines but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we should think that in Russia, people would be happy to have clean streets, no trash on the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who have confused the elevator with the public toilet.
I mean, corporal punishment, thank you, don't.
In the rest of Singapore’s laws, however, are at least worth looking into.
Nothing holy?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting statues.
Americans understand this no less than the rest of us - the deliberate theater demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein in the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Trump Government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he put a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty during a violent dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about President's proposals to dramatically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue itself.
The multitude of owners of pleasureships and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would have lynched him if he had tried to do so.
But he tried to understand her, especially the meaning she had received in 1903, 17 years after the monument had been completed, when Emma Lazarous’s poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller screamed at Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that enshrines the world.
The formation you are talking about was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller correctly described the facts, but as he said, it's not really about history.
It's about the current rise of Lazarus' amazing words, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, your crowds who dream of breathing freely"
Never before have "unfortunate waste" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature -- he made it clear that in America, the Trump of these people is not waiting.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a debate about the meaning of America.
Lazarous and her friends, who fought to place her words on the ceiling of the statue after her death, understood very well that they were committing a totally political act.
A sculpture was intended to mark the link between the French and the American republics by means of a banal classic figure, the female image of Liberty.
Lazarous changed her meaning: In her poem, the female figure was no longer abstract, she had a voice.
And she was given a totally different name: Mother of Escaped.
The combination of poems and images was a brilliant feminist movement and a devastating attack against American Nazism.
And how Lazarous changed the meaning of the statue, but he was right to change it back.
Rush Limbo, who was like John the Baptizer, who was preaching Trump's arrival in 2010, thought that Freedom was not inviting anyone; rather, it was an early neoconservator carrying the flames of America lying in the darkness of the world: " Freedom is moving forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch isn't needed to light the way to the U.S.."
It was against Limbo's custom that really got to the point.
The purpose of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would have been seen by exhausted, unhappy but full of hope on the decks of the ship after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and the hospitality they wish to hear.
And of course, that's not the prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch is needed not to light the way, but to inflame hatred, which is their only source of strength.
World Championship 2017: Neil Blake commends Scottish members of the assembled British.
Elijah Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scotsmen in the assembled U.K.
Neil Blake, director of the game of the British Federation of Light Athletics, stated that the 16-person Scottish part of the World Championship would make “a significant contribution to the team's game”.
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected at the London Championship of 2017, beginning on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland “something special is being born” and the Federation of Light Athletics of Great Britain should take that into account.
'We know it and we're trying to understand it and support it while they have the capacity,' said Blake.
"I've talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's connected to what they've done.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics thinks that what they've done must work.
The British Federation of Easy Athletics: what they did is to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why things are so great, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some of the Scottish athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres; and Alyid Doyle chose his captain.
"Alyd is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"Many athletes, whether Scottish or not, and from where they live or practice, have come out of this room, feeling proud and determined to win.
The passions and sincere feelings Alyde had in her were excellent."
The owner of the Commonwealth silver medal, who, at his fifth World Cup, would run a distance of 400 metres with obstacles, said that 16 Scots in the British prefabricated championship were "unbelievable".
The previous record of Scottishs in the World Championship was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Lora Muir, a middle-end runner who has beaten five British and two European records in the past year, is on the move.
She'll run 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Har, who's going to run for 1500 meters, is another Scotsman who's worth paying attention to: behind his back is a good season in which the winners of the British prefabricated competitions and the Annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first world championship when she was the only Scotchman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says she's "unbelievably proud" that so many of her compatriots not only entered the collective but in some cases they'll claim medals and fight for the finals.
"The team's capital is chosen by other members of the team, so it was an honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen -- it's a very special thing to me," she added.
"Of course I'm very proud of all Scotsmen who have entered the assembly.
This shows how much we have done.
And they are all a few of them who will seek to reach the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I just noticed that we were lucky enough to take home the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of what we're going to be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in his competitions, and the atmosphere there will be wonderful."
Frictioning critics on Facebook: You don't have to go to a public office if you're not ready to listen to voter criticism.
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from critical of everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
His criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "we, the deaf and the dumb, can be taken away as sheep for slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
The Hogan subjects blocked and wiped out the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his Facebook official page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Alliance sued him for it.
The governor's subjects called this action null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's important, too.
And this is especially important when it comes to Hogan-like guy.
He's an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
He's second in the rating of 50 governors in the country.
Hogan's not a stubborn reactionor.
He showed a firm hand in state management and a commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as the primary means of communicating with his voters and of jokingly showing his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
It is therefore unnecessary and ultimately harmful to block people coming to the governor's page - which is declared to be an official public forum and is being held by officials of the administration for the money of taxpayers.
In an interview with Washington Post, the Spokesperson, Amelia Ches, defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was simply a modernization of comments.
But it's too easy to use images of trolls, spams, and gamers on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And it's the real people, not the trolls, who are the teacher, the businessman, the pastor who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and non-breathing.
The pastor quoted the Bible as appealing that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Romana, from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred but asked about hate crimes.
"I have written a polite comment that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the section of her comments to the post article.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some people immediately say that it's a so-called glove rather than admitting they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call a “concentrated spam attaché”, others would probably call a “active life-position”.
In the Facebook era, it is easy to change your image simply by blocking critics or erase negative comments.
It is much less drinking than it used to be when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical fronts or arresting and closing the mouth of protestors.
But it's exactly what's happening right now, only in the number.
Hogan is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media networks.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been dropped from his Twitter account.
One of the first major decisions on the subject was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. district judge from Alexandria, James K. Ceceris, the president of the county supervisory council of Laudon County violated the First Amendment by beating the voter in his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin filed claims with the American Civil Liberties Alliance for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
It must not be that hard.
In Washington, D.C., a period of affordable postal spending was about the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers has quadrupled and anonymous letters have severely undermined its credibility.
And even then Washington dealt with anonymous trolls.
People named Juricola, Valerius, Belize and Porcius wrote letters to newspapers deriding Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online George Washington Documentation project, his office was overwhelmed by petitions critical of his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech is at the very heart of our State.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty looks forward to homemade accommodations at the Renaissance Club.
The former European champion, Ronan Rafferty, hopes for accommodations for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lotian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
A Northern Irish man who led the neighborhood at Archerfield Links and moved towards the final round last year, until he lost Paul Ilsa, is attached to the new seat and serves as the representative of the tournament on behalf of Jerry Sarwady, founder and director of the Club.
“I've seen the Renaissance Club build, and we're seeing it succeed with this event,” said Rafferty.
"The players will see this field in his best moment, it's in excellent condition.
Jerry did a great job setting this place up.
He's a strong supporter of this game, and he's proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils looks forward to the opportunity to defend championship for the first time, despite the fact that he won his 32-year career both in the European tournament and in the European Challenge Tour.
“This is a really special feeling,” said a Southport player.
"I failed to try to win Extramadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule one year after I won it.
It's magic to go back to this corner of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was indeed a special time, and we will always remember it.”
Returning to battle on Gary Orr ' s native land, he joined the European Senior Sports Tour after he was 50 earlier this year.
This event will be its first public appearance in Scotland during the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"When you play at home, it's always a bit more important," said a resident of Helensborough Orr.
"You want to speak well, but you feel this extra burden."
I'm very happy to play again, and I've shown you a good golf.
I am pleased with the way things are being done so far.”
In this trio, former winner of the Masters tournament, Ian Wesnem, and major champion champions champions for senior athletes, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Thorance are two of the six Scottishs on the field; the others are Andrew Oldhorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmur and Ross Drummond.
Participation in a tournament for free, and parking costs £5 per hour if there's one person in the car, and £10 if there's two or more.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn how to absorb harmful emissions
Car tunnels capable of absorbing carbon dioxide emitted from cars are already being tested on British roads.
The country ' s transport agency reported positive results on a 100-metre tunnel installed on one of the roads in the north of the country, according to Autocar.
The tunnel, which is six metres high, is made up of some new polymer materials that are capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in motor vehicle exhausts.
However, the establishment of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the major measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charge stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of activities to reduce road traffic, increase the use of commercial electricity and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is attributed to transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths a year.
Mosgord changed the punishment of a disabled mother to a fine
Mosgarud changed the sentence of four and a half years ' imprisonment to 200,000 roubles for disabled Anton Mamaev.
This is reported by TASS.
The Public Prosecutor's Office had previously asked the court to replace the term for conditionality by explaining its request that Mamaev's disease “impeds him to prison conditions”.
Anton Mamaev, 28 years old, was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment, serving a sentence in a general regime prison for a robbery committed by a former Special Forces fighter.
On 19 July, the court released the man from custody at a retreat in SIZO.
Poverty and death in Indonesian “gold land”
Bardin Dehei does not use the stove in preparation for lunch.
She doesn't even use a potion.
In her wooden home in Enarotal, the capital of Paniai County in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply puts sweet potatoes, called the note here, right into the house.
After half an hour, the charred tubers are obtained and eaten by impatient, unwashed hands.
Deheii sits on the ground floor – she doesn't have furniture – and it's where she does her housework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom is a bucket in the room without a roof.
She's the youngest of four wives to her husband, so she's not assigned to work in the field.
There's a lot of life here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous — many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and some are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk through the village after five o'clock," she said.
This is a rare opportunity to see daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which joined Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The current movement of independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintains strong control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
The Enarotals are as remote as the abandoned city; the road here includes a 1 / 6 hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative center, to Nabir and then a five - hour shake on a hired car.
There's no public transport here.
A city with a population of about 19,000 is made up of wooden houses covered with bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of redish shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of them.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the papas were worshiping a god named Uha Tame.
There were other changes.
“ It was not our custom to wear these clothes, ” says Dehei, pointing to his bright, handcuffed turban, dark skirt, and bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on the body.”
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population lives below the poverty line, and infant mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The largest gold mine in the world and the most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Panai, a highland province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freport obtained gold and copper by about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can boast of a 78 billion dollars worth of forest.
These assets, however, have led to one tragedy for the popes, guaranteeing that the powerful Indonesian armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation into The New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, up to $150,000 to an officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the popes threaten the existence of this golden dwelling and are being violently suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 papuas have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua during the seventies could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything”, a report published in 2016 by the Archbishop diocese, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture – especially frequent, as another report claims, rape and electric shocks – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of casualties because incidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harrisono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Guyks have been prolonged, as Papua's resources have attracted the influx of other Indonesians.
The province ' s 3.5-million population is 83 per cent Christian, but demographics change with the arrival of Muslim economic migrants from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan benches, warungs, sell roast chicken and a mixture of hado-gado vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to resist competition.
“Migrants have begun selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than Papuan indigenous people”, explains Abet Yow, a 20-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapurou, provincial administrative centre, because of her work.
“This has resulted in the loss of Papuan indigenous mothers (women) of Papua’s market.”
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, known as Jokovi, vowed to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter obtained support from 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and the local people feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” says João.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokova Paniai suffered tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas anthems by a cat in Enarotal, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle burst out of the dark.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and soon returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk chased the children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Aimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government electoral commission building, and the next day the situation worsened.
About a thousand Papuasian men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of a local police station and a military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and carried out the White, the dance of the Mee Pago tribe: running in circles and depicting a bird’s song.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation set in, the internal radio personnel were ordered to “if the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them” as claimed in an official document seen by TiME correspondents but not published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremias Kayama, head of the Koto district in Enarotal, sensed the imminent danger and called for calm by asking the crowd to disperse from their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, I suddenly had a bullet in my left wrist,” he told the magazine TIME, standing on the wing of his brightly colored wooden house.
Kaime still doesn't know who shot, but he says that the bullet came from the line of soldiers gathered.
"There was a crowd, there was a lot of shots," he adds.
The local resident, Alphaeus Jowa, was killed three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, relates.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to see if it was him”, said Jochenes, a magazine that, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... "I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, Senior Inspector of the Papuan Police, told reporters that his officers were only protecting their base because it had been attacked.
“We must protect ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Papua Commissioner Pujo Sulistio police officer in 2015.
“This is a question of life and death”.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed, and much more were injured.
News of the murders reached Jakarta only the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi delivered a dusty speech in Jayapura expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately, so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Viranto, said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
“Most of the violations have occurred long ago.
Some of them took place in 90s or at the beginning of zeros.
The fact is, of course, that we want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed,” he said.
Viranto then retracted his words, speaking with the “TIME” magazine of 5 June in Jakarta, and said that he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead he said, "All things will be decided through the judgment."
Viranto, whom the United Nations accused of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people in a bloody vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Panai incident.
The families of the victims from Paniai faced similar allegations with bitter mistrust.
“I have been questioned four times over the last three years, but no change has been made”, says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
“I fear I will be arrested by the military, and I fear I will be shot.”
His brother Jacobus also expressed the view that the people of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he said.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at the villagers in nearby Paniai district of Diyay.
In a confrontation between the villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to help take a man unconscious to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, 20-year-old Ravianus Doww, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the construction site belonging to the company.
According to police officers, the villagers threw stones at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation,” reported the 20-year-old Domingo Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being rushed.
“I hid at home for two days.”
The Diyai Parliament demanded that officers involved in the incident be held accountable and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Denmark has always been a sick spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is a source of resentment among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Movement for the Free of Papua (OPM), an insurgency army that claims to defend the rights of the papuasians by engaging in occasional attacks and raids with kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of OPM come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and arbitrarily detained by the military under the pretext of “Protection of national independence”.
Some never came back.
Among the people of Papua Paniai, it is considered a “bee, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for the local people.
The bread is equally inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat — mainly a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can look after four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually preserve most of the harvest for the family and the rest is sold locally.
Ten tubers stand for only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous papas and new migrants have increased, with large numbers having arrived since the introduction of new flights to the airport of Nabire.
Few existing vacancies usually reach more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuses rarely have enough money or the skills they need to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Panai tribal council.
Exclusion keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of the international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Esquidi and Basil Longshan were deported from Papua for “weak harmony with the organizations concerned” despite the fact that they were rarely allowed to hold a video.
According to Félim Kine, Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, the commitments made during Jokovi's electoral campaign to lift restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development have not been met.
“For the moment, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel East Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: denials of a visa and blacklisting,” he said.
Lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mainly limited to direct neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including shootings in Panai.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
A representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanta Nassir, retracted the statement made by the group by informing journalists in Jakarta that “Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations”.
The locals want more foreign Governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Netherlands Ambassador for Human Rights, Kiys van Baar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, the locals broke the silence by praying, “We want freedom”, as the source claims, who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will be held in 2019, but the popes say it is unlikely that Jokovi will be voted again.
"Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Panai," said Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of threats from the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in a miserable state.
Gobay says that the Paniai, like other Papuas, consider their vote for Jokovi to be a debt that he must pay.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he said.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land in front of the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” says Jacobus, without raising his head.
"What else have we got to do?"
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper Fakel.
The fire struck one of the world's tallest skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave the 70th - story structure 337 metres high.
This is the second fire on a tall building - which is named Fakel - in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported and no operational news was provided about the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” told Reuters, a skyscraper named George.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, the fire brigades extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide shelter for the victims.
The accident can bring back to the agenda the safety of materials used in the outer space of high buildings around the world.
In the course of the investigation by the Faquela administration following the fire there in 2015, it was found that the most affected was the cry, the outside panels used to form and isolate them.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the crying panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the June fire, which killed about 80 people.
The growth of the Ida-Viruma tourist flow in June was minimal
A total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, 125 or 0.6 per cent more than the same period of the year, were used in June 2017 by the correspondent of the rus.err.ee portal in the Department of Statistics.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has decreased and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
For example, the foreign tour increased by 7.3 per cent (544) to 7,994 tourists in June.
The number of local tourists fell by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The region ' s most marked increase in the number of Russian tourists was 8.9 per cent, or 318 per cent, compared with June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,885 Russian guests stayed at Ida-Viruma hotels.
Andrei Malakov made it clear to worshipers who were responsible for his departure
Andrei Malakov hinted to his worshipers at Instagram who was guilty of his withdrawal from the First Channel.
So far he has not commented on the rumours, but today he has posted a piece of a newspaper article of 1 August.
The photograph of Malakov is signed by a "milk boss" tag.
Article on how to prevent the employee's “burning” and to pay attention to his or her condition.
When we recall the numerous reports that the conductor was unable to find a common language with a newcomer who started to re-formatting "Let's speak," it becomes clear what he had so transparently hinted at, he writes, "CP".
The TV broadcaster, Andrei Malakov, was reportedly on leave and did not sign the application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation of dismissal can be clarified in the coming days.
Five soldiers were killed in an explosion in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers died in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, transmitting to RIA Novosti.
According to the police, a mined vehicle exploded the night before the military roadblock in the Girishk county.
We know of 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new CP occurred in Giryske.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The exchange of fire between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver made a video of a shark bitten by his camera.
Dyver and researcher Greg Scomal made a video of a shark that bit his GoPro acting camera.
The U.S. Maritime Fisheries Agency unit in Massachusetts, which is staffed by Scomal, was placed on Facebook.
On 2 August, the incident took place off the coast of Cape Cod in the north-east of the United States, clarifying the Necn portal.
The man tried to take the shark off the camera held on a special stick during the underwater voyage.
After seeing a man over three meters long, the animal came to him.
Shark started to bite the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
Somal explained that the predator had done the same to determine if he had eaten the food.
The researcher added that the shark could easily have destroyed the instrument.
He also noted that the same behavior of the marine animal had turned out to be new to scientists.
The cause of mass fighting in the Arab military centre has become known.
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Centre, where a mass fighting took place, to investigate the incident.
Some details of this scourge have already come to light.
According to Mash, which appeared on the Vkontakte page, contractors from the Ural military section, No. 31612, were fiercely beaten because of an untapped bed.
It all started when a private named Sayan demonically ignored an officer's order to refuel the sheets.
The officer was joined by soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
Within half an hour, 140 young boys were beaten in a barracks of beds and shells, and glass was broken.
More than ten people were injured in the fight.
Information on the harassment was denied in the CSO.
The study revealed that at least one fifth of the U.S. passengers were carrying prohibited items to an aircraft.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited items on board aircraft at the U.S. Transport Security Administration's inspection sites, including at least 6 per cent on the plane, without regard for prohibited knives or other sharp items.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had by chance carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., which covered more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more likely to violate regulations.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately attempted to fly with something prohibited by the ATB, 19.7 per cent were Millenials, compared with less than 15 per cent of the X-generation.
The most common way to pass ATB staff is to deliver food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that sharp objects had been specially carried out through the search, while 2.2 per cent of women respondents and 3.7 per cent of men respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried illicit drugs to the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country in order to find out how many of them had accidentally been smuggled through airport searches and how many had deliberately done so.
It is expected that most often, consciously or unconsciously, smuggling is carried out through search by those who fly the most.
According to the company, the rules of the ATB are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry or how much.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ABB selects are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ABB could be considered prohibited from entering a book.
Liquids are permitted on inland flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Pruitte abandons the intention to postpone implementation of Obama's emission reduction regulations
The day after the 15-state claim, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama ' s regulations to reduce emissions of air-polluting substances leading to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision that his agency was now more responsive than in previous administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not mention a claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute took place around the 1 October deadline to which the States should ensure compliance with the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would defer their compliance for one year in order to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid “dissatisfaction with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, who, before President Trump was appointed to his current position, was the Attorney General of Oklahoma, was long known as a consistent opposition to the tightening of environmental standards.
Following his transfer to Washington, D.C., he repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms that opposed the chemical or gas-oil industry.
An unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the Puitt policy to revert to the old rules.
Last month the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the head of EPA had exceeded its authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama Administration ' s rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the diversion of methane.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by cutting back on ozone standards, he simply met the obligation of EPA to cooperate with the states in an integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“In previous administrations, EPAs were often unable to meet the target date, then waited for claims from groups of activists and others, and discussed the time frame during the settlement of the case,” said Prüitt, who had filed more than a dozen claims against EPA at his previous post.
“We don't believe in regulation through trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our charter and the authority it gives us.”
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point use his “authorities for the postponement and other powers given by law” once again to ensure that the rules of “jucyjdfys are clear and available”.
The Republicans in Congress are insisting on a broader revision of the ozone regulations.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The Attorney General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that had filed a claim against the EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue with legal pressure.
"The change in EPA -- after our claims -- is an important victory in the fight for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the power of their cities," said Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., and D.C. joined New York.
Ozone occurs at the ground level when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries and chemical and other sources react to sunlight.
The resulting ability to breathe can cause serious respiratory problems for those who are sensitive to it, causing thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environmental defenders welcomed the sudden change in the Pruitt course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the man who is responsible for protecting the air that we breathe," said Laurie Ann Bird of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute the air and their particular interests.”
IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
Congress of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations (IAAF) voted in favour of extending the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
In this way, Congress supported the IAAF Council for the Reconstruction of WFLA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be maintained.
In favour of the extension of the suspension, 166 people voted against 21 and handed over the TASS.
The IAAF Board's report stated that WFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the membership restoration board, but that those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Because of the disqualifying of WFLA at the London Peace Championship, Russian athletes were forced to act under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 persons admitted to IAAF.
The WFLA was permanently disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
The report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent expert, Dick Pawn, was published, describing numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
For details on the latest report of the IAAF Board, please read "IAAF has extended the sanctions against WFLA".
Both defeats
Within the framework of the 3 Russian Fonbet-Prime tour of the PFL teams, the New-Oskovi Chemik held a retreat against the FK Kaluga.
A little over 10 days ago, rivals played each other in a Russian cup, but this time the painting was completely different.
Chemist didn't give up on anything to the opponent, but the second-second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a faasco.
After a recent hit by a Christmas tree at 0:3 p.m., many predicted the easy victory of their masters.
However, since the start of the meeting, the newcomers have forced themselves to be considered and acted from the defence but from the position of the force.
In the 1st time, they built more and had the advantage of mastering the ball.
Alexei Sirotin played another very high-quality match, which repeatedly reflected the dangerous blows and gave the partners confidence in his actions.
Unfortunately, the attack on Chemik lacked the effort and the luck to put the Kaluga defense in an impasse and to kill the first one on the exit.
Following the break, the game began to take place in a meeting course.
The Neumoscows got more involved in the attack.
An alarming call to our team was a defense error, which allowed the natives to create a series of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemik seized the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the cradles played a role -- they spent their time in a more accurate and cold-blooded way, waiting for their time to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, Chemik transferred the ball to the corner, the pitch of which the owners of the fields were transferred without resistance to the gate.
Yuri Dubrowin was the author of the goal.
In the reporting meeting, Chemik demonstrated a good game, but he suffered a beating.
Our team is awaiting another exit, on 11 August at 19 p.m. in Moscow, at the Torpedo Stadium, by Edward Stretz, the newcomers will fight against the headquarters of the CC "Ararat" group, which is composed of Roman Pauluchenko, Marat Izmaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support the Chemist!
Place and time of the meeting of the Newcomers: 6.30 p.m. near the Magguliya store (East, D.2, Corp.
Chemical composition: Sirotin, Manochin (k), Romachenko, Shayunov, Homotov, Gogya (Oreskin), Dodayti, Reds, Saints, Belian (Adenows), Andreichenko (Ligin)

According to published phone decryptions, Trump pressed Mexico for payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post published phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone call with the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieta Trump insisted that he stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the planned border wall.
The U.S. President scolded him for speaking publicly against the wall, and according to current information, he was told, "You can't say it to the press."
Trump started his electoral campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia also revealed a hot crossover.
Trump told Turnbull that an agreement requiring the US to accept refugees on their way to Australia was “smoothful”, “disgusting” and “stuff”, and insisted that because of the Obama agreement, he would look like an idiot because he intended to stop moving refugees to the United States.
Trump concluded the conversation by saying to Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of all day”.
The bodies of the martyrs who died in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane belonging to Russia, carrying the bodies of Russians killed in Abkhazia, took off at 8:15 a.m. Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg.
At the end point, the staff of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the City Mayor, will meet at the site and briefed the journalists by the Deputy Minister for Kurots and Tourism, Abkhazia Astamair Ahba.
The Ministry of Health stated earlier that the Government of Abkhazia had borne all the costs involved in bringing bodies back to Russia.
In addition, official Sukhumi intends to compensate the families of the deceased for 500,000 roubles.
According to Akhba, the Abkhaz leadership was willing to pay the relatives of the travelers who had been killed in the bombings and to live in the Republic, but the relatives had sent only their trusts to the local authorities in accordance with established procedures.
On 2 August, at about 4:20 a.m. Moscow time, two explosions occurred in the village of the Primor Gudaut district of the Ministry of Defence missile and artillery weapons, followed by the detonation of large-scale artillery shells and other ammunition.
As a result, the warehouse was set on fire and caused uncontrolled explosions of various modifications.
Two Russian citizens, Helen Polyakov, were killed in 1970 and Elena Timofeev, were born in 1962, who were at rest near a hydrogenous source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to health facilities with injuries of various degrees.
At present, seven people remain in the hospital and the rest are discharged.
A study of Russian influence on American elections will take place by a large jury
The Russia Special Prosecutor, Robert Müller, has convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., which will study Russia’s influence on U.S. presidential elections in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The materials gathered will examine the Special Prosecutor ' s Office and decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The convening of a large jury gives Müller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the subjects of the investigation of the jury panel, which started its work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the son's meeting then, and the candidate for President Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalie Veselnica.
Müller himself had earlier promised to verify the details of this meeting, which took place in June 2016.
They've been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his legal profession.
Trump Jr. had previously told him that he had been waiting for a compromise for the headquarters of the Democratic Republic of the Congo candidate, Hillary Clinton, but that there were no disclosure documents, and the result was adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that Trump, Jr., ' s announcement of a meeting with Veselnitzka, was literally published by Trump.
At the White House, it was clarified that the president had not dictated anything, but merely used his authority, what any father would have done.
Vice Mayor of Pensions has been detained in the workplace
The Deputy Chief of Administration of Penza, Irin Chirshin, is detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee in his/her workplace, reporting to RIA Novosti.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this matter have not yet been received, but the SS press office has assured them that they will soon follow.
There's no comment on what happened at the Pensa mayor's office yet.
Irina Shirshin is one of the five deputy heads of administration of the Pension Authority.
It has been responsible for urban planning and land relations since April 2015.
Before that, she had served for a long time as head of the State Department of the State Department of the Pensen Region.
Irina Shishina raised three minor children, noting that once again, having become a mother a year ago, she had given up her maternity leave and had returned to work.
Of course, there are no spaceships or carrier missiles in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
The installation of Yuri Gagarin's bustle is a tribute to the first person in space.
Unlike Soviet monuments that are being destroyed in some countries, Gagarin's monuments, on the contrary, are “sneaking around the planet”.
In 2012, a monument was set up in Houston, U.S.A., near NASA ' s former headquarters.
In London, a monument to the Royal Observatory was set up to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in Erfut, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
A monument in Carlov Varah, Czech Republic, escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city centre to a square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarina in Riga, a monument to Yurios Gagarinsu appeared.
That's the name of the first astronaut in Latvian, and he looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: activists lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice
Ford Mercury, in 1948, passed by the audience in Monroe, Georgia, and was roaring toward the little Morse Ford bridge.
When a car carrying four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her.
The chief, a middle-aged man wearing a thin striped suit, held up with a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those sitting inside trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger," the man said.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged out of his front seat by the blizzards.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which played on July 22st, was just a performance.
But when Roger's neck was hit with a noose, almost all the viewers actually held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night in 1946 when two black couples, Roger and Dorota Malcam and George and May Murray Dorsey, were lynching.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years, no one has been arrested -- although we see them with us; although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgia Congress who struggles for human rights for the rest of his life.
For him, a play is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the inhabitants of Monroe that injustice has never been redressed.
"We want to investigate, we want to complete, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We cannot move on to healing and reconciliation until we have justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the lynching victims at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI ' s submissions received by E.C. News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of engaging in lynching.
But no one was charged.
Although suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of two related vigilante motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ' s ruling allowed for the first time Black citizens to vote on the primers to be held that summer.
About the same election, according to the FBI, the black user, Roger Malcolm, stabbed Barnett Hester, the white landowner, with a woman in the fight.
Brooks says that according to the rumours of the city, Hester was sleeping with Malcolm Dorota's wife, and that the child she was supposed to give birth was not from her husband.
The FBI reported that on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorota and their cousin May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove from prison and approached the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of vigilantemen surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded Harrison's murders," a report of the FBI concluded.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement agencies, who not only participated in the killings but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt at election rights," he said.
"They were all killed to send a signal to the blacks in the city. If you register and vote, it will be the same with you."
For nearly ten years, Cassandra Green has run an annual play that reproduces the lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visual and captures the viewer and tells of a deep racism that many people would like to see no more in America.
It's hard to see, and it's even more difficult to turn around, but Green thinks that's what's important.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own uglyness," she says.
"But I can't build relationships with you unless you hear me or hear what I've experienced."
This year's performances began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors -- a dozen whites, the rest of them blacks -- gathered in the room and listened to a year-old review of the play.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He's been the main member of the clan for several years, but he says it's never been easier.
"I don't think I got scared because this isn't the man I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
The actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectrum begins by Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife, Dorota, screaming and pushing him.
"I said niga, get out of my house!"
Shouting Rascone back.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all the black actors) gets angry with the homoth.
Green laughs more loud than everybody else.
"What's wrong?" Ascon asks.
He's worried and confused.
Am I winning?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the whites were saying nigga."
Yes yes, one of the black performers laughs.
"You've got to take a hard 'r'."
And energy changes in the room: discomfort changes from a sense of partnership.
Everyone must do the right thing, not only for the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts first.
This time, when Rascon speaks the word "n," it becomes clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The spectrum ends cruelly and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and sings a sad song by Billy Halliday "Strage Friit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
A hundred yards away, half a hundred spectators wipe tears and sweat out their eyes.
Almost equal numbers of blacks and whites are present.
A couple came from Texia, New York, to see the performance; many live in close proximity.
They all suffered for almost eight hours the heavy spirit of Georgia while Brooks took them to the tombs of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, killings have been only a story, but now that they are standing in the same place where people have lynched, it seems as if their ghosts are hanging right in the air.
When the last note of the song subsides, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend to their heads, touch blood paint and fixed bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy barks, as if to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
Actors shed ropes from their necks and wipe out tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, the man in the suit who played the top dollclan.
Nick Rascon embraces two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms — the emotional load of the play finally hit him.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had reasons for this."
Later, the audience goes to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are lively in discussing a performance with the black couple they just met.
Denise Daplinski is struggling to find words to describe what she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to these terrible, terrible words and actions... of people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now is it called what the police shoots."
In another corner of the room, Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender at food, took the general interest.
He said he was already planning next year's presentation.
"The program is encouraging to us because it not only describes the horrors of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he said.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are condemned to repeat it.”
The Court fined Navovny for violations on the “agitation Saturday”
The Simon court of Moscow fined Alexei Nvali for breaking the organization of the rally.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20, paragraph 8, of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, Judge Hizir Musakaev of the Simon Court of Justice of Moscow had completed the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of staff of the opposition Alexei Nvali, who had been prosecuted under the same article as Navny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the “agitation Saturday”, which was conducted in Moscow from 8 to 9 July by Navoval's supporters.
Upon seeing the aggit material, the officers who monitored the participants on the Sabbath believed that the organizers of the event had deliberately concealed its true nature, a public action (which required prior authorization from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazouev requested the suspension of administrative proceedings due to the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had made certain mistakes in drafting the protocol.
Volkov was not detained on the very “aggression Saturday” but received a summons requiring him to appear at the police station to report the event with his active participation.
The same agendas were received by Nawany himself and another opponent, Nicolai Liaskin.
In Mordovia, a bride and three wedding guests were arrested
The Mordovia court arrested a local resident who had shot four people, including a bride, at the wedding.
This has been reported to the Republic Directorate of the Investigation Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 July.
During the fight, a 42-year-old citizen of Saransk fired several shots at the guests who had come to the village pond to dig.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code (“Hooliganism”), article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraph 3 (a), (e), and (and) of article 105, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code (“Trying to kill two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner for hooligan motives”).
According to Interfax, the local media reported that the man had opened fire because the wedding guests decided to dig through the area of his section to the water.
Minenergo will tighten the requirements for power-fired turbine suppliers
The Ministry of Energy will update rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment such as turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines are launched, the power plant turbine, oil pumping facilities and the production of equipment suppliers will be required to share data on access with the Minenergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The Government's draft decree is ready and has been presented for public discussion.
New requirements will apply only to “critically important energy equipment” to Russia.
The potential threats in the document include obtaining information and access to management by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unfair partners and hackers.
The European Union has expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The European Union Press Service stated on 4 August that the anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded because of the scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens to Crimea.
This has been reported earlier by the "Arrangements of the Week".
The EU Council Press Service stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been expanded owing to a scandal with Siemens, which had allegedly been delivered to Crimea, circumventing the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries for the expansion of anti-Russian sanctions.
It had previously been reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the current day, and the decision had been taken, and sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Pearson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British education group Pearson announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the preliminary dividends by 72 per cent in connection with the launching of another restructuring programme aimed at addressing the problems faced by their businesses.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fallon, head of the company, will take place mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019, take place in addition to the 4,000 jobs reduced during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it was planning to reduce the cost of another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May during the third cost-cutting programme to try to bring back to life a business that was hit by a rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its forecasts for a year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 per cent increase in sales of the basic commodity in the first half of the year to £2.5 billion.
Attack on the convoy in Kabul: Nato soldiers killed in the suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as reported by NATO.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the Karabah incident.
This explosion was the last of the massacres that hit Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO reported that the explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a “man-portable improvised explosive device”.
All the wounded are reported to be in stable condition and receiving treatment at the American military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces located near Bagram.
According to UN reports, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017, and about 20 per cent were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb attack on a car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban stated that they had attacked.
On 31 May, a strong explosion in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people — the most serious death toll in the country since the United States-led troops suspended the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence highlights the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump estimates whether there is a need to increase the number of U.S. military forces providing military and police assistance in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its lines of conduct and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cancelled the decision to postpone the adoption of Obama ' s law that states should limit air-pollution emissions the day after 15 states had sued the agency for this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “Olyses 2015” measurements, stressing that this step is an indication of the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the States.
“We believe in and respond to the dialogue with our state partners”, said Scott Pruitte, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone the measurements of ozone, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced to meet higher air purity standards for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, joined the Federal District of Colombia in a suit claiming that the intention was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental regulations introduced by the previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader programme aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has led to resistance from democracies and naturalist organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website says that the use of ozone-containing air “can reduce the function of lungs and increase respiratory symptoms, ” such as asthma.
The Association of European Business was opposed to new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with the US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement stated that business was an important link between countries and people, so free trade could not be restricted.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that allows for the separation of business from politics and the finding of a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
The officers ask the police to limit the movement on the coast of Psovo.
The Pskov People's Elects addressed the head of the UMVD to the town of Sergey Surin on the problem of movement on the Great Coastal River.
The haughtiness of Constantine Bolotin, Gregory of Obendenkov, and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, driver control would help to make the territory safer and more secure.
The problem is that the violators ignore the Pedestrian track signs and drive freely along the coast.
Major repairs and improvements have been made for nothing.
Sports and playgrounds are getting uncomfortable with cars.
According to the Pskov News Agency, at evenings, the central coastal patrol is conducted by the PPP motorist and his wife.
They reduce the number of cars passing, but they do not stop driving completely.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to remove the hard drives
President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation suggested that investigative authorities should be prohibited from removing servers and hard drives from the workplaces.
This was stated by the Head of State at the meeting on investment development programmes in the Far East.
According to the President, “the use of measures for the purpose of investigation leading to the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from computers and servers” should be deleted.
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, “it is sufficient to remove copies, assure them and use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that it was not possible “to create conditions that prevented the business from continuing until taxes could be paid”.
Olga Bosová told me how much she wanted to call her ex-wife.
Olga Bouzová, a television columnist, confessed that she was eager to call the former football husband, Dimitri Tarasov.
At the moment, the famous is in the U.S., where he deals with business matters.
Just the day before Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on the Instagram social network.
She reported that she had not married, taken any new tattoos, or named her ex-wife, saying that he had ruined her life, although she was eager to do so.
Bouzova said he'd remember this trip forever, because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played magic Minister Cornelius Fudge in the display of the Harry Potter novel series, died at 92 years of age.
That's what The Independent reported on Thursday.
His family told him about the actor's death.
According to them, he lived "a life of great success in film, theater and television in his 70 years of career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort city of Cheltnem.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theater, he played with Lawrence Olivier on "Coriolan Trajeda."
Hardy also remembered the repeated roles played by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agatha Christi's screens on Miss Marshal.
He was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Awards for his role as Churchill on BBC's "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981).
Robert Hardy also had to serve as U.S. president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
There was something in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and actually Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with his royal wife, Queen Margrethe.
It's a golden wedding this year, but the couple's agenda is not about preparing for a celebration, but about a huge dispute.
His Highness had relinquished the title of Prince Consortium, and he said to the queen that he had never had the title of King Consortium reviled him.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains the queen's official wife.
Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on Washington to stop grafting Moscow.
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Mike Pens, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans, responded.
The relevant statement was circulated by the foreign policy agency some time ago.
In its commentary, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the United States is increasingly using cold war images that are inadequately modernized.
In addition, Russian diplomats have called upon the United States authorities to stop the flogging of the Russian Federation.
According to the Week before, U.S. Vice-President Mike Pens accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the western Balkans and of organizing a failed coup d'état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasili Lomachenko are meeting for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive match.
Vasili Lomachenko and Mike Garcia, who appear to be moving steadily towards the most exciting boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN Canal in Los Angeles, until Garcia, an unconquered champion in the light weight of the World Boxing Council, went down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, a World Boxing Organization champion in the second half weight.
Following the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former World Champion in the four weight categories by Erian Broner on Saturday, both boxers are in the top five boxers regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck with that."
Lomachenko defends his belt in conjunction with Miguel Marriga on Saturday at seven o'clock in the evening on ESPN.
When the boxers called for the photo, the manager, Lomachenko Egis Climas, noticed that a potential decisive battle between them would have been the first time.
"I used to be half-weighted," said Garcia.
"I've come up for Broner's sake [to £144], but I'm not that big.
I'm not enough for 140.
I want to go down to the semicircuit.
And he needs to get up to half a pound [135 lb], and then we'll have a match.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give them this.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"Box needs this match."
Climas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of the strategy he was following that Lomachenko should carry out his debut battle in the weight of 135 later this year to appoint for the next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0.30 knockouts) who would also be interested in fighting against the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luc Campbell after their battle for the title of the light-weight world champion in the Forum arena on 23 September.
“The fight can be on PPV because all the fans have asked for it,” said Garcia, expressing his willingness to fight later on the channel that will offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names would be of such interest.
As soon as they're ready...
Garcia said he thought Lomachenko was a "extreme boxer" and might visit him on Saturday.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately give Garcia praise and said that he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you were on a knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on showing the force of the impact and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension growing in front of their own team.
“This battle must take place.
No other fight is so interesting and so much to talk about.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for one of the fat boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great battle.”
On several central streets, Moscow will stop traffic for the weekend.
On this weekend, 5 and 6 August, the movement will be restricted in the capital at Tver Street from the Nastasin Lane to the Triumph Square, as well as on the 1st Tver Street.
In addition, the trip will be closed on the Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tver Man Street.
At all sites, the overlap will operate on both lanes, reporting to the Information Centre of the Moscow Department of Transport.
The streets will be closed from midnight on 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August for improvement.
Also on weekends, traffic will be closed at the Moscow Coastal Section.
The park is still under construction.
Putin instructed the Attorney General's Office to verify Baikal
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, instructed the Office of the Attorney-General of the Russian Federation to conduct an inspection of the territory of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“Please request the Office of the Attorney-General to verify the Baikal territory with regard to illegal and environmentally harmful activities”, said Vladimir Putin at the meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested that measures be taken if violations were to be found.
New results of testing for the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of asylum-seekers tests in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of age, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Agency of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age of asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for not being able to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing and the forensic medical agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were assessed as being 18 or older, and in 25 other cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency estimated that the tested person “is likely to be 18 years of age or older”.
In 432 cases, the opinion stated that a person “is likely to be less than 18”.
Tests are carried out only when the age of the person is in doubt.
According to Johan Goransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with the results of past months.
“We don't see much difference with the statistics of past months, the numbers are quite appropriate”, he said on the portal ‘The Local.'
The high percentage of cases in which people were rated as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “most likely the age of the test is 18 years or more”.
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a public statement had been made that 18 was being fulfilled this year.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of age, which is to X-ray the teeth of wisdom and tomography of the knee joints and to give them to dentists and radiologists, has also led to criticism in some authorities.
One of the sceptics is an endocrinologist at the Karolin Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have gone through puberty before or after normal.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I don't think I should use the measurement methods that are being used.
The biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can't define it with confidence, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he said to the newspaper Metro.
However, Goeransen, of the Forensic Medicine Agency, said in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, the risk of mistaking a child for an adult child can be said.
We face the greatest risk when a person will soon be 18 and then about 10 per cent.”
I'll see if I can run for president.
During a working visit to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was willing to consider whether he would run for the presidency of the Russian Federation in 2018 and would pass the Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request of the inhabitants of the village of Tormuška in the province of Buryat.
During a video conference on fire management in Buryatia and Irkutsk, the interviewer addressed Putin, saying, "Vladimir Vladimirovic, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election comes, we all ask you to run for that office again."
"All right, I'll think about it, thank you," said the president.
On 28 July, President Dimitri Peskov, the spokesman of the Russian Federation, commented on comments by some media that Vladimir Putin's electoral headquarters would be headed by the head of the administration of President Anton Vaino.
The sands called these assumptions "unfounded, hypothetical reasonings".
"Until no headquarters, before the establishment of headquarters far, before the election campaign far," said Peskov.
"Not until it's on the agenda," said Sandy.
The Governor of West Virginia stated that he was moving to another party.
The Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justice, announced Thursday during a meeting with President Trump, who is moving into another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the democracies have drifted away from me,” said Governor Justice.
“I am speaking today with many prayers and many reflections... today I am telling you, the people of West Virginia, that I can no longer be of use to you as governor-democracy.”
The rally blew up with applause.
“That's why tomorrow I'm going to change my registration to a Republican,” Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play differently."
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won a 42 per cent victory in West Virginia, and Justice did not support a candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited a coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement Thursday evening that “The transition of Governor Justice to another party is another blow against the Democratic Party, which is more likely to interfere than working to make our country big again”.
“Taking into account only 15 governors and controlling the lowest number of state legislatures in history, the Governor’s statement of Justice is just another renunciation of the party, which has no leaders from the top and is unable to find a positive, unifying message”, reported a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDeniel.
The cat's name was Mr. Beauty. He found the house thanks to the social media.
A pilot in Pittsborough, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat named Mr. Beauty who weighed more than 20 pounds [14 kg] after becoming famous over the Internet.
This is reported by the Mashable.
At the end of June, on Facebook, a picture of a cat was published asking him to find his owner because "he was obviously fed by someone before."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of an animal’s face could become a new memorial.
The publication received more than 3,000 swearers and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people have expressed the wish to welcome Mr. Beauty.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazi (Angela Fraze), who promised to do more.
In a WNCN radio interview, an American woman said that she had had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms and now weighs just over five pounds.
In July, Reddit drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
Over 68,000 views of the animal were collected by the post with a picture of the animal.
The commentators noted that she might well have a career in model business.
Kou commended Russia's “exclusive” apology for the Doping scandal.
An international expert on the easy athletics Sebastian Cowe commended Thursday for what he called sincere apology from Russia for the Doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not a good time to allow the country to participate again in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Lung Athletics, Dimitri Puttin, reported at the Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations, which had been held the day before the light athleteship championship, that his country's removal from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes whose gold and silver medals were stolen in the competition”.
Despite his comments, Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations voted in favour of maintaining the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of State-funded doping.
“I felt that today’s response, today’s report was very sincere,” said the President of the International Association of Athletic Federations, Koe.
“All the council and Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself recognized that it had experienced extremely hot times and was now doing its best to see to it that the federation had been restructured.”
Kow said that he also “beloved” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reconstruction.
“I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that this is not the time to restore Russia to its rights,” said Koe.
“In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tarnished system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, in line with the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, will participate under neutral flag in the World Light Athletic Championship, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met in order to rebuild Russia.
According to his report to reporters in London, following a report on the Council of the International Association of Athletic Federations, drug testing is still not done in sufficient volume, and isolated coaches are still doing their job peacefully.
The Court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of conversion
Detained by the Ukrainian Security Service (SSA), journalist Vasili Muravitsky is arrested for two months and handed over to SU.
An Internet official, Journal Gitomira, is suspected of treason by placing his publications on Russian websites and attacking Ukraine's territorial integrity.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering this to be a “barbar policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
A commanding vessel, Commander Borsini, entered Libya's territorial waters to stop the flow of illegal migrants, along with its Navy.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed to it with the internationally recognized Libyan Government, which does not, however, control most of the country ' s territory.
The opposition cabinet and the Tobruk-based Libyan parliament accused Italy of violating Libya ' s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they claimed not to believe these threats and intend to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in the talks of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Head of the European-recognized Libyan Cabinet, Faiza Saraj.
The Italian authorities launched a maritime mission to combat illegal migration following the release in July of statistics on the number of illegals entering the country from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
The big-scale crash occurred in Skype
A global failure in Skype service was recorded today in several countries around the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began sending complaints to the programme developers.
In Microsoft, it was stressed that experts were already working actively to address the problems faced by Europeans and North Americans, and that RIA “News” was being clarified.
Remember, in June of this year Skype also happened.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
The two leaders of the assembled Ukraine for light athletics were suspended from participating in the FM
Olga Landska and Olice Povoch, specializing in the short run, are excluded from the assembly Ukraine at the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on on the website of the Federation of Light Athletics of the Country (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the executive committee in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings by the International Association of Lung Federations (IAAF).
Co-worker Sergey Bassenko was also expelled from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Spartena, IAAF suspects athletes use doping.
Powkh is the Bronze Pier of the Olympics (2012) and World Cup 2011 and the European 2010 Championship of the Estaphet 4-100 metres, and the Lander of the European Firsts 2012 at the Estaphet 4-400 metres.
The World Light Athletic Championship in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neimar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited waste by European football clubs would not prevent the world-class transfer of Neimar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Parry St. German.
Whatever the consequences may be, there may be further along the chain, for Parry St. German, by UEFA, the governing body in charge of European football, in whose authorities prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious champion League tournament.
It follows from the Financial Fair Plei rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, that SFW will eventually have to show that Neimar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid Euro222 million ($262 million) to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neimar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
These are some of the financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
The SPLM can certainly crack to hire Neimar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach a profitability threshold in their football business.
FFK introduced Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
A former French football player believed that clubs that went into huge debt in their quest for success were basically cheating and risking destruction if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FPF stopped focusing on club debt and instead switched to tracking its losses.
As a result of this change in the business model originally used by Roman Abrahamovich in Chelsea in 2003, buying a club with good potential and then seriously spending to improve the team and create a global brand has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year assessment period, which takes over 2018, clubs may suffer losses of Euro30 million.
And despite the shameful removal of Plato from the presidency in 2015, his successor to WEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive expenditure.
“I think FFG is alive, and we are moving forward to tighten the rules”, said Andrea Traverso, an Associated Press agency that controls FFG in UEFA last week.
Although SPM would pay for the purchase of Neimar's contract on a one-time basis, it could report on this amount for the duration of its contract.
Neimar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be reported annually as a cost of Euro44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFG sanctions in 2014, the heavy sanctions imposed on SAF and the Abu Dhabi Manchester City were imposed on the Abu Dhabi.
SWW was fined 60 million euros (at the rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and it was ordered to limit the composition of its team to the Champion League during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the normal 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that can attempt to outstretch its financial inspections by destroying their income from companies associated with the owners of the club.
Even though the Qatari company could have sponsored SWW, if the amount of funding was considered to be higher than the standard market rate, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority had been scattered.
It was reported that part of Neimar's earnings in SPLM could have been paid by the organization committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But SUS and Qatar 2022 deny that Neimar will be the Ambassador of the World Championship, and such a manoeuvre could easily have been discovered by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on SPLM mean that UEFA will be even more careful to monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by those familiar with the situation, UEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with SPM regarding the transfer of Neimar.
They contacted Associated Press on an anonymous basis, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, SWD earned more than Euro10 million in turnover of Euro542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
SWG expects that Neimar's arrival will be a favourable ground for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attributes and T-shirts with a team logo.
At the club, it is expected that the increase will be at least 30 per cent due to the recruitment of a new player.
Undeniably angry with the fact that one of the best football players was leaving, the Spanish League tried to prevent the transfer of Neimar by claiming that SPL would violate the financial “fair-fire”.
“This is an obvious case of financial doping, with a club and State”, said the Spanish newspaper “AS” to President La League Javier Tebas, meaning that Qatar is the ultimate owner of SWD.
Arsenala coach Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnet, shares La League's doubts about the financing of the club by the State.
“It's all the consequences of equity participation, and it's completely changed the landscape of football over the last 15 years,” said Wenger on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is becoming very difficult to comply with the financial fair plai, because there are many ways and many reasons for a country to be represented by such a serious player.
Orders and places of oaths will be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President will determine such amendments to the second reading to the relevant law, and have drafted a committee of States on the law and the State.
A week ago, deputies planned to determine directly the order of the oath in the law.
Children under 18 years of age, as well as incapacity, will be released from the solemn oath, followed by the finalized text of amendments to the draft law on the nationality of the Russian Federation (which is available to the “Report”), which the committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of taking an oath at the time of accession to Russian citizenship, instead of formally signing documents, was supported by President Vladimir Putin on 6 June during a meeting with Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
Member States have formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading to the draft law abolishing the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, for public incitement to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 205.2, para. 2, of the Criminal Code) as well as for hijacking an aircraft, train or water transport, but only for acts related to terrorism (art. 211, para. 4, of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, the logic of the bill is that by making documents for citizenship, a person is signed on the promise to comply with Russian law - on the path of extremism - he is in violation of that promise.
The draft law was introduced into the State in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev (“One Russia”), Gennady Zuganov (PRPF), Vladimir Zyrinowski (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (“The Just Russia”) and the Speaker of the DG Vyacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, he was received by the deputies on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State and Law approved the second reading text of the draft law, but it has now been re-examined.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will establish the order of oaths.
Previously, parliamentarians had intended to describe the procedure directly in the Law on the Nationality of the Russian Federation, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere before the State emblem and the flag of the Russian Federation in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place, a list of the places where the Herb of the Russian Federation could be located, was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of government of entities, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, they could have been the U.S.
A solemn oath of allegiance to the Russian Federation will be made after officials have checked their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be issued after the oath of oaths has been made from the finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should be preceded by the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in by 18 years, not 14 years old.
There is still a rule by which incapacity or limited capacity, as well as those unable to deliver, read or hand-writtenly sign the text of the oath, will be exempted from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release “other persons” from this procedure,
The updated bill also provides for a special procedure for the admission to Russian citizens of Ukraine who are considered to be Russian speakers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by making an application to the competent authority of Ukraine.
Notarized copies of the statement will have to be transmitted to Russian officials.
The waiver of “other” nationality, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the control of the individual”.
A group of deputies proposed an amendment to the law, including the first Vice-President, DG Ivan Melnikov (PRPF), Natalia Polonsky, Pavel Krashennikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all “One Russia”).
I think many of you know that it is impossible to obtain a certificate from Ukraine.
Accordingly, a very large number of people are awaiting a solution to their fate with regard to the citizenship of the Russian Federation,” explained Paul Krashennikov (ER) head of the Duma Committee on State and Law the previous day.
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on certain posts for foreigners would not apply to those who had in writing refused “other” nationality and had submitted their previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs but who, “for reasons beyond their control”, had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from taking office in the municipal service, from being employed for facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual nationality or a residence permit may not become a member of the State of the Federation or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on 1 September 2017 and that the necessary secondary legislation should be ready at that time.
Nostalgia is becoming a niche in the U.S. Star and the Warp Detective.
The current theory of nostalgically reminds at the same time of the famous days of the figures in the 1980s; the era of the Grande in the 1990s (about the time when eminent Masters David Wayne and Michael Schovother made a comedy of the "State" for the MTV); and themselves, that is, the year 2001, before her stars, Elizabeth Banks, Amy Pauler and Paul Radd, moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the exaltation and realization of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, she seems anachronistic.
The first day of the camp was surprisingly good, not only because of absurd humor (including the original story of a talking can of vegetables by H. John Benjamin).
The result is doubling the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached the age of majority; this makes it impossible for them to return to it part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults have played adults, they have less emotional roots, and their parody is more unsystemic, and includes reefs from the steel films of the 1990s, such as "Rooks rolling the cradle."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled skates and "a lot of other things since 1991."
Many of the pictorial moves are the same.
Good - natured Coop, now a writer, has not yet gained reciprocity from Cathy (Marguerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still virgin.
And there's a mad and mean conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (so Schowolter) is now instigated by George Bush Older (a tried parody in the execution of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of a franchise is the retreat from it.
It's especially fun to see young Radd singing Matt Dillon's song from One-Eyed, whose character Andy's former big man looks like an old man now.
This franchise could have been successful if it had been an occasional madness in the spirit of the "Seven Up" recursion, until it reached what I thought would be its logical conclusion: "A Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the last scene the whole company would have gone to the movie's premier movie, "A Mountain American Summer."
In the Amazon, comrade Detective refers to another type of nostalgia: the memory of the cold war from the "Americans", the "Blonde Explosive" or even the "Blake" with its images of the East and West struggles.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with director Riz Thomas, depicts a television film: the 1980s Romanian police drama about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Lenin road.
The main roles - which Gregor saw and idealist Josef - are played by Florin Pierrek Jr. and Cornelio Ulic, and their dialogues were in English by Chenning Tatum (e.g. executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Lavit.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (policemen spend time watching chess games, how Americans can watch football).
A team of famous frame-by-frame votes -- among them Jenny Slatt, Nick Offferman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigna -- makes it interesting to play "Audience Voice."
But comrade Detective is holding on so much to the possibility of a glamorous propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are prolonged, and fun isn't too often.
If it were to be made shorter, the "Command Detective" could better cope with its satire in the spirit of agitpropa; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, two fat men were sitting in the lobby eating up a bunch of hamburgers.
This image tells the imaginary Communist viewer that Western culture can do anything to overrun it.
The fictional Romanian authors are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them.
The Spartacus and Locomotive Superb Cup for Russia will be about 30 million roubles between Spartacus and Locomotive.
This was reported by the President of the Russian football premier League (PFL), Sergei Prwkin, at a press conference.
According to the chapter of the RFF, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that so far there had been little left for the match.
The Spartacus-Locomotiv will be held on Friday, 14 July, at 9:30 a.m.
TASS notes that Spartacus is an active champion of the Russian Federation and Locomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young U.S. U.S. U.S. U.
A 37-year-old U.S. official with a furniture firm had contacted the police the other day.
The man claimed to steal expensive tools from the shop, causing serious damage to his production.
The thieves ’ prey has become tools worth almost 200,000 roubles: two welds, a perforator, a hydraulics, and a swan.
The security guards began to search for the criminals and soon went out to the inhabitants of the Bashcortostan region, a region where they were 23 and 24 years old.
According to the media service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, accomplices entered the enterprise, broke the entrance door and removed the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold stolen equipment to the first hit car service.
They had already been prosecuted for theft and law enforcement officials had been able to return only part of the stolen instruments to their rightful owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's comments on the relations between the Russian Federation and the United States.
The US and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State of Heather Nauert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dimitri Medvedev, concerning the relations of the two States.
The head of the Russian Government stated earlier that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the Russian Federation a fully valued trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were at a “low level”, but noted that it was necessary to seek “areas for interaction”.
"Look at the truce in south-west Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," says RIA News diplomat.
At the same time, a representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The draft law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK, President Donald Trump of the United States, signed on the previous Wednesday.
In doing so, he acknowledged that the document was unsuccessful and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior grew rose from amethysts and quartz
The jubilant unit of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - added to the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They've got five new rings and three pickles on the barbed tapes.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line produced two new rings and a coulomb of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds made in glyptic technology (hand-cut stone) and respect for the 70th anniversary of the home.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellán was inspired by the roses that had grown in his home in Granville by a modeler, Christian Dior, and the Paris gardens of the Larger and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found the perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump strongly criticized Congressers.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, the same people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
On the previous day, Donald Trump had signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
These include Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House issued a presidential statement stating that the law would not allow the US to enter into beneficial transactions and would bring the Russian Federation, China and North Korea closer together.
The Belarusian businessman refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
Viktor Prokokena, a Belarusian businessman, withdrew a request from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to purchase a Sberbank subsidiary.
The businessman explained his decision to the RBC to “concentrate on other of our planned investments and projects on which we are working”.
According to Mr. Prokogeni, such a move would be “a better investment of time” despite the investment attraction of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main applicant for the purchase of a unit of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the Norvik Bank Grygoriya Guselnik and of the Belarusian company Said Guceriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Peter Poroshenko, imposed sanctions on their daughter structures in March.
One such financial organization, other than WTB and Wneconombank, became Sberbank.
The new man named the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
At the Ministry of Energy, the Russian Federation named the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Nowak, made an explanation of the incident.
He said that the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in the Krasnodar province.
The vehicle in the accident hit the transmission lines, and the Cuban and associated Crimean networks were shut down.
Power failures in the major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The experts resolved the problems within a few hours.
It was initially reported that an abnormal heat could have been the cause of the blackout.
The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25 per cent interest rate
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and declining inflation have reduced rumours of possible increases.
The Bank of England had warned that economic growth would remain inactive and had left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressures on family incomes.
The Bank ' s Committee for Monetary Policy (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to maintain the rates of 0.25 per cent, with fewer committee members voting this month for an increase in the rate, as weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank had warned that higher rates would be necessary in the next few years to control brexitary inflation and had stated that borrowing costs were likely to rise stronger than expected in financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted in favour of abandoning part of the huge economic development package launched one year ago by brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency funding plan for which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it reported that it was now expected to provide an additional £15 billion — up to £115 billion.
In the rate decision protocol, the bank said: “In accordance with MPC’s main projections, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) will soon remain slow, while pressure on real family income continues to influence consumption”.
With regard to the question of rates, he reiterated that “some tightening of financial policies” “a little more” than markets expected would be required to halt inflation.
The markets now predict the first increase in the third quarter of the following year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all the promotions would be “step-by-step” and “limited”.
Bank forecasts for this and next year ' s promotions are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank maintained its forecast of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After these news reports, the shearing fell in relation to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth rates had weakened the higher expectations; GDP had risen by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the bank representative, the growth appears to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank ' s latest report on inflation has given little reason for joy to households, which have been affected by high inflation and very little wage increases: the bank says that pressure will increase before it decreases.
The Bank added that the financial policy “could not prevent” success in the next few years, but expected that “significantly” salaries would be restored by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also oriented towards growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods resulting from the low pound rate, which offsets some of the reduced consumption costs.
The decision was taken one year after the rate had been reduced to 0.25 per cent last August following the shocking results of the referendum on the European Union withdrawal that led to the pound falling.
The bank estimates that it will take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision on the rates, there was a noise around the anticipated increase in the rates, as inflation increasingly put pressure on the already under pressure from households: three members of the committee were asked to raise the rates to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation dropped to 2.6 per cent last month, from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the fall was expected and that it was being compensated again in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher rate than the projected 2 per cent is the result of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco’s mortgage brokers, said: “If you consider the recent drop in swap courses, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as creditors demand business opportunities and expect a good year’s end.
The market is particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, as the refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of absence of a commission, as well as at a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
The public health service will prescribe HIV-provoking drug for 10,000 people
Since September, patients will have access to a post-war “revolutionary” HIV prevention drug in the High Court for funding a drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-conspiracy prevention of HIV (PREP), a drug taken before sex, has been proven to reduce the risk of infection among those at risk by an average of 86 per cent, and will now be provided by the Health Service for an initial three-year probationary period of approximately 10,000 persons.
It agreed to finance the test after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ' s ruling last year, which stated that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay for the PES despite its claim that it should be financed by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was described as “a major innovation” by Simon Stevens, President of the National Health Service of England, and the National AIDS Control Office (NAT) called it “a turning point”.
Before the full launch of the programme across England by April 2018, venereal dispensers in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffilde will be among the first to register people, and more dispensers will join the programme in October.
Preconception prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV drugs that are used to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that PEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When it comes to taking a PEP before sex, there's enough certain drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for treatment include homosexual and bisexual men, transgeners and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispansers will select suitable participants to participate in the study, including men, women, trans-genders and persons whose partners are unknown, whether their HIV status has been hampered by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live and are assigned to a doctor of general practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal dispensary participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England this week, after an international procurement tender, has signed a drug supply contract.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of the EPP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, how it is perceived and how it is used on a large scale.
“This crucial innovation should complement and strengthen broad-based and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Control Agency), stated: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If properly targeted at people in need and at risk, the RES provides an opportunity to change the status of the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at risk for HIV have been able to access a new means of opening up to the National Health Service in England, which, without discussing this with a partner, will improve many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, president of Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first step is to ensure that the test is rapidly deployed throughout the country and that none of the HIV risk groups are forgotten.
Now that we've been provided with a pilot drug, we're going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
The Shadow Minister of People's Health, Sharon Hodgson, said: “We very much welcome the beginning of the PRE test, which was very late for months of delays and delays on the part of the Government.”
Data show how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the transmission of this rock infection.
This test will bring us closer to a full understanding of the benefits of the RES.
It is now important that the test be launched as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those at risk of HIV and to move us forward even further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution on support for the Treaty of Tatar and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WTC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of retaining the office of President in Tatar.
According to the document, the post is “a positively established form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic and expresses the national interests of all the Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatar.
According to the document, it “has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatar and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
We will recall that since 24 July 2007, a treaty between Moscow and Kazanya has been concluded for 10 years.
On 11 July, the President of the Russian Federation was requested to extend the agreement and retain the name of the Head of the Region.
Tatar is now the only federal entity to have a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called “President”.
In Russia, international driving rights have been difficult to obtain
There is a shortage of international driving permits (MLMs) for HBDD units.
To obtain such rights, we have to wait a few weeks to wait, which is a real problem for vacationers wishing to leave abroad on their car or rent it.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains controversial.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs had been introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written on the national certificate because the information was explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in the countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In reality, however, everything depends on a specific police or rental office: some require MLM and others have sufficient national rights.
In order to be safe, drivers of international law are still receiving, but it is worth noting that, in countries that have not ratified the Convention (e.g., the United States, Mexico, Indonesia, Spain), the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with forms in almost all HBDG units, reporting to Commersanta, conducting a study in a number of regions.
In Moscow, for example, there are no signposts in the UGBD units, and the forms are not enough for four months.
You can sign up on the public service website, but the line is already long enough by mid - August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is not possible to obtain the IDP “for technical reasons”, without going into detail, in the Samarsk region, it is honest to say that there are no forms and the situation is similar in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, and there are increasing reports on social media:
Irina Burmister: "Well, guess why in Moscow you can't get international rights."
That's right, because all HYBD's offices have completed their forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "The question of knowledgeable people!"
International rights must be obtained as a matter of urgency.
In Moscow there is always a long way ahead, and there are no stamps on the spot (a button is, but can't give it).
The public service portal would show that Spp time is free to fail.
Has anyone tried to get into another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the requirements for international driving permits have changed, and new forms are being supplied to the units of the State Inspectorate.
This may be the result of a deficit, but it is not clear what the changes are, but it has not been reported earlier.
The blanks are purchased by the Specialized Road Traffic Safety Centre (CEC) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplied to the HYBD.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with the OA “Guard”: nearly 200,000 IDP forms were manufactured in 2014-2015, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded with the OO “First Printing Room” on 18 July for the manufacture of 70,000 forms.
There's a version that the CSN just didn't have time for a tender, which caused a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people have made their own trips to the cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
Which rights are accepted there is not clear enough, so people are being re-insured, and so the demand for international “goats” has arisen.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass an examination to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The new model International driving permit (IDP) has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimea Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia ' s ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
That's what he said in an interview on Friday, 4 August.
No respected international company will even go there because it risks losing its business in the EU, U.S., Japan, countries that have acceded to the sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
"That is, I strongly believe, no prospect for this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he felt that Russia was unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally construct smaller-scale objects.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
“I therefore believe that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so short-sighted to join this project,” the official noted.
On 31 July, the builders completed the build-up of a vehicle arch of the Crimean Bridge.
The Körchen Bank has completed a scaffolding of the road arch of the Crimea Bridge, which will be closed at an altitude of 45 metres from the base of the structure.
“The bridge planners prepared the railway arch for installation on the fairway supports”, reported at the project's information centre.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maxim Soklov, informed the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, that the construction of the site was ahead of schedule.
The Crimea Bridge will connect the Crimea Peninsula and the Krasnodar Land.
In Spain, an official who had not been to work for 10 years was dismissed
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the civil service) was the chief of Spanish official Carlos Recio to have?
The permanent walk lasted 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still dismissed.
But not his direct boss.
Only in the bureaucrat world does it happen.
The people seem to have been used to all the "services of the people" sprees.
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those whose taxes they live well.
This time, sension complained from Spain.
There, Valencia’s archivist, Carles Recio, managed to stay out of work for ten years.
He was paid on a regular basis.
That's all solid, 50,000 euros a year.
And Mr. Recio's "wonderful Times" is over.
He was dismissed by decision of the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
The investigation found that an angry walker went to the office at 7:00 a.m. to register in the electronic system each morning.
And I went home right away.
He appeared again at 4:00 a.m. in the workplace to register again in the system that he had left.
That's it for 10 years.
It has also become known that the walker devoted all his leisure time to drawing comics at home.
The members of the Valencia Legislative Assembly now think about how to punish Mr. Recio's immediate chief, who could not help but “reactively” work in his workplace.
Judges propose protection from presidents
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and to introduce their election.
For the courts of appeal and appeal, the HRC wishes to introduce special districts that will not be linked to the administrative and territorial division of the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The HRC has finalized proposals that will enhance the independence of the Russian justice system.
The HRC carried out this work on behalf of Vladimir Putin, dated 3 January 2017, which the President gave after meeting with Council members.
At a meeting with Council members on 8 December 2016, some cases of judicial arbitrariness were discussed, as well as issues of public control in the detention facilities of citizens (see “Autu” of 9 December).
As a result of the work of the HRC, 25 proposals have been made on both the issues of the independence of the judiciary and the identification of judicial errors, as well as the financing of the courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to restrict the powers of the presidents of the courts in order to enhance the independence of the remaining judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge has successfully been successful and has received the support of the judicial community, the President of the Court, according to the HRC, should submit him for appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to allocate cases to the judges.
It can be done by experts, a specially written computer program.
In addition, the HRC considers that the President is not entitled “to determine the qualifications of the judge, initiate disciplinary proceedings and decide on additional material payments”.
The Presidential Council, however, considers it necessary to move “to elect the presidents of the courts themselves” and “to give them a relatively short time with mandatory rotation”.
All the presidents of the courts (from republican to district) are now appointed for a period of six years by the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRC proposes a new appeal and Cassation to the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now tied to the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
In the HRC, it is stated that “it is necessary to ensure that separate courts of appeal and Cassation are organized, not at the regional judicial level, in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts”.
Experts base the practice of arbitration courts.
They have “judicial districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but that guarantee greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty in using “telephone law”.
The justices of the peace of the HRC propose that the people's assessors should be strengthened to deal with certain “civil and administrative categories”.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of employment, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
“It's just our proposals”, explained HRC member, Constitutional Court judge Tamar Morszczczekov.
She also recalled that the President ' s task was not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (HU), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the military (among the co-defendants - the Office of the Attorney-General and the Human Rights Commissioner in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the Russian Federation, President Vyacheslav Lebedev must be in office until 1 September.
Living a high life: the semi-departure and subtle design techniques turned this little apartment into a simple apartment in Earls Cort
Joan Lee, a former banker involved in real estate repair, moved from a space house in Nightsbridge in 2014 to an apartment in Earls Cort.
The flat is on the first floor of a nice model house in Queen Anna's style, and in favor of a new design, Joan doesn't pick up her things or move back.
"I used to live with my ex in Nightsbridge on a much larger square," Joan says.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day."
Since the first view, a 1,000-square-foot apartment has been renovated.
Originally, it was an apartment with one complicated design bedroom – to get into the bedroom, it had to pass through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and semi-depotation to get the most out of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my demand," she said.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural design studio, "Duck & Save", to use a 12.5-foot ceiling and create a home that would not only be a successful project, but would be good for Joan to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate the two spaces above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-dwelling place where to stand fully.
Erfana had to think creatively to cope with the reef.
“Working with steel structures is very complicated,” he explains.
“We had to place the premises so that they were one above the other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was not just necessary to build a simple platform; it was necessary to bend the structure so that it would be at the right height and allow space to be used from the top and the bottom.”
That decision allowed Erfan to make two full - size rooms above each other in the space assigned – and there was still a lot of interest.
From the semi-circuit through the venting copper light window from the Retrouvius, the view of the beautiful living room below is visible.
The starry furniture with the gold compartment, the silver accentes, and the VIV lights from Serge Muy make out the design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding visibility, space and light.
The short corridor is lined with mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protection panel looks like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirror closets serve to store all Joan’s dishes.
To create a feeling of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room may block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new about the emerging kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a moving up door, like in a garage.
“The engineering art was involved here”, Erfan's story of an embroiled wood and fibre shield door.
"She's fitted with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily."
With the reasonable use of storage space and space, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“In the end, the sex area is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your real estate is estimated to be,” says Erfan.
“Supremely, the real estate agent will enter and make calculations based on the sex area.”
Here they were able to expand the sex area by using quality materials that give the space a luxuries of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help to create emotional relationships with the house,” says Erfan.
"No one falls in love with the wire in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't hurt the strings of our hearts."
It's an indication that, with good design and enhanced metro, the apartment can turn from something normal to something amazing.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a Commission on Cultural Policy
The Russian Government approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The relevant regulation is published on the Government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission would be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also draft cultural policy strategies, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
A Vice-Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation has been appointed Head of the Commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dimitri Medvedev, approved, in 2016, a plan to implement the State Cultural Policy Strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries and to preserve the same cultural space and cultural heritage and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
G20 inflation fell to the eight-year minimum
Consumer price increases in the G20 countries have fallen to the minimum in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that the inflation rate in June 2016 was 2 per cent - lower in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Rosstat had previously reported a decrease of 0.1 per cent in the consumer price index in Russia.
The agency thus recorded the first one-week deflation in 2017.
The rate of inflation in Russia is estimated at 4.1 per cent.
The Ministry, however, believes that the target has already been achieved - according to this agency ' s version - at 4 per cent.
Putin warned against illegal cutting of the Baikal Taiga
The Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal Territory, warned against illegal forest destruction.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donski, noted that a bill had previously been drafted.
It permits deforestation at the time the fires are eliminated, and the Government is planning to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be monitored so that “all things will not be cut out in a row” in the process of cutting.
Donski noted that the bill involved monitoring by MES and supervisory agencies.
Media: FAA troops secretly agree with the Donbasa militia from the command.
A regular telephone service was established on the line of armed confrontation in Donbasa.
Fighters from the warring parties regularly communicate with one another on mobile phones, which they do not know about at headquarters.
The FAU and the Donbasa militia have established cell phones in secret of their high command.
This is reported on 4 August by Strana.ua with reference to the military operations in Donbassa.
According to the publication, unit commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the other side of the front and communicate with them by telephone every day.
Communication is not domestic at all: commanders are trying to reach some sort of tactical agreement.
Part of the results of such discussions are a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists have learned of occasions when an officer received greetings on his birthday from his front line, from his formal enemy.
The FAR and the DDP and LDP militia have been sitting in trenches on the line of separation since the beginning of the fighting against Donbassa by Ukraine in the spring of 2014.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was instigated by the blocking of the statements by the United Nations Security Council concerning attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation.
In the Russian Foreign Political Agency, some Western diplomatic representatives were outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives, who blocked the statements made by the United Nations in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The agency was reminded that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus, on 2 August, was the third time a month subjected to mortar fire from the terrorist groups Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in the Russian Federation) and Fileak Al-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community has unanimously identified Nusra as a terrorist organization, and UNSS resolutions have been called upon to counter this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation has noted that “it seems clear that the Nusra attacks must face a general and unequivocal condemnation and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions”.
However, “the third time in a month, United States, British, French, Ukrainian and Ukrainian diplomatic representatives on the United Nations Security Council alternately, changing the tone of objections to the alleged lack of information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft Security Council statement to the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain in the conscience of those delegations.
“It is most disturbing that the Security Council's failure to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to new provocations and attacks, gives them a sense of impunity,” stated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, adding that “it is not desirable for these barbarians to have the conviction that someone on the Security Council is in union with them.”
Vladimir Putin was in favour of limiting the number of exceptional business inspections
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at an investment meeting in the Far East, stated that the number of exceptional business inspections should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number of planned ones, and that the time limit for inspections should be limited to 10 days.
“Extraordinary checks are usually carried out without appropriate consultation with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3 per cent are agreed with the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the rest goes on its own”, quotes the President of TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from removing servers and hard drives from businesses.
In addition, in the view of the President, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
“This, I hope, will have some effect on business-related cases or on the violation of the law in business”, said the Head of State.
Other types of business inspections are increasing as a result of a moratorium on scheduled inspections, as reported by the “Joseph” report.
In May, at the request of the business commander of the President of Russia, Boris Titova, conducted a survey that revealed that there had been an actual replacement of the scheduled checks by exceptionals (from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), by prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), by raids (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and by checks on citizens ' claims (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and by administrative investigations (1.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More details about the business checks in the little business paper came on the other side.
Brothers fighting for an empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers fight for one of the largest real estate empires in the state of Victoria, worth more than $500 million -- 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of the Carlton football club and builder Colin de Lunis lives in Turak Palace, three doors from his younger brother, Paul, who filed a claim against him with the Supreme Court for division of property and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still having a fierce dispute about the terms of divorce.
Along with their mother, Anna's brothers own 87 facilities worth more than half a billion dollars since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lunis family's property list today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, golden bank apartments and Mount Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late father of Colin, whom Paul describes as “the main driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lunis family, he owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's property is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful reconciliation attempts, the first hearings were held before the Supreme Court.
Now the brothers are arguing about who's going to control the existing business - from which Paul believes Colin has expelled him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but blames Paul for the incompetence of certain facilities.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he said he looked forward to a settlement of the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider seven the highest priority," he wrote.
Court expenses are rising as snowball: hundreds of pages of evidence, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Kramer are involved; both parties engaged the best-known lawyers, including the royal lawyer Allan Mayers, and the best-porting lawyers.
Mrs. De Luteuris and her late wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they have run milk bars and gastronoms and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
With financial guarantees, they bought a store in Colingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "the last grade of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Luis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Louigi often told me that she didn't want the brothers to be heard in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer a member of the De Lunis group; Colina says that Mark got 10 million when he got out of business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office".
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGir, the best friend of the television star.
Ferfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
He answered only Colin, a text message stating that, since the case had not yet been heard in court, “I have nothing to say. ”
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to stand up in court for the name of our family," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding that "still hopes for a solution to the conflict."
That hope must have been scattered on Friday.
"The decision in our case will be rendered soon by a court of law," wrote Colin.
The new head of Trump's apparatus plans to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others have tried to do so and have lost.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do that.
Then he'll be the first.
Polico reports that the new head of the White House's apparatus plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news from the media, in the hope of keeping the Chief in a calmer state.
That's what reporter Josh Doozy says.
"At a meeting that hosted the new head of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the management of the apparatus on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trumpe, which he hopes to solve: the bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through it - paper or briefings - because the President would be better able to make decisions if he was given the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is accurate, but others have failed by trying to calm Trump down, tracking information.
President Trump's relationship with television was a few decades ago -- and now, when he's in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair publicity given to the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received fair publicity in publications that could be persuaded,” said Sam Nanberg, former Electoral Staff Adviser, in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote to "Politico" that "in the words of the six former members of the electoral staff, to control Trump's practice of Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that the personal information received contained a constant flow of praises."
All right.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing on Twitter was ever "under control" was ridiculous.
Maybe these election staff members know something we don't know -- for example, that if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets Trump didn't publish.
If his staff had kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts had not been in vain.
But no one ever managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Trumpu with material - reliable or not - which confirms their views.
"Policy" - just to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to keep giving the President questionable information.
Here's an example described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Recent and former Trump officers say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds who was behind them.
That was the case at the end of February, when someone put a print on the President of an article from GotNews.com, the Web-provoking website of Charles C. Johnson, in which the deputy chief of apparatus, Cathy Wellsch, was accused of "standing behind a number of leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever overlooked on Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he didn't provide specific facts, or that in the past he started false accusations and then abandoned them.
Trump read the article and began to ask the staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that the then head of machine Rains Prybus and the secretary of Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage and document the stream of paper that Trump receives."
How did this work?
Three months later Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Prybus, but Trump still has a stimulant nature and his assistants continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The prison prosecutor's office is fighting a HIV dissident
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the order of the Kalininian Paradise of Tumeni, who dropped criminal proceedings against a local woman who had died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child was killed because the mother was an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court removed her responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished without setting a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tumeni was brought under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (cause of death due to negligence) in April, following the death of her three-year-old daughter from HIV infection.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
“The woman did not cure herself and refused treatment of her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection”, explained to the Office of the Prosecutor of the Tuman Region.
The criminal case was brought to the Kalininsky Paradise Tumeni, who decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The father of the deceased girl made the request, explaining that “I have forgiven my wife, I have no claim against her, I have forgiven her and I apologized”.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office disagreed with the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to terminate the case be set aside and that it be referred to a new hearing.
The girl is dead, and the harm caused by the crime cannot be repaired.
The HIV-positive mother, contrary to the recommendations of the doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat it with a dangerous infection”, reported to the press service of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In the opinion of the supervisory body, it should be punished, or it should be followed by other HIV dissidents.
According to the Tumen Center for AIDS, about 12 children living with HIV are currently not receiving medical care because of parental failure in the Tumen region.
“And this situation has already improved – in the year of the special group, half of parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV have changed their minds – allowed for diagnosis, took drugs,” said Helen Lorev, a spokesman for the AIDS Center.
She said that it was impossible to influence parents by law, and not all children living with HIV were found to be infected; mothers were not allowed to examine them, hide them, and run with children from hospitals.
HIV dissidents are at risk
At the end of last year, Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called movement of HIV dissidents.
HIV dissidents are described as people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Health professionals and AIDS service advocates call such views anti-medical, and they see their spread as a serious threat.
The terrible photo session, which ended in the tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Grechana railway station in Khmelnitzk.
A cheerful company of drunk young people was walking a bridge over the railways, where a freight train was standing.
One of the friends had the idea of making a powerful selves on the roof of the wagon, and told Fatam in the police communications sector in the Khmelnica region.
The boy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion, he got caught up in the power line and was hit instantly.
Fortunately, the station dispatcher became aware of this case and immediately called for an “incontinent”.
The victim ' s doctors were moved to a safe place before his arrival and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnica Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with torso burns of 1-2 degrees.
His condition is now valued as stable by doctors.
Law enforcement has reminded us that in recent times extreme selves on the roofs of multi-decks, bridges, and traffic have become increasingly popular.
The police called on people to be vigilant and to prevent such sessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the oceans of the ancient city of Venus to exist
There could be oceans on the ancient city of Venus.
French scientists made this suggestion.
Experts have developed a computer model that demonstrates the water creation process on the surface of the planets, writing Science News.
It turns out that at the beginning of its history, there were oceans that had 10% more water than there are now.
Previously, the Week's Arts said that scientists have suggested that the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign researchers in their studies concluded that the water facility was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured by fire in the San Francisco Park
In San Francisco, three people were injured as a result of the shooting and handed over an Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where a large number of visitors were present.
According to the witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them took a gun and started shooting at people.
Their appearance could not be considered, for they had everything but their eyes closed.
Another was provided with medical care, after which he was released.
The third victim is a minor and no details of his condition are available.
The Dolores Park hill is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured trying to leave the premises.
Louna rock band will present a new album in Barnaul
The Louna rock concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
Musicians will present their new album "The Great New World," which is one of the most expected releases of the year.
The team is preparing a concept show, which will become the most vivid in the band's concert history.
"The Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
His name is linked to the famous anti-anti-topia novel O. Hucksley, "Oh strange new world."
The new songs do not translate the book, but they tell of a society that lives under the law of anti-utopia, “blind faith in propaganda and imposed values”.
The group was helped to raise money to record the album: more than 1,200 people supported the project on Planet.ru.
Louna released her first album, "Make Gromche!", in 2010.
Two years later, musicians presented Time X, and in 2013, they recorded an album called "We Are Louna" (2013).
In the autumn of 2015, the Louna group performed a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the Peace Songs.
Among the Lusine Guevorkiang (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas Guitar), Ruben Kazarian (histar), Sergey Ponkratiev (histar), Leonid Kinsburski (barabane).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club of Faraon on 17 October at 7 p.m.
Ticket price: 1,200 to 2,600 roubles
Louna is one of the required groups on the Russian rock scene.
The team was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The group has won a number of hits on various hit-and-pharat designations of "The Church of Dugins."
The Gypsys overrun the moat and returned to the streets of the millionaires.
Some of the richest homeowners of West Midland are again competing with the determined gypsy who have overcome the trenches of the municipal authorities in order to reoccupy the fields near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich street of Solhall, which was called the “millionaire street”.
Bringing horses, babies and many wheelhouses with them, they returned after being expelled as early as May and were not hindered by the swarms dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed its vehicles through a section that was left unprotected to leave room for the tropics.
The angry residents attacked the municipality of Solikhallah, saying that it had proved “unable to solve this problem”.
An anonymous local woman reported: “They came here Monday evening after being driven from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.”
Municipality should be shamed and forced to act because it is completely impossible to solve the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were driven away, and they came back again.
Last night there were more gypsy, and today perhaps more.
“The Birmingham Municipality knows how to solve this problem; they receive long-term orders to protect their parks”, she added.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like the fact that I keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it.”
One local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leaving the previous time, and please, this attack continues."
This time they became more numerous, and we even saw a horse feeding on the meadow.”
A representative of the municipality of Solakhalla stated: “We know of an illegal camp on land near the Streetsbrook Road and we cooperate with the Solikhal police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible.”
To help us collect evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by telephone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that will be considered by the court when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares a champagne wine factory called the New World.
The HUP of the Republic of Crimea, the “New World Champagne Wine”, has decided to share in the conversion of the Champagne Wine Plant “New World”, as ordered by the Minister for Property and Land Relations of Krima Anna Anuhina.
100% of the shares of the enterprise will remain in the public domain of Crimea.
The capital stock of the equity society will be 595.5 million roubles and will consist of 5.955 million regular shares with a nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Crimea Ministry of Agriculture stated that if no funds were available to modernize the plant over the next three years, there would be a risk of stopping the plant.
The enterprise ' s core wear and tear is between 60 and 70 per cent.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion roubles, and due to the characteristics of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of its revenue to the budget.
What remains is not sufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"To get money from the owner is problematic, it's difficult to talk about borrowing from large credit organizations," said the subheadings of Crimea Sergei Petelin in April of this year.
The Crimea Parliament included the enterprise in the privatization plan for 2017.
It was suggested that it be shared and tendered.
The source of Interfax in Crimea authorities estimated the potential value of selling an enterprise of $40 million, and the investor's investment in upgrading it of $30 million.
The New World increased the production of needle wines by 2.8 per cent from 2015 to 1.52 million bottles in 2016.
In 2017, the New World intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The business was founded in 1878 by Prince Lvo Golitsin as the Igris wine plant in his acquired New World name.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Underurban third graders have destroyed more than 40 graves
The officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Suburban Region identified the citizens who had destroyed 46 graves in the cemetery of the city of Liskovo.
The perpetrators were third - class students.
The first claim that the graves were damaged by unknowns was made to the Russian MUPD in the Lyskov district on 27 June.
A total of 24 people have approached the police on this matter.
As a result, criminal proceedings were initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code, “Effect, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police had identified suspects, and they had two students aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing monuments fall, and that led them to hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone of NGOs saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs owned by rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new regulations governing their activities.
“If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities”, said the Minister of the Interior, Mario Miniti, in an interview with the Tunisian daily Stampa.
Minni's prevention was issued the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rett, suspected that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked for only one year, has refused to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartoio.
“For us the saving of human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot now continue our activities in the search and rescue zone,” states a statement by the organization in the social media.
"We will only be able to evaluate all the charges made now after we have collected all the information and been able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juvent vessel belonging to the Jugend Rett since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken on board entire lifeboats of migrants who were sent directly by traffickers to them and of allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is said to have been held only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as stated in the prosecution file, which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coast authorities, who control rescue operations in the zone, more for humanitarian reasons than for any other reason.
The code of conduct implies primarily that the Juventa-type vessels will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the Code of Save the Children, the Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa, with an extended embrace from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they did not involve any “significant change or interference” in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are the Nobel prize-winning Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minnit said that the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, the Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we do not want to associate with either side of the conflict.”
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently significantly increased their policy in the Libyan direction and, with visits to Moscow, the delegations of the opposing Libyan sides have been absent.
The head of the Russian Contact Group on the Internally Libyan Settlement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and of the State of Gosduma, the Assistant Head of the Republic of Chechnya, Lev Dygow, described the goals of Moscow in the region and who is betting on it.
The Contact Group on Libya that you lead is hardly known.
Let's say the contact group for Ukraine knows about it.
There's a secret.
What exactly are you doing? What are your goals?
The Contact Group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
It is administered by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Bogdanov, and Adam Delimhanov.
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan side by the Speaker of the Lord ' s Office, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The arrest in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 persons on board).
We've been thinking about how we can help the crew.
At the time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was established, and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
How do you know you're the one who led her?
As I have been working for Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the work of the team.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from Chebotariev Mechanic.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and Tripoli (the United Nations-based Government, headed by Faiz Saraj. - “Welcome”) - and Tobruk (the Parliament, which opposes the Government and supports the Marshalif Haftar, which controls eastern Libya. - “Welcome”).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (the Libyan Vice-Prime — October), we were able to agree quickly to release Russian sailors.
It was then agreed to establish a contact group to make more effective use of those contacts.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya, we do not want to associate with either side of the conflict; we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many are in the contact group and how many are permanently in Libya?
The contact group now has five members.
Among them are people with experience in the security structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to join the regional team of specialists from the Institute of the Middle East of the Ran.
There is no staff member in Libya at all times, and that is not necessary.
Whether there are Russian military advisers in Libya now, instructors.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group has military ex-combatants...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities closed to a certain point for us, such as Misurata (where militias are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi in 2011 and which were significantly intensified in subsequent years.
We arrived in Misurat in January this year.
We were scared, they said you'd all be united by Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what is behind the rumours, which is really the role of Islamists.
In Misurat, we met with all the members of the forces involved in the destruction of IH in Sirte (in December 2016, this Mediterranean town was taken off by the militants of Russia's banned “Islamic State” — October).
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to verify that they had played a crucial role in destroying IH in Libya, and not Khalifa Khaftar, who attributed it to himself.
And what is your conclusion?
Did not Haftar win the Islamic State of Libya?
It wasn't him.
The Haftar conducted operations on the other front, in Bengazi.
And IHs in Sirte were fought by structures that were subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited the people who had carried out this anti-terrorism operation to Russia.
And they arrived -- the visit was extended from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was admitted to the Council of the Federation, to Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Rosgvardy.
You, as we have seen, are in all Libyan regions and are likely to imagine the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections reached in Paris by Khalifa Khaftar and Faiz Saraj at the end of July?
Or again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, agreements will be broken, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
The fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting was a good signal for us, not too long ago.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
And with regard to Russia's position...
It is often written and reported that Moscow actively supports Haftar, and many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on board the Russian air carrier Admiral Kuznetsov that day.
It was a coincidence.
But they didn't believe in a coincidence in Misurat.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is to demonstrate that we do not support only Haftar; we are engaged in dialogue with all key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar talked.
Does understanding of Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he has studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian, if he knows, he's very relative.
But what we learned certainly facilitates our dialogue with him.
And by the way, he's not the only one.
When we associate with the military in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak great Russian.
And they're pulling towards Russia, and they're kind of nostalgic about it.
Do you consider it likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya will be lifted quickly?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
Interested, of course, but as I said earlier, we do not take sides in this conflict and we do not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to contribute to its lifting.
The process of drafting a constitution in Libya is under way.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve an internal consensus.
Then the elections are to be held, as was mentioned at Saraj and Haftar.
If elections are held and a legitimate authority is finally elected (and no party now has such status), the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the United Nations may be asked.
It would only lead to an escalation of the conflict to raise this issue in a meaningless and dangerous manner.
The media recently reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees from Libya, was feeling abandoned by all EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its relations with the Libyans?
For example, how realistic is the option that Haftar units will control the coast and put an end to the smuggling of immigrants into Europe?
A very timely question.
We're actively working on this.
Italians need support from Russia because Moscow is engaged in a dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj, and Misurata and the South.
Tribes in southern Libya play a major role in this regard, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it for the south to prevent the flows of migrants on far-reaching approaches?
I mean, conditionally, were the buses used to drive Nigerian migrants back?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope to help unite the south in the negotiations between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes of the south.
But to begin, we would like to see a consensus on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The Head of Government in Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered to be an Islamist, a supporter of Shariah norms.
How radical was his view?
Would this not be an obstacle to developing relations with Russia or the West?
I will express my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself is of the position that Libya must be a completely normal country - a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It's created by those countries that don't want Russia to communicate with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where the legislature, the executive and the judiciary are located.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government entities.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
And we mixed all the cards and started talking to Tripoli and Tobruck.
We are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosnepht has concluded a cooperation agreement with Libya ' s State oil company NOC.
The director of NO Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneffti Igor Sechin made a deal, himself from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first shipment of Rosneoft, Libyan oil.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'll resell it.
What are Russia's economic interests in Libya?
In plans to re-sign the contracts concluded at Muammar al-Qadhafi.
These include former transport arrangements (rail construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, like Iran, it's an oil-for-service scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be, but I don't deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy is not important for Russia in Libya.
We are, in fact, involved in peacekeeping.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya has ceased to be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, that is the main task of helping the Libyan people and of pushing terrorists out of it.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee who said that to date no Russian and other former USSR nationals are there.
He said that he had about 50,000 calls from Islamist and radical groups (in Libya) and that Russian speech did not sound there.
What kind of States are these militants from?
I don't want to go into these details.
Then the question will be formulated differently.
How many Islamic fighters in Libya are Libyans themselves?
Libyans are practically non-existent, not more than 5%.
The rest of them are stuck.
Could Moscow conduct intra-Lebanese negotiations along the lines of Paris?
There are plans for that.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have indicated their willingness to travel to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say.
Several visits should still take place, and I hope there will be clarity on the time and venue of the negotiations.
At the Czech Museum, charities raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Matzola, who has PCPs, brain hydrocephalia and complete blindness, will receive a special runway as a gift on 5 August.
A useful presentation is given by Sasha, the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region of Oksana Kosareva and the Director of the Museum of Constantine Bobkov.
The money for the trainer was collected during the charity marathon "Do not get tired of doing good" held in Melihov on July 15th, Chekhov Memorial Day.
The day before the marathon in the museum, I received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manuchino in Chekhovsky, saying, "I have no vision at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a gift of running the path so that my legs become strong, and I'd just learn to walk."
And Sashina's dream came true!
Following the presentation at the Museum Reserve Museum, there will be "Concert Postscriptum", a prominent pianist, well-deserved Russian artist Alexander Hindin will perform poplars from popular classical works.
During the philanthropist marathon in Melihov, there was a chorus of the Wozsen Davidna Desert, the bells of the Ilya Drosdikhin workshop, the students of the P.I. Tchaikovsky Conservatory and the Génezin Russian Academy, and the artists of the Melikhov Theatre of the Czech studio.
Public auctions were held, a book fair was organized and a charity sale of souvenirs with a marathon logo was organized.
The Melihovo Reserve Museum took the initiative to make Chehov Memorial Day on 15 July one day of charity in all the Podmoskovia Museum.
A 30-year-old resident of Olives Gitomir region near a local football stadium fired several shots at the young people who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angry with the noise, and was informed by Fatam at the Zhitomir Police Communications Division.
The man then entered a nearby cafe.
He had a conflict in the building, during which a man used a rubber firing device, wounding a visitor.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care and no threat to his life.
Police and medical ambulances arrived at the scene, but the shooter had already fled.
The law enforcement officials identified him and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man could not explain his actions.
He's got a rubber firing device that's sent to an examination.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code.
The detainee is liable to 3 to 7 years ' imprisonment.
We will recall that a shooting attack took place in Kiev on Lukiyangivka in the street of Tatar on the night of 28 July.
The sentence of Michelle Carter for reports that led to Conrad Roy's suicide
A citizen of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for having been motivated by text messages and telephone calls to commit suicide by her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michel Carter, now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family has been killed by grief.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until he appealed.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and cream blouse, listened to the sentence by standing, shaking his hands, and lowering his eyes.
"She killed Conrad Roy in her actions," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her life.
She didn't admit responsibility," she said.
"She showed no repentance."
But Carter's lawyer said it was “a tragic case she deeply regrets”.
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his view, her “age, maturity or even mental illness had not had a significant impact on her actions”.
The prosecutor read out a statement by Roy Lynn Roy's mother saying, "It's never been a day when I wouldn't mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I do - I try to support his sisters despite all the pain that will remain with us forever,” he says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was constantly thinking that she would never be able to attend his wedding or be the aunt of his children.
"To hurt a man who's always been with me since I was born is the pain that will remain with me for the rest of her life," she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, since Massachusetts does not have a law that provides for the purpose of advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case was brought to the attention of the entire country when it became clear that he had been driven to suicide by Carter’s message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before he died while he was resting with his family.
Just a few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you're gonna be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death, and he prohibited her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The legal professions have divided their views on this matter.
One of the few defenders of Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for killing his British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published her special opinion in the Los Angeles Times, which stated: “Michael Carter deserves sympathy and assistance, not prison”.
"I let Langford go like a high-fly bird."
One of the best basketball players of the WTB 33-year-old Keith Langford left Unix.
The departure of the U.S. defender Izvedov was commented on by Unixa's President, Eugenius.
Keith made this decision on family matters, told Eugenius Bog.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons at Unix, and at each match he showed a high level, by 100 per cent.
So I let it go like a high-flight bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and his career.
Keith Langford played at the Casan Club for three years, winning the silver of the Single League for 2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he was awarded a prize to the most effective player of the Euroliga season.
He averaged 21.75 points per match.
The result has been the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who won the 2014 award, was the second player in the history of the European Union to receive the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with China's Shenzhen, informing Eurooops.
The American is expected to enter into a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford is going to be the second-largest Euroliga star in July to be a Chinese championship.
Jannis Burusis had previously moved to China's CBA.
A sun-lit traveler from Podmoskovia was evacuated by helicopter in Adigea
Today, an Adige rescuer has evacuated from the mountain region of the Republic by helicopter an amphibious tourist who has received the greatest sunburn.
The man was resting at the Pisht, located at an altitude of 16,000 metres.
A 27-year-old tourist was subjected to increased pressure and difficult breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by the leader of the tour team, who told them that a man had been burned while on his way.
Audi will be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW announced that it would offer to upgrade software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The Chairman of BMW stated that the company believes that “there are more intelligent ways than restrictions on driving”, with reference to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – that have considered the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel cars.
Damler stated on Thursday that he was modifying three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their step a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But nitrogen oxides, which release diesel engines, are considered cancerous and can cause asthma.
The cost of auto-producer installation of diesel car exhaust neutrals is also rising, and maintaining competitive car prices is becoming difficult.
While German car manufacturers are under close scrutiny, the Chancellor ' s Government, Angela Merkel, was also accused of following powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs of problems.
Companies try not to repeat Volkswagen's error, which concealed the use of so-called “damage devices” which, during testing, were able to adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the regulations and, in normal driving conditions, were disabled.
In the United States, several leaders of Volkswagen were convicted and the others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in the Audi Engine Development Unit was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zakkeo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subjected to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to circumvent European emission regulations and expanded the investigation previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is the source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's income.
In Astrakani, a visitor to the cafe paid for the counterfeit money
The police received a report from a bank official regarding the detection of money received from a general unit, a suspicious bill of 5,000 roubles.
A study carried out at the Criminalist Centre revealed that it was false.
According to UMVD of Russia in the Astrakhan region, a visitor to a cafe who had bought a shaurum was paid by a bank note.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a currency authentication tool.
Police officers are currently identifying persons involved in the manufacture and marketing of a well-known falsified BF ticket.
Such offences are punishable by up to 8 years ' imprisonment with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on the residents of the Astrakhan region to pay attention to financial transactions; it is recommended that commercial workers establish instruments to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found an "Ada" planet on which even iron can swim
For the first time, after studying the properties of the giant exoplanet, WASP-121b, astrophysicists were surprised by its temperature, which is able to vaporize iron and other metals.
Experts have noted that water molecules are so heated by light that infrared radiation is emitted.
The Hubble telescope recorded the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes the water in the atmosphere of the planet to shine in an infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called hot eutheters - gas giants of size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system but situated dozens of times closer to the parent star.
As a result of this year, the exoplanet is only 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas covering is almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become the symbol of Provence and South France, but there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda grew worse because of the dry weather and insects that carry disease, causing constant headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Shes, an expert from the Agricultural Research Institute of CRIEPAM in Provence, says, "The Lavanda in Provence is under threat because in recent years this plant has been experiencing the effects of climate change: it's been much less raining in the spring and in particular in the fall.
It affects the life of the lavender.
And there are also small cicadas jumping through the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, they are becoming very numerous."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavenders are not only attracted to vacationers; lavender oil is very useful in perfumery and cosmetics.
Eric Shes says, "In place of very long colosses with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent.
That's why we have fewer parts containing air oil."
The decisions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing the rate of evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and removing varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador Winter University 2019 met with the red-headed schoolchildren
Two-time hockey world champion, Ambassador Winter University 2019 Alexander Semin met with start-up hockeyists the day before and distributed autographs to the fans.
The meeting took place in the Winter Universals tent, 2019, as part of the thematic week on the hockey with the shaba.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on horseback in an artificial ice field.
In addition, squads, Victorians and games were organized to play the gift products of the student games, a waste from the Aerobics Federation.
Fifty students attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much sports as possible and stressed that the most important part of the initial stage was hard work and a great desire to do hockey.
"It's great that Krasnoyarsk has an area like Winter Universals 2019 where start-up athletes can ask direct questions to team coaches," said the champion.
Let's note that the Ambassadors of the Winter University 2019 help promote student sports and healthy lifestyles among the red-heads.
The Universal Council will work throughout the summer until 25 September, reporting to the Press Service of the Winter University 2019.
The words of Medvedev were commented on in Gosdepe
In commenting on the briefing by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dimitri Medvedev, the U.S. State Department of Justice, Mr. Heather Nauert, stated that there was a need to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found “to improve bilateral interaction”.
The Syria Armistice Agreement was an example of such successful cooperation by Nauert.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people all over the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work together," said the diplomat.
However, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev's claim of a full trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, then of course it has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more on this subject," said the representative of the State Department.
Formerly, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, the head of the Government of the Russian Federation, the Medvedev, stated that Washington had declared Moscow a full commercial war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that US sanctions would be in force for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes that the American artifact “has lost” Trump.
The missing bodibilder in Podmoskov was found on a foreign record to be a lost memory
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov was missing on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very extreme circumstances: he left the car cabin to go to the bathroom.
For seven days it was sought unsuccessfully by familiar and local residents.
And Shemil was on a strange date in Ramensk.
He was found naked in his toilet.
The Dagestan athlete was unable to explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
The announcement of his missing identity helped to establish his identity.
The medical personnel who came after the call recorded a partial memory loss and brain and brain trauma in Hanmetov, reports the Mash photo.
Perhaps there are other surprises waiting for the athlete.
The perpetrators of Shemil’s abduction may have been in his apartment, the keys he was also stolen from.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues generated as a result of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, reports the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as the agency explains, was due mainly to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar per rouble compared to the average monthly value of June used for assessment, as well as to the excess of actual gas production and oil exports of projected levels.
“The rejection of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from a monthly estimate consistent with the Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected to be +40.2 billion roubles in August 2017,” says the Minfin communication.
Thus, total foreign exchange purchases on the domestic currency market from 7 August to 6 September 2017 amount to roubles 47.6 billion.
Accordingly, daily purchases of foreign currency would amount to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Each working day during this period the CB will enter into foreign exchange purchases in the organized tenders of the Moscow Exchange on an even basis during the trade day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The killing of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The weekly newspaper Riodosé usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss plans to highlight the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children to an office where a grenade had already been thrown in 2009 or leaving them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on a board in the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked journalists to name each column - evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal feelings will be sufficient.
They are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being held by the Government or cartels, and they are a whole list of bullies that make it dangerous to report on the chaos in Mexico.
Violence is no longer extenuating, and more and more journalists among the corpses in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 persons, after attacks and threats, are under federal protection; and this year, at least seven people have been killed in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspirer, the co-founder of Riodos, Javier Valdés Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdés in one of his numerous books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is everywhere - a large photograph of Valdés showing the middle finger, with the inscription “Justice” hanging on the front of the Riodosé building; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing his smile, face in glasses or his firm Panamanian.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their overall trauma, their nightmares, their sleeplessness, their paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of drug-trafficking and organized crime-related killings every year, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodos journalists insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, even though they are killed by grief, although they are more dangerous than ever.
Without information about the killers, without justice from the security talks at the meetings, there is little benefit, ” Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdés left the office of Riodose in the capital city of Couliacan.
He was able to travel only a few blocks before his red Toyota King was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twenteenth River".
The man who shot went out on his car and smashed her nearby.
Valdés was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two grown children.
Hearings usually vary rapidly.
But Valdés is virtually silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited in the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum.
Let's not talk about killing one or more people every day in the streets of Sinaloa or saying that the cemetery is filled with two-dwelled drug mausoleums, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that the state of calm is just when one of the cartels takes control of a maritime state with important ports and drug trafficking routes in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdés was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was crushed by guilt for failing to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damasso López, the leader of one of the rival Cartel factions who is fighting the sons of Guzman.
The publication could have made the sons angry; those allegedly members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second error was that he did not force Valdés to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper had been seized and wrote about the same story.
Valdés was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his murder was considered a regular milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He'd been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroest, and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded Riodos, sold his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without touching on the subject of drugs," said Bohorquez.
In time, the newspaper earned the reputation of being courageous and honest, selling and advertising.
The journalists liked that they were able to publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were drawn to reading about something that no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its foundation, Riodos received a prestigious prize for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdés won the International Press Freedom Prize for the courage to investigate the Mexican drug trade, wherever it might be.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ Award.
The drug trade in Sinaloa, “this is a way of life”, he said last October in an interview with Rompveento TV.
"You've got to accept the tasks that you've got to be a journalist -- either that way, or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around you... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodos' employees miss Valdez, a joke who scolded like a truck in a port, a friend who's generous in embrace and advice, a teacher who knew how to get on with the living.
They trusted in the order he had set.
He always had to wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they're asking him, has he lost his love for the one-time order?
His death caused them to question their calculations about how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like you in their wives, their kids, their legal business and underground drug airfields.
"These things were behind the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in better times, was a high level of self-censorship and self - preservation.
We have to trust our instincts.
Stay away from things that smell bad.
Problem, says the editor of Riodos, Andrés Villareal, is that "we can be deceived... and then what happens to Javier."
The old rules, he says, and others, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak State institutions and corrupt officials.
Landschaft is changing all the time.
In a room where Riodosé staff had gathered for security training, it had suddenly been forbidden to supply cell phones: a few days earlier, it had become known that spy programmes, which were being sold exclusively to Governments, were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
On the outside, two policemen hide in the shade of a 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the State Government to protect the Riodose office, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois district of Kuliacan.
Some journalists asked half-way whether the police officers were part of those 50 per cent of the ministers of order, of whom the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
In the next issue, Riodos relied on three main topics.
It's the murder in Sinaloa of a brother of a former champion on boxing Julio Cezar Chávez.
They also had government expenditures that were concentrated in the governor ' s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Kulyakana, a quarter from the DA's office.
It was not officially announced who had been kidnapped or how it had happened, so caution was needed when it came time to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant for drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for nearly the past century.
Recently, a number of PRI governors were accused of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in the restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Guzman escaped the military.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for a column of Valdés with the most reliable information on the abduction.
"We'd sooner know what happened," says 46-year-old Villaral, for her thin body called "El Flacco."
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdés Cabinet is now being used as a billboard and counter-survey warehouse against the killing of journalists, because staff members have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramírez took several posters and went to a demonstration by the local prosecutor's office on another journalist the following morning.
El Salvador Adama disappeared in Michoacán State in the west of the country three days after Valdés was killed.
Found a burned body and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists have spoken louder, organized protests and wrote "SOS Press" on sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorquez was in Washington, D.C., trying to obtain international support for the demands of justice in the Valdés case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez Ramírez, the authorities accused the authorities of spying for journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then asked for no more tasks to cover the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdés has said on many occasions that journalists in Mexico are “enclosed” by organized crime, their accomplices in the Government and a careless society.
In his last book, "Drug Journalist", he wrote that reporters are killing more than gangs of drug traffickers; they do so on orders from politicians and security forces in association with organized crime.
The Arctic 19 Press Protection Committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on the orders of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you down," says Ramirez.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
There was a note on her body that was supposed to be written in the face of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and earphones were next to her cut head.
Some publications preferred to close up like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent, Miroslav Brich, was killed in March.
Others continue to stand as El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo following the assassination of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels through a first-page editorial entitled "What do you want us to do?"
Some journalists have left their native states or even their country.
That's a painful solution.
It was difficult to find work in exile, and they continued to identify the dangers in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as was evidently the case with photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance risk solutions daily.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he's scared of writing about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for press, the publishers of Riodos were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when their phones rang simultaneously.
A series of gunfires between fighting gangs and security forces near the resort city of Masaatlan left 19 bodies behind, according to confirmed evidence.
The war continued, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
On the sidewalk, they posted news via their mobile phone on the Riodos website.
The next day, I had to re-read the first page.
Sirens were fired nearby, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes saw if the guards were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they never showed it.
While sitting under a huge portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was displayed for the entire Sinaloa survey, the Riodosé officers continued his case.
'How can you think of closing up,' said Bohorquez, 'if the very day Javier was killed, the practicing officer asked me to send her outside to report?'
Dinosaur used a compass to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, albeit a frightening one.
The researchers reported that the first finds of an incredible creature the size of rhino found by a Canadian miner remained so well that experts called it “Mona Lisa among dinosaurs”.
It has been so well preserved that they have even been able to determine that the colour of his groovy skin was red and brown – and to say that he had, in some way, “dark past”.
In a report published in Modern Biology, it was described as “the best preserved from Tireophorus in history and one of the best copies of the dinosaur in the world”.
It is a fossil — a recently discovered copy of a nodozavra, which lived in the middle of a melodious period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His amazingly good condition has been overwhelmed by researchers who call him “really remarkable”.
This herbivore is the most well-reserved fossil of this species in history, according to the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Funk when he was working in the Millenium Mine of Sankor near Fort McMurrey in North Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He came across something that seemed different from nature and decided to look more carefully.
The fossil record he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrellian Palmeontology Museum.
The next six years, work was done to detect an animal inside the earth’s depth with a mass of 2,500 feet (100 kg).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the end result can be demonstrated.
“It's only worth a little while, and you can almost believe he's sleeping,” said the lead author, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrells Palmeontology Museum, where creation is demonstrated.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well preserved copies of the dinosaurs: Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs."
As researchers studied his skin, they discovered that it was herbivore, even though it was covered with a shell and resembled a tank that was walking, apparently exposed to considerable danger from the fleshy dinosaurs.
This powerfully-covered dinosaur used red and white rubber to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow him to blend faster and avoid encountering enemies, say the experts, assuming that larger dinosaurs were hunting him.
This creature of 110 million years of age, belonging to the Nodosur family, was widely publicized in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrell Palmeontology Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitechelli in honor of museum labator Mark Mitchell, a member of a group who spent more than 7,000 hours digging for it.
The remarkable preservation of a copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scholars to document the drawing and shape of the chicec and the puny plates on his body.
They found a protective color, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although protective coloring is common, discovery has become a surprise because Borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than the animals currently living with protective paint.
It may be assumed that the dinosaur was so actively preyed on by the fleshy dinosaurs that evolution chose to mask confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern - day animals with protective colors — such as deer, zebras, or armouredians — are much smaller and are more accessible, indicating that nodosaura has had to struggle hard to survive.
“The serious threat posed by predators for a massive, massive dinosaur’s shell shows how dangerous the melodies were,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the dinosaur ' s cherries also indicated that its skin was to be red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the remaining contents of its digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into a river and was taken to the sea, where he drowned and with his back his lungs on the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Albert was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans are likely to have spread far inland than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is indeed remarkable in that it covers the skin of the remaining grotesque and at the same time remains completely in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal,” said Brown.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked back in the early morning period.
You don't really have to use imagination to re-establish it, you just have to have a little bit of a skin, and you can almost believe he's sleeping."
The iron period is an era when giant terrors, carnivorous dinosaurs, on two legs, wandered around the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the Tyrannosaurus river, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, it was possible to hunt a man from his formidable ancestors.
These include an acrocantosaurus, a monster 38 feet [11.5 m] long, weighing six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in the magazine Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to the sea after his death and mummified.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he was working in the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurrey in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to museum staff, it is the world ' s best preserved titrophorus, along with skin and shell, and it is whole, from the face to the femur.
On average, these creatures were up to 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Their characteristic feature was two 20-inch spikes from the shoulder.
The researchers believe that this herbivorous tyreophorus was hard on what is now Canada until the spilling river carried it to the high seas.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his shell with accuracy to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular copy have been so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the burgeoning plates along the dinosaur ' s skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of security is “almost like winning a lottery”.
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossil remains of the skin still cover burgery plates that fill the animal’s skull.
His right foreleg is stretched along the side, his five fingers are turned up.
I can count on his soles."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to reach Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously led Georgia and then the Odessa region of Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted a video on its YouTube channel with its presentation.
Saakashvili addressed the commemoration of the Warsaw Rebellion against Hitler's forces in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to begin speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician addressed the topic of Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland and also spoke of Ukraine.
The fact that the Ukrainian migration service had deprived him of his citizenship had been learned by an optical politician while in the United States.
It is not yet known how he has made the transatlantic flight without documents.
Previously, Mikhail Saakashvili, the former governor of Odessa province, stated that his signature on the questionnaire for the acquisition of Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not filled out any questionnaires.
The case of Weinziher and Olhovik was extended until January
The preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Renov group of companies Evgeny Olhowick and the head of the energy-cooling company, T Plus, Boris Weinzicher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Bassman Court is considering the extension of the accused's house arrest.
The representative of the UK at the meeting reported on the most recent decision to extend the period of preliminary investigation.
“The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and assess a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations in the territory of several constituents of the Russian Federation,” said the investigator.
He added that suspects regularly bribed the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Mihail Slobdin, who was the head of Wimpelka, Olhojik and the former head of WAO, provided bribes to the highest officials of the Republic of Komí for setting the most favourable heat and electricity tariffs, and for creating an enabling business environment, until 5 September.
Weinzicher and Olhovik were arrested, staged in Sistivkar and arrested for two months, Slobdin fled the investigation and was declared a federal wanted person.
How did one activist get the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shaken to the depths of his heart.
Only a day after arriving in New York, as part of her tourist tour, the mother-in-law of St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented via Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on the phone.
She came across someone from high school.
It said: "The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and he is still in the middle of the street."
Noting that none of her tapes had posted this information, confused, she closed her Facebook and opened her Twitter.
Her tape had a lot of user posts with @ThePharoah.
Reper, from the Big St. Louis, was real-time Twittering the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black boy 18 years old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown’s lifeless body, spread out in the street, where it would last four hours.
'It's wild,' thought Ferrel.
But death was not something new to her and her circle.
She put the phone down, and later in the evening, she went back to tweets about people going to Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of a warning tape and shouting people and a man who claimed that he was Brown's father, who made a poster saying, "Ferguson's policeman has just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protestors with a barking dog.
On another video another policeman, she told me, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals!"
"This is an unusual situation," by her own memory, then said Ferrel.
“It's not like the murder we're used to and we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt faint.
I'm angry and I'm crying."
She took a ticket back and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11: 00 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided they'd both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson over the next nearly three years was the subject of a new documentary entitled "Whose Streets? " , which will appear on the screen on August 11.
It's about survival and protest, about love and loss, about strength and resilience in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets, asking for answers.
While Ferrel was driving to Ferguson with a daughter dressed in a flower dress and a veneer of color, they remembered the conversation that had been held until that morning countless times, “the experience of the blacks and their situation”.
She recalls saying, "Do you remember when I told you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're on our way to Ferguson right now, because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't help but take it," said Ferrel later.
“What's happening today is the culmination of what's happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be educated about it.
It must not only understand activism and organization well, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their status and what we must do to be free to free ourselves.
Even if I could provide her with an environment in which she would not personally face obvious racism, she was no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do her a bad favor if she got her out of it."
When they arrived at Ferguson, the first stop was at the South Florissant Road, a square across the road from a police station that became something like a tent camp while activists waited for reports of the final indictment of Officer Darren Wilson
There Ferrel and his daughter joined a local businessman who was making lunch packs.
They collected packages and helped deliver them to the protestors.
Little by little Ferrel's consciousness has given shape to a new type of activism.
“My activism changed completely after 9 August”, she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis, she had been president of the Association of Sanitarian Students, National Minorities, and had been engaged in food justice and health inequality among the black communities.
“I had no experience as a organizer.
It came by itself.”
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her colleagues.
Folayan said that she and her main operator, Lucas Alvarado Ferrer, “just wanted to document” the events.
Ferrel came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story you can play?"
This skepticism was inflicted by many people, often whites, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and endurance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson did not come to the centre of attention, and we wanted to do so differently.”
By that time, Folayan had already come into contact with his fellow Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His participation was a source of sympathy for the Ferrel project and for six other local residents with whom the project team Whose Streets? had been in contact during the years following Brown's murder.
"It's not someone in this documentary who speaks for us or for us, we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
“It was the most important thing for me, as these people will be represented, because it is the way I will be represented.”
Although the aim of the project was not to focus on Ferrel's experience – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the rescue leader, but about how the community unites,” as Folayan said, it was the most open of the movie participants.
As a result, the “Whose Streets?” showed unexpected personal aspects of Ferrel’s life, for example, how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, laughing at the first time I saw the finished product.
“But I knew that when you do this work and you treat black people like that, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrel's history again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Life Movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - the ones who created the tag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the murder of Trevon Martin's black teenager in 2012 - claim to be gay.
“Black homosexual women in leadership support this whole movement,” says Ferrel.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan accepted this claim, noting that “the movement is, in fact, supported by black women and numerous homosexual black women”.
Nevertheless, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination”, and that Ferrel was not elected as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the man who provoked this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she's in first place because when"
You can feel its energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long had no camera cameras, but complex racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrel will be on probation for closing the highway for two and a half years during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called a home, simply "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she went out on Ferguson's streets full three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
Two Salvadorian football players were disqualified for U.S. players ’ bite
The football players in El Salvador, Henry Romero and Darwin Seren, received long-term disqualifications for their incomparable behaviour.
During the fourth final game of the Golden Cup of the North and Central American Cup and the Caribbean (CONCAAF), the Salvadorians bit United States players.
Henry Romero's attorney was the first to be distinguished.
The El Salvadorian bit the attacker, Josie Altidore, and then pinched him by the chest.
Then Seren, a paramilitarist, bit U.S. defense lawyer Omar González in his fine square.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches, and Seren was disqualified for six.

In the middle of the hall at Freedman Gallery in New York, people's faces are hanging from the ceiling on the wire -- white, black and brown, all of which are incomprehensiblely similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were painted by the artist Heather Dewey-Harborg with brush strokes and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Levenworth Prison where a former intelligence analyst serves a 35-year term for the famous transmission of sensitive diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called "The Origin of Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, information technology and art, and Manning, a female transsexual and famous dissident, whom Barack Obama reduced his sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
After reviewing and using a computer program from Manning to create three-dimensional portraits of individuals who might have had such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a profound, albeit difficult, manifesto on not only the plasticity of the DNA data, the different interpretations and the infectious determinism of those interpretations, but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but who had openly stated since his youth that he was a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Law on spying, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs in prison were not available, so only one of her photographs was known: the grainy black and white selves, where Manning in the platinum shade of the steam is obviously uncomfortable, driving a car; she is associated with this photograph.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed its 2012 project “The Visions of Strangers”.
In it, the artist produced portraits of unknown people by means of forensic evidence of the type of smoking and chewing cuts, by removing DNA from this garbage and by creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey-Hagborg on a preliminary display of a new press exhibit.
At that time Chelsea was not allowed to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison - sitting muse became friends in correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book on the comics "Stamped Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who showed how in the future the president would mitigate Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama really decided to release Manning only a few days after the book was released proved to be a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in the military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and powerful, and it's opening up right now that Donald Trump has declared war on the people who reveal secret information to the government and he's inventing new ways to inflame the hostility that he's trying to soften on Twitter.
When Dewey Harborg was asked to match it all over time, she said, "There's no chance there's nothing."
In an artist's statement on the gallery wall, the enormous signature of Manning below (with a heart in place of a point above "i" in her name) calls for an end to “automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the other side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar made of pencils C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as an artist's scientific expression), Dewey Harborg was hoping to show how we all look amazingly similar, in any case, in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data is to be interpreted and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Harborg; its 2007 video "False Memories" is also displayed here.
"The DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the above-mentioned novel in comic books.
On it, the King-Cong Manning appears above the U.S. Correctional Chamber with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it says.
"Then never shut up."
"It's a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me," says an artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I still have skin ants when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen an exhibition in person yet -- as was seen in comic books -- but when she comes, she'll be greeted by masks in the middle of the room, her own genome symphony, gathered together like a crowd of protestors.
It's also done intentionally, like everyone in the exhibition up to the height (5'2, Manning's growth), where the pencils were painted with genetic haglogroups.
"I'd sooner put them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," Dewey Harborg says about the portraits.
"I wanted them to look like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea as a movement that stood behind her release."
Professor of North-West University and a staff member at Oxford University are looking for a police officer accused of murder
The police report that there is a nationwide raid on Professor North-West University and a member of the University of Oxford who is wanted as suspects because of the death toll found in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the records of the Cook County Court, warrants were issued on Monday for pre-trial murder, without the right to be released on bail for 40-year-olds, Windham Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, 20-year-old Cornell Duranlo died after he was subjected to multiple stabbing injuries.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Office states that the body was found on 27 July.
The police called, they came to the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell Duranlo was declared dead at the crime scene, and now detectives are investigating the death of knife wounds, considering her to be a murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwest since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, Vice-President of the University of Communications, stated in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was prohibited from entering the campuses of the North-West University.
“It is now a criminal matter which is being investigated by authorized persons, and the University of Northwest cooperates with the investigation,” said Kabbah.
Warren is a senior finance officer at the University of Oxford.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail address: “We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigation authorities”.
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to give up.
The police liaison chief of Chicago Anthony Goulmie said he strongly advised suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“Police have any idea of their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are increasing,” Güllmi said.
According to Goulmie, local, regional and federal authorities assist in the search for suspects.
According to Goulmie, the police officer called the Grand Plaza building administrator, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene a terrible one.
Goulmie reported that it was not clear whether the incident itself occurred on 27 July.
According to him, the camera records confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were connected,” Gulelmi said.
The Grand Plaza published a message to the residents saying: “The police are currently working on the timeline of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of reasons, including a possible domestic accident”.
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko: “We will meet the requirements of the VADA road map in the near future.”
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the terms of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented shortly.
“Some stage of compliance has been completed, RUSAD has been given the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Trafficking Agency).
The VADA road map was updated accordingly," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the VADA road map for the restoration of conformity with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSAD and has recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could represent a problem for Russia.
"It has been announced, it will be fulfilled.
The results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly,” he added.
However, one of the requirements on the list implies that Russian Andidoping structures must publicly accept the results of an investigation commissioned by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who claimed that doping in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
On this issue, Mutko said, "We're investigating, because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there was no government programme, and we won't recognize what wasn't.
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
On the morning of the same day, Smirnov, in an interview with the Russian publication Rport, acknowledged previous problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report without reservation," Smirnov added.
WADA prevented RUSAD from carrying out Doping control in November 2015 after the Doping scandal.
However, in June this year it was allowed to plan and coordinate the testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit by the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivier Niggly, stated that RUSADA was “in the right direction” towards the restoration of its work.
Fire extinguished in the 79-story tower in Dubai
The big fire that took place in one of the world's highest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, is out of the way, handing over Reuters.
It is noted that the fireman managed all hot spots by 4:00 local time (300 msk).
The local authorities reported that no one was injured as a result of the incident.
When the fire was extinguished, the streets adjacent to the sky were closed.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
The Torch, one of the highest buildings in the world, was previously reported to have been on fire in Dubai.
All tenants were evacuated in time.
Buzov's improbable dress is a fan's shock: panties that don't cover their pants.
Olga Buzová, the scandalal leading reality show, was impressed by the Europa Plus Live festival in her pants.
In front of thousands of worshipers, a newly declared singer with Nasty Kudri performed a song called "We Will Be Warm."
The two girls came on stage with provocative "brokes" sewn together in such a way that they saw a singer's underwear.
The trousers were labeled Buzowa and Kudry.
In the past, it has been reported that a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic commented on changes in the appearance of Buzova.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported by Radio 4 on Friday, 4 August, with reference to foreign media.
He said that it was the Russian authorities who were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO Gensel also criticized Russia for the Crimea situation and for “destitution in eastern Ukraine”.
Stoltenberg assured, however, that dialogue with Russia was possible, and that further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that US-Russian relations were dangerously low and accused the U.S. Congress of doing so.
Ekaterinburg Metro is developing a new way of paying
In October, travel in the Ekaterinburg Metropolitan will be possible to pay a bank card, said by Paul Vedernikov, CEO of OAO "I-Net" in an interview with the Regional Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce into the 2018 World Cup the same system as other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the uniform, to take advantage of the subway by means of their bank cards, not buying badges or standing in line," he said.
The startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Herrett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among his startup in the area of e-commerce, but the surveys were not working.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse than that.
And even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He was never consistent and objective”, told Herrett, manager of a 75-person company called Madison Red, which deals with e-commerce in hair care, located in San Francisco.
She therefore asked for assistance from others.
A new type of start-up is now emerging in the area of staff management, which helps companies to see how their staff feel.
By developing and licensing software, the purpose of which is to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to perform express surveys, to contact certain teams and population groups, to offer staff anonymity and hotlines for complaints and, in some cases, to allow informationators to pass top management and direct management.
“Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Redwood City startup, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
Herrett told me that she had reached a better understanding of what her staff thought and felt in the three years she had used Glint.
In addition to the rapid surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a warm card to the company and shows in visual form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low validation rating that allows them to understand why.
Companies realize little that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they will become another Uber, who was involved in a scandal when a former staff member published a post on a blog describing an aggressive environment in which those who complained were punished.
For startups like "Glint", it's a desire to control the situation - the opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the Internet portal “Let's talk about payments” devoted to financial technology, the global governance, regulation and conformity industry may cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent startup from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect misconduct, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the face of a fall in Hubert's reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tella.
The Uber has recently appeared among clients.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send individual-ordered staff surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and monitor thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the head office.
“The court of public opinion has seized the authority of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinn, founder and president of Convercent.
If it is found that the company has been mistreated or has acted immorally, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may have costly consequences in the form of boycotts on the part of clients, staff outflows and lawsuits, Quinn reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 facilities, has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that staff are aware of the rules and procedures and to offer an easy way to approach the company's head office.
In the past, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for the phone number or Mail of the head office, file an official complaint and hope that she or she would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, director of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, that there was no normal way to monitor staff complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states — such as discrimination, harassation and unfair pay — can be discovered and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff members,” said Vitrano, who leads a risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
“And we protect our shareholders from judicial proceedings with staff.”
According to Queensland, companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values and involvement of staff members in 2002, after Arthur Andersen failed due to ethical irregularities resulting from Dela Enron.
But it was only when social networks were spread that companies realized they couldn't keep their dirty laundry from spreading virus on the network.
“Before we start using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both the “Glint” and the “Convercent” offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that was approved by venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interrelated nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
A growing number of studies show that today's staff expect more from their jobs than was previously the case.
In markets with fierce competition, such as the Silicone Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just the minimum necessary.
Staff members want to feel accepted and appreciated, and they devote their time to a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, they feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do brings results, they are more likely to make such a company a success,” says Nina McCuin, Vice-President for Global Benefits and Satisfaction in LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors get income when business from their portfolio goes well; business goes well when employees are loyal and engaged.
If third-party analysis promises to increase staff loyalty and engagement, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to cultural professionals in the workplace, it is important to have data on staff involvement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if the company asks staff for feedback, it may give the impression that changes are coming.
If change does not take place fast enough, or at all, frustration may develop and staff will lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you should be ready to hold 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rat, president of the management consulting firm Kotter International, who had to see companies make a mistake, relying too much on data collection.
'Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will say, 'Did you really hear me?
Don't you care?
And if you don't care, why don't I care?"
According to Herrett, Madison Red, which now conducts monthly staff surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after gathering feedback from staff who were not satisfied with decision-making speed and the quality of communication, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its staff and hopes that in the long term, it will be better able to retain staff in an industry known for its high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
A new asphalt is discovered in Barnaul on the Krasnoarmaya Avenue.
At Barnaul, decisive measures were taken to address the cause of the asphalt collapse in the Krasnoarmaya Avenue.
The place where the holes appeared twice on the newly falsified carriageway (scrambling with the Youth Street) is decided to “open”.
We will recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram roads was due to the land being settled in an area of an unexploited unexploited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Vice-Chairman of the City Committee on Road Affairs, Modernization, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for detailed survey and elimination of the conditions for collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the re-establishment and concreteization of the depths of non-expendable communications will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the capital city.
The Bruins team has to do longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled the training twice a day.
Time is approaching 11:00 p.m.; a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles is being delayed to talk on one side of the new training fields of the campus team.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts, exposed their backs that glistened with sweat after the busy first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these moments of idleness take a break in the middle of the day.
The players on the summers, after three hours of training, will go back to the dormitories to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning, they will return to Vasserman's football center for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, the coach of Bruins Jim More said, "The next three days these guys are waiting for a meat cut."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled the training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on the players, actually extended their work day - at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
So the start of the first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to be placed on an already dense schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two trainings a day has become more days with one training, and Bruins is moving towards the camp for almost a week than last year, and exercises during summer school for the first time in the six seasons of the Sea in Vestwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 training sessions by 20 August, inclusive, before starting formal preparations for the first game in the season against a team of the University of Texas, A&M in September.
Mora said that he supported a change of rules on the part of the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that he had created another point in the tight schedule of players.
“In the course of three or four days, we give them this enormous burden, this is a serious trial,” Maura said.
"And they've just overcome it, they work, they're great guys.
I think that when we get to the Saturday and have more time, it's really going to be great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will close the training; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombed with football balls over the safety net behind the gates.
The Bruins players have to occupy the hotel since this weekend, but Maura admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” Maura said.
"This is a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming someone can take a room, sit there and record the training on video.
If you have video recording of practice, it's very serious.
But we're gonna have security there and we're gonna have parking security number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in Petersburg are released from hospitals
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg's subway in April were released from hospitals.
This was reported in the press office by Vice Governor Anna Mitianina.
According to data at the end of July, there were three people left in the hospital, transmitting the TV Center.
Remember, the explosion in St. Petersburg's subway struck on April 3rd, this year.
The bomb blew up the suicide bomb Acbarjon Jalilov.
Fifteen people and the perpetrator were killed as a result of the attack.
In criminal cases, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
It will be recalled that, the previous day, Rosremnadzor recommended that the Metropolitan Peterburg revise the transport safety plan by, inter alia, increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook is increasing fact-finding against fair news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of myths to independent experts and show their conclusions under their original posts, and on Thursday the largest social network of the world is trying to combat so-called fair news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize potential myths, to send them for verification and, possibly, to show the results of a fact-finding post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways in which so-called fair news has been disseminated, which many believe has influenced the presidential elections in 2016 in the United States.
The issue is also under active debate in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the September elections, they expressed support for the plan to fine social networks if they did not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate German statement, Facebook reported testing a new fact-of-chiking algorithm that had been launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what reports are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments on what they read and share," wrote Sara Sue, Facebook News Manager in her block.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the “bound articles” function and work on other changes in the news feed to address the problem of fair news.
Create a novel comic book: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a haven for Margaret Tatcher.
But for 700 years from his comfortable place in the Byul Valley in Kent County, he was watching a ferocious story around him, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire, with a rough hair and history, on a comic book.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he said with encouragement.
"You feel that way when you hold this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian Era and tells of families who lived in Scotty; each story is illustrated by one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "The Dyings of the Dead and Other History" -- a collection of British Library records; this project suddenly touched him to the depths of his soul.
"I could have been touched by just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the cocoa," he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And letters always smell smoke, because in those days fire was lit.
And 300 years later, in the future, you feel like you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a person who is so passionate about old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and living in the castle for four months (the truth is, I've gone a little bit too far) seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the Victorian Castle for days, walked through the archives and considered many treasures of name and old things - for example, the hyenas' heads on the walls or bottles that had been in the ditch for centuries.
He went through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talked to the forestmen, gardeners, and sometimes to the artists who worked on illustrations of his book.
Then at night, he was "drinking whiskey and sitting down to write."
The history of Scotty's castle was not well understood, because the National Foundation had full access to it only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassy, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff were just starting to deal with an archive that he described as "that aristocrats have been dropping on the attic for centuries."
The days, the letters of the British Empire, the maps showing who owned what they were saying, "You think land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but that's what two families were fighting for.
That's the way it is, guys!"
In some stories, the castle is becoming the starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in "Worker's", the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Cristian Revolution.
“There is evidence of the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380 in a book called “Kenta and Sassex families of Russia”, says Rhodes.
"The peasant rebellion started in these places, and I thought that rebellion was the right beginning.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle, such as "The Priest", which tells of a Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family had hidden in their home for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Smuggler," about the 18th-century smugglers Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stoning the tomb (which was discovered a few years later when the tomb was dug).
The Darrells are Rods' beloved family of all those who lived in Scotty, "The gentlemen seemed to be perfect, they were always in debt, and they spent money on things they couldn't afford.
The Darrell men have dealt with their debt problems by marrying rich older women, and I think of them as a company of pretty guys who can look after the great estates."
After the end of work, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in a Finnish silence where he wrote a graphic novel about Eliamyak, a place where there was a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century and then it grew again with a forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"I felt like this: God damn it, I have to go back into real life."
Fifteen of the largest banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alphabank, Gazprombank, Rosselhosbank, Bin Bank and FK Open, seven other credit organizations are about to leave the public organization.
Thus, organizations that have withdrawn from the ARB will account for at least 80 per cent of the market.
But this is not just a solution - all banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization bringing together credit institutions - the Russia Regional Bank Association, led by the prominent politician Anatoly Aksakow, the Chairman of the Financial Market Committee, recognized as the last session and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and deputy in the number of bills drafted.
The outbreak of conflict within the ARB was the result of a discussion in the Council of the Federation, when new bills, such as new classification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital, were considered by the Interregional Banking Council.
Garegín Tosunyan, President of the ARB, then stated that, according to the Association, this bill was passed for the benefit of the largest banks, which thus sought to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which Tosunyan believed was not always justified in withdrawing licences from some banks, which was, indeed, the result of an objection by the representative of the CB: many bank leaders, such as Exprombank, were members of the ARB governing bodies.
This exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment is likely to be a visible occasion for the 15 largest banks to disagree with the ARB policy to begin preparing to join the Russia Association, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB is low and constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually taking place”.
It'll be better for the contributors.
What's going to happen?
To answer immediately the main question that arises in or near a bank failure or conflict: investors are not at risk, but rather the credibility of the banking system will be enhanced.
The Russian Federation is headed by Anatoly Aksakow, a high-level specialist known for his carelessness in the interests of banks and their clients, highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the CB is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert assessments of the “regionals”.
In terms of human resources and organization, there is no clear expectation of any particular shock.
There is no doubt that ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation when such powerful and influential participants, with their contributions and lobbying capabilities, are deprived.
However, there is considerable potential in this oldest organization, established in 1991 to promote the interests of the banking community, in order to continue to improve banking legislation and general monetary treatment.
It is not possible to say that Russia's open arms association is ready to accept new members on all terms, according to its leader's reaction, Anatolia Aksakova (“may be too much to want”), who, on 21 July, at a briefing in the press centre of the Parliamentary newspaper, stated that “just the next day, the representatives of the banks leaving the ARB asked me to consider developing the potential of our Russia Association”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Council of Association and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process is under way, the proposals of both parties are being examined, and the agenda for the extraordinary Congress of the Association is being prepared to be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum.
We'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakow, after stressing that “the chair does not hold onto”, described George Luntowski as the possible new head of the updated Russia Association, who leaves the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, giving him a high profile of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoli Aksakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to suspend leave for one day and to arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Russia Association Council, which is scheduled to consider the agenda for the extraordinary Russian Congress.
The entry of petrol-fuelled vehicles into the major Russian cities will not be restricted
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nicholas Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-fuelled vehicles into Russia ' s major cities would not yet be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to progressively improve the environmental class.
And there's a concept of zero emissions right away.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, since what year?
It's like this at the slogan level - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Shall we close the whole city?
"In 20 years -- I don't know, maybe that's what's going to happen," says the Minister's Prime.
Previously, the newspaper Izvedia reported that, by 17 August, the Vice-Prime Minister, Arcadiu Borković, had been asked to examine the proposals for possible options for power-driven transport submitted to the Government by the Director of PAO Kamaz Sergey Kogogin.
Among the suggestions, according to the newspaper, is the use of vehicles with ABCs in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a Green Card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the rules for obtaining a Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on the granting of family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two Houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so in the light of the change in the way in which the U.S. gives the credit cards to foreign citizens.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide an advantage to English-speaking candidates who have money to support them and skills to benefit our economies,” said Trump, according to the United States media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should bother us.
We didn't have time to think that 2017 could no longer get worse, there was a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots.
Yeah.
Sex robots are now the focus of attention.
The Responsible Robots Foundation (FRR) recently issued a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharka, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must take their emergence seriously.
Users can choose the eye color of robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about this, but firms are already sending them to their consumers in large numbers, and we'll soon see a lot more," said Akki on the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflated fellow workers to robots with silicon skin, warm to the senses, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also “adjust” their robots by choosing from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have "personality" by which the Stepford wife would be very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicon skin.
For example, RealBotix Robot allows users to adjust the quality they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxy Gold's sex robots, developed by the "True Company", which are delivered with a preprogrammed identity - for example, "The Cold Farra" seems shy, and "Discussion Wendy" has a "cautious" character.
"Roxy Gold has a character that fits yours" -- enthusiastically reports "True Company."
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't like, and so forth.
She's having a change of mood over the course of the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk or she may be "in the mood"!
In the emergence of sex robots, there's a lot of concern -- not least because they replace real human relationships -- but the biggest concern is the subordinate image of a woman, the association with rape, which causes the possession of the cold (read: resistant) Farah.
The "True Company" site compares Roxxy to a vibrator only for men.
"If a woman has a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality to the desire of sex with submission as an option supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the margins of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the peripheral can be very educational as to the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are neither stupid nor aggressive until a free market allows them to do so.
It's no coincidence that these complex sex robots came into play when women's rights around the world were threatened when the president in the White House boasted of being attached to women.
The most scary thing about "The Servant's Race" series is not graphic images, twisted bodies and distraught eyes, namely, how realistic this vision seems to be.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem that big right now.
The aim of the sex robots industry is to achieve the physical parallel of real women (only with the proportion of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like people to feel, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's not like robots look like real women.
They can't break up with or leave their partners.
They don't have a life or a life story -- nothing that could point to independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful rabbis.
Or, as they say in 2017, female servants.
A member of Los Angeles Eugene (Puch) Jeter, who has been in favour of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the basketball championship in Europe, the final part of which begins on 31 August.
Andrey Swanev, the general manager of the Blue-Yellows, reported this to the BeBasket portal.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately, he's not coming for family reasons.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
I recall that with the direct involvement of Jeter, Ukraine's team took its sixth highest place on Eurobasket-2013 and first hit the world basketball championship, where the yellow-blues were unable to overcome the group stage and the U.S. native gained, on average, 15.4 points for the game, 3 sets and 5 broadcasts.
Jeter has ceased to speak in favour of Ukraine since we resigned from the post of chief coach of our national team, the American team Mike Fratello, who resigned in 2015.
The male Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will play their team tournaments on Earth with a promise.
Trusted Eugenia Murzin, group B, will have five team members: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our male team held two check-ups in which it gave way to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Tramp's great feat?
I think it's very reasonable to make a picture of Mita Romney.
During the Trump era, it was common for political disputes that polarized the American electorate to break up at microlevel some families.
Between Christmas Day and Christmas, U.S. newspapers wrote down columns about how to deal with the terrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're about to burst.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about this because my cousin, the left-wing poet from Chicago, who had been on knives with Republicans in her family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that joining in the fight against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
At Trumpe in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother, with whom she argued about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely ended up on the same side.
At dinnertime, that is certainly good; but I cannot help but think that in the broader context, it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed forces into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trumpe and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we'll stop hitting his exits.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump “reforms” the right-wing republicans who, against the background of its standards, suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I've realized that I miss Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness today with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14% income tax (but we at least knew what his tax declaration looks like) - compared to Trump and both of them seem like a very small evil.
When Trump is gone, the next Republican candidate will have enough to be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the central park carousel -- the largest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't want caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the glass-glass images on the central drum -- the thunderous clowns and the animals, who look in horror at their back -- are extremely ominous, and the music that goes off is strangely exciting.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: skyscrapers are getting out of date, silhouettes of buildings are too busy to be awe - inspiring, and the reality of the city is short of dreaming.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day when I learned that the Suisse Cottage area is not really a Swiss shale, but a big round intersection in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, a eleven-year-old child and two women can have a great time in 40 years.
If I could put carousleys on the score, I'd put a five, but fortunately, no one asked me to do it.
And in the department store this week, I've been asked to do a terminal card assessment of my shopping experience on a scale of one to five stars.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's still plus the option to have 15% of teas scored at the desk.
As a result, not only is the neutral interaction slowing down, but it also has to be personalized in a situation that does not imply it.
The poor storegirl in the department store smiled inconsolably while I was tired of evaluating my experience in giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain
Pistorius is leaving prison for the second time because of a visit to a doctor.
Last year he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which the prison authorities claimed he had received as a result of his fall into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office for an initial sentence for an unintentional murder.
He killed Stancamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting at her several times through the door of the toilet room in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he had taken his friend for a night thief hidden in his bathroom.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office announced its intention to protest again, this time against the six-year period of Pretoria, which she said was too soft.
The Attorney-General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be heard this year.
The period of Pretoria could be extended by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor ' s Office was successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
A non-departure subscription was selected for the alleged beating of a NTV journalist
The capital law enforcement officers chose a preventive measure in the form of a non-departure certificate for the man who attacked NTV journalist Nikit Razjav during a live broadcast from Gorki Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TTSS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irinu Volk.
“In the context of an investigation into a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Congo (“Bobbies”) against a 32-year-old man who attacked the person of a correspondent on a television channel in the Central Park for the Culture and Recreation of the Name of Gorky, the suspect has been given a preventive measure in the form of a certificate of non-departure and proper conduct”, specified Volk.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative report had been prepared against the suspect for police disobedience.
On Wednesday, 2 August, a man approached the correspondent during a direct airstrip on the WWI Day and hit his face.
As it later turns out, the hooligan has nothing to do with the VCW.
According to Razzaev himself, on the contrary, the agents tried to arrest Moscow.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tenting
According to a report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tenting.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people who had set up tents in a fixed place, including two Bulgarians, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released the same day, while the consequence is still coming.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the BBC TV channel that Bulgarians had been released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping and have already imposed serious fines on all who are caught while parking in a non-existent place.
The audits will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court could impose a fine.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia accused the U.S. Vice-President of rhetoric during the cold war.
Statements made during the European tour of the United States Vice-President, Michael Pens, were criticized by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly moving towards primitive ideological images of the cold war, which are totally devoid of reality”, says a statement by the Russian foreign policy department.
At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for example, Pens' words about the "Russian threat" and the attempts to force the crossing of the borders he had told in Podgorica were echoed.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out the destructiveness of the choice “or with the West or with Russia” and the implausible notion of the alleged non-alternative entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to reject Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“We call upon United States colleagues to terminate Russia’s secular and foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and a willingness to work together in a constructive manner, on mutual interest”, states the statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Feldshire was injured in an ambulance accident in Podmoskovy
The accident occurred in the Locust Stupino, resulting in the impact of an inomarca with an ambulance, which was hit by a medical officer.
Today, about 08:10 msk, Mitsubishi's car crashed with an ambulance in the city of Stupino Moscow.
“The fast-track car was turned over as a result of the collision,” said TASS in the Ministry of Internal Affairs Press Service in the Moscow region.
Law enforcement officers work on the scene and the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In Odessa province, a woman dropped her newborn son on the construction site, turning him into a cellophane bag.
On the evening of 3 August, a local resident reported to the Division of Police that he had found a package with a baby in a broken private house.
“The law enforcement officers and doctors who promptly brought the child to a medical facility have left at the scene of the incident”, reported to the head of the National Police in Odessa.
The medical authorities found that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of a umbilical cord.
A 36-year-old local woman was identified by the priority operational activities.
It is also established that a woman has three more children.
As noted in the Chief, the law enforcement personnel had not previously been involved in the family ' s work and had not been specifically accounted for.
The circumstances and reasons for the conduct are currently being determined by the police and will be followed by a procedural decision.
The infant is now under medical supervision.
As previously reported, in Nicolaus, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into a garbage pipeline.
Gregory Leps: "I'm breaking into battle, though 55 is not 30.
One of the most successful Russian essay artists, Gregory Lepp, will celebrate his 55th anniversary on Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke to the bearer of the story.
I remember what your "tantine" said.
A special tent in the Slaws, Gloria Heinor sings for a birthdayr, a powerful saluter over Moscow River.
You must have wondered how you would like to spend your next five-year-old.
Did your plans come true?
Speaking of a profession, it was a good time.
I've worked hard, I've been driving three tours all over the country, giving 120-130 concerts a year.
I made two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what we say 20 years ago.
The biological clock will not be deceived.
Drinking like I sang at 30 is getting harder.
Still, I'm breaking into a fight, and I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm on a different level.
You're with them and you're recording a new album, first in three years.
Yeah, it's working on it right now.
In fact, we've all recorded it in my studio and now we're gonna send it to the L.A. facility.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" on a single-name song written with Timothy.
She's not quite ready, so we haven't taught her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we make a video on it.
And we'll introduce the album in November to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
The great American drummer Chris Coleman has put his hand on your new record.
Do you think you wanted to get him into your garage?
I think Coleman is one of the world's greatest drummers today.
He came to my studio, recorded his lot.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a famous drummer involved in various projects).
But for long-term work in Russia, they set up, to say the least, excessive conditions.
It was about $35,000 to $45,000 per month.
Then I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found Max Malishev's great drummer.
Actually, it's better to feed yours.
Sometimes I want to go to any one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly listed internationally.
Western music magazines are written about him, and he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists has come, with another performing technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you can't come to the United States alone?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, to be honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm truly sorry I can't get to America.
I've told you many times I've been studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful you are.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that experience, schools.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not had the task that American musicians have always done.
They were striving for the best quality of communication.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
For some reason now, Britain and I have been denied entry for ten years.
But I'm still going to apply for a visa every year to the British Embassy so I can go back and work there.
The rest of Europe is favorable to me.
And by August, you're planning to have a concert in Monaco, not a registered concert, right?
Yeah, Monte Carlo has a good Sports Hall, and I was there once.
Now they're invited again, and as far as I know, all the concert tickets have already been broken.
At the Randeva Lyma Wykule, which will start on July 20th in Jurmala, will you go?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyme is a great singer and a great woman who has the ability to present herself and a beautiful wax and even whispers.
After the tours and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to Vladimir Wiesotsk's work.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be quite different.
I want to record about 80 to 90 songs of Ussotsky in the same feed as he did himself.
Just the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangements.
Our famous musician Timur Vedernikov will co-oppose me.
I'm going to try to get me involved in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it works.
You and Boris Grebenskev's songs gradually entered their repertoire.
Why don't you write down his album later?
Boris Borisovich is a fine man and an excellent musician.
I've crossed with him a few times and I've been asking, "Can I sing some of his song?
He said, "Grigory, I write songs for them to be fulfilled."
Please try, sing.
I think it's interesting to write down such an album.
As long as I don't have a job like this, but in the future, one or two years from now, if Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might be doing a project like this.
If you don't focus entirely on your production center.
I assume, before you realized his potential, you didn't sign contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're independent, well-beinged people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Seresha is a brilliant singer, I've invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he's got his own development strategy.
And now in my center, there's Alexander Panayotov, who I led at the Voice.
We've made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be most unfortunate if he did not reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm taking off the music videos.
I hope so.
And I'm also trying to advance other artists at my center, buying them songs, crying to poets, sometimes their tracks get turned by television and radio channels.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They're going to get a recording album, a couple of clips.
And then if they want to, they can go their own way, and I won't insist that they return their money.
I'd be pleased if one of them would make a commercial success and pay me the interest we agreed to in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, no one's going to be able to cover the oxygen.
Let everyone work, try, prove how I used to prove it.
If you're offered tomorrow a tour of Ukraine and are guaranteed entry into the country, will you?
I'm still being invited.
These are mainly closed activities.
And as for the big tour...
I'm a man of my country, a Russian, who was convinced to fly to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say we have to fly to some other point in the interest of the State, I'll fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that we have had this situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we are one people and must be together.
I'm sorry it's not going to work, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We've seen it like anywhere.
Thank you very much.
And with a few Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorac, Light Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine there is a great crowd of gifted people, and it is a sincere regret that they are now unable to reach out fully to a wide Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I'd love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slava Wacarchuk, and have a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at the moment...
Andrei Ohlopkova was dropped from the cosmodrome
As has been known by the report, the technical director of the East Andrei Oholakkov cosmodrome began work at the Khrunikov State Space Science and Production Centre (HKNPC).
In the past, he had been de facto building the East Cosmodrome, but because of disagreement with the management of the Land and Space Infrastructure Operations Centre (CECI), he had been transferred to a facility in Moscow Field to coordinate production.
Mr. Ohlopkov's replacement will not be available: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished and the function is scattered by CECI units.
That the Technical Director of the Eastern and Deputy Director of CENCI for Technological Development, Andrei Ohlopkov, took up work in KNPC Khrunikov, the top managers of a number of space industries, as well as a government staff member, told him.
"He's been working in the new post for several weeks," the "James" interlocutors in the industry have clarified.
It was not possible to obtain the CECI operational comment on Thursday and Mr. Khalopkov was not available for comment.
However, the information at the KNPC was officially confirmed.
He decided to move to the post of Director of Production Coordination, said in the company.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to work in CECI in 2013, serving in space forces, in particular in Baikonura, and in Pleseck, he served as the first deputy commander in the rank of Colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Ohlopkov became a member of the criminal court.
The investigation accused him of bribery: it was alleged that since his delivery, regional merchants had been given orders from the State but that they had failed to fulfil their obligations to clean up the separate parts of the carrier missiles in the Archangelian region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The technical development responsibilities assigned to it in CECI extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of the long-term cosmodrome in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview, “Howl” explicitly stated that the situation in the East “was critical as early as October 2013”.
The strategic error in the planning was that the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier rocket were planned for the same time and for the end of 2015.
In order to launch before the end of the year, the construction was completed six months earlier and the deadline was moved from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, CECI specialists have begun parallel installation of technological equipment at unstructured sites.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Ohlopkov.
Despite the risks and the actual transfer (in place of December 2015, the Union left only on April 28, 2016), this idea was justified, says a source on the cosmodrome: “Unless we'd still run from East and build”.
The Vice-Prime-Prime Minister of the Cosmodrome named Andrei Ohlopkova his "space Susan", but he was the one who almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
I remember Mr. Ohlopkov and direct: for example, in "Joseph" interview, he proposed that the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specströr) be removed as the only performer for the East and work directly with subcontractors, "Why do we have to put all the eggs into one Specialist basket?"
That idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CECI has assumed the responsibility of the general contractor to complete construction and installation work on the start-up and technical complex by the fourth quarter.
According to the October data, the reason for Mr. Ohlopkov ' s transition to a new place of work was the disagreement with the CECI management on how to complete the construction of the cosmodrome facilities and complexes and how to work with subcontracting organizations.
"It has been decided that this will be the best for all," says one of the top managers involved in building the East.
A government officer, in turn, calls the decision strange: “He was one of the best professionals to find equivalent replacements.”
According to the data, this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the launch will be abolished and its functions will be scattered by CECI units.
A two-profession programme will be introduced in music schools
In the future, students at children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the deputy director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Science and Education, Stavlov Golubenko can be re-read by students of repeated disciplines, and the question of paying for the rest of the second course is decided by means of special grants, which hands over the RIA News.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken over this issue, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow two occupations to take place, but at the same time will not contradict existing legislation in the field of education,” said Golubenko.
Last Friday, at the Sunday Chat, Vladimir Putin, with hisders at the Sirius Children's Centre, a student, Maria Andreev, reported that she was forced to pay for recurrent subjects in the second specialty at the CMM at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was studying violin and piano classes and was awarded competitions in both directions.
The Head of State recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian was detained on the wall
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man, Kirill N., is detained and, on the wall of the roof of a tall building, reports El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital city of Mexico City.
With the help of two unknown men, the young man crossed a three-metre fence into the Nestle office complex and made his own move to one of his towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
The young man was already on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security took him to the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It provides information as to whether the young man is legally present on the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, the video of a young man rising to the heights became popular in the network.
Users called the young man "spider-man."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help to ease the OVC.
Red meat and chocolate are commonly considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies suggest the opposite: A diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help to ease the symptoms of intestinal inflammation.
This incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leads to cripples and stomach swelling, chronic or bloody weariness, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While meat and dairy products are usually recommended to alleviate symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of the protein tryptofan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colónna, explained that intestinal immune cells ensure that harmful microbes from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of starting an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance while protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance is too severe for inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The experiments showed that mice with certain bacteria in their intestines are developing cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs a tryptofan -- one of the building blocks of a protein -- to start these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We've established a connection between one type of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptofane was contained in mice' diet, the more immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work for people: a combination of L. reuteri and triptofan-rich diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the intestine.
Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, after studying the variety of immune cell tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line but was held separately, did not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by intestinal microbioms of mice, bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the stomach tract.
The DNA of the intestine cells of mice has been segregated and six types of bacteria present in mice that have immune cells but are missing from mice that do not have them have them have been detected.
Muscles grown in a sterile environment that did not have good microbioms and did not develop this type of immune cell have L. reuteri, and they have immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in the liquid environment and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells released from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of triptofane processing known as indol-3-milic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tryptofan in mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptofan was halved, the number of cells also dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have cells that are as tolerant as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their stomach tract.
It is not known whether the byproducts of triptofane from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans as well as in mice, but in humans suffering from intestinal inflammatory intestinal diseases, defects were detected in the genes associated with tryptofan.
She says, "Perhaps we need to strengthen the development of these cells because these cells are dependent on inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines.
High levels of triptofane if L. reuteri is available may potentially increase their population.”
According to José Moureenho, Manchester United hired a “gnus” in the person of Nemania Matić
Manchester United hired a “gny” in the face of Nemania Matić, and considers José Moureenio after the para-defensor debuted in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
A player who had acquired 40 million pounds from Chelsea began with a victory at 2-1 in Dublin at the last U.N.A. Pre-Seclosure match in front of Super-Cub UEFA v. Real Madrid on Thursday and gave an impression of being a para-protector, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke out when they were satisfied.
However, since Matić had not participated in the pre-circuit tour of Chelsea in Asia, he was seriously lacking the preparations for the game and had endured only 45 minutes, which, according to Moureenia, required further development before the pre-premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, the genius of how he thinks, he thinks with football," said Moureen.
“We will help him prepare sooner than later.”
Like Matić, his new friends Victor Lindelof and Romela Lukak began playing at the Aviv stadium when Moureen started forming his main members by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Moureenio wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wished to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for having acquired three of the four,” he added.
"I'll be even more happy if they get me four out of four, but they've already done a lot for me."
Former leaders of the social democrats of Lithuania persuade them to remain in the ruling coalition
The former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, the ex-Primés Algiardas Boutkjavicus and Gediminas Kirkilas, and the former Speaker of the Seimas Social Democratic Party, Chelovas Jurchenas, appealed to the same party to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported in the Parliamentary Gazette, because of tensions with partners, the Union of peasants and Greens, a discussion has been initiated in the Social Democratic Party as to whether or not to remain in the ruling coalition.
The three senior experienced companions approached the same-party group with an open letter, which stated, inter alia: “The frustration of the Party's comrades with the results of the elections is understandable, but the coalition with the peasants has created for us, however not very easy, but the conditions for the further realization of the social justice goals set out in our Government's programme and for the preservation of the political domination of the left centre over right-wing parties.”
In the view of former party leaders, the debate so far “has been dominated by an emotion-based expression of opinion without specific arguments”.
The authors of the letter fear that their party ' s reckless actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
The disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
Mosgord reduced the punishment for disabled wheelchair Anton Mamaev from four and a half years of imprisonment to 200,000 roubles.
In the past, the convicted person was released from SIZO by a decision of the Timirasev court.
Mosgorud confirmed, however, that the accused was a criminal, since he had set up a robbery and the kidnapping of a motorist from a former Special Forces soldier.
Mosgarud reduced Anton Mamav's sentence to 200,000 roubles.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime and, accordingly, such a person must be prosecuted”, explained “Accompanied by the Spokesperson of Mosgorud, Ulyan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account the health of Mamaev, the factual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the Court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which punishment may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Majev Vasili Serostanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would justify a change in the severity of the act and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he was not satisfied with the decision of Mosghursud.
I'm disappointed with the decision of the court.
The only legitimate solution would be justification, intent on continuing to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not rule out appeals to the Court of Cassation of Mosgord and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights,” he said.
Remember, 28-year-old Anton Mamaev, who suffers from spinal muscle atrophics, became a criminal figure in the fall of last year.
A disabled person claims he bought a scooter from friends for 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, including the former Special Forces fighter, stated that the disabled and his assistant, Vasili Serostan, had taken their property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Chimirazev District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasili Serostan to three years ' imprisonment and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general regime colony (art. 162, para. 2).
After the disabled person was placed in SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Attorney-General ' s Office, the Commissioner for Human Rights of President Tatyana Moskalkov, joined the case.
As a result, Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO in mid-July by a decision of the same Timirasev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed against the decision of the first instance in Mosgord.
The UNF will prepare a report on the environment for the President
In 2017, the final “Forum for Action” of the National People's Front of Russia (OF) will address environmental issues, report to the “Visvestites” the source to the FON, and confirm the head of the executive committee of the Alexei Anismov movement.
He said that, as a result of the Forum, “frontontics” planned to prepare a report to the President on domestic environmental issues and to propose a strategy to address them.
The Izvidi's interlocutors in the FNL note that the report to the Head of State will contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the History, the final UNF forum will be held in the autumn.
The exact date has not yet been determined - it is usually aligned with the President ' s schedule, which is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key events of the FNL.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts, in Rostov-na-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will formulate systemic proposals to address environmental problems, as described by the “Study” interviewer in the FON.
The Co-Chair of the Central Staff of the Movement, Olga Timofev, who is chairing the Committee of State on Environment and Environmental Protection, reported that “phrontonics” would report to the Head of State on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of the Environment in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the “Forum for Action” of the UNF are likely to be combined.
During the year, we grew up to be a powerful team of environmental experts, saw legislative gaps and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of a report that we are preparing for the President as leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the “fronts” are also reporting on the work on the priority projects of the FON, as described by Olga Timofev's “Studyers”.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environment, environment and transport, Sergei Ivan, would also be invited to the forum.
He had previously participated in the UNF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
Within a few months, the Year of the Environment will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is to set up environmental mechanisms for them to work for years.
To keep those questions on the agenda, added Olga Timothyev.
Andrey Kolyadin, head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), noted that in raising environmental issues, the NPF is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they have offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives have been supported by the President,” said Andrey Kolyadin, the "Evidents".
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded at this time, which could give the regions additional impetus for development.
In the future, the regions will be able, with the assistance of the EPF, not only to solve their environmental problems but also to develop ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by a “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the waste dump in Balashich (already closed) and coal dust in the port of Navotka (a bill on the prohibition of open-transmission of coal in settlements, one of the authors is Olga Timofev).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for resolving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been established, the issue is further enforcement, as well as the position of civil society.
There is a need for clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State - the head of the philanthropic Foundation, Leonid Bochin.
HRC, leader of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergei Ziplenkow, in his conversation with the “Izvestites”, stressed that responsible social and business approaches were needed in order to solve environmental problems successfully; legislative efforts alone were limited.
As soon as society and business realizes that solving environmental problems is a much more strategic step, the situation will change, ” said Sergey Ziplenkov.
The expert emphasized that the tendency to change the trend that the violation of environmental legislation was a cost-effective solution for business should be reversed.
A British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and a car to blow his hand.
The British inventor was the first person in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he could open the door of his house, enter the office, and even set up a car with a simple handshake.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northham used a tiny chip between his thumbs and indexes, and now, through his firm BioTek, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives at the expense of technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from King's Office in Winchester, to ensure that the implementation procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is similar to a microchip used for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northham also replaces locks in houses and cars with a 300-pound-a-centre-a-currency chip for one lock.
The married father of one child has already installed technology in his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is in the driveway.
The White House report cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to records from the military forces provided by the magazine TIME, the White House's decision last month to push a Marine Helicopter into the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers $24,000.
The white and green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Martin One, when the president is on board, became a central element of the 17 July White House event showing American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pens and top officials of the White House examined technological products from all 50 states.
A helicopter in Connecticut was displayed next to a boat from the state of Man, a fire truck from Visconsin, and a vehicle from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter (HMX-1), the unit responsible for managing the helicopter, the White House Military Administration ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or FRAGO, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of the “unusual” event.
“I just wanted you to know that you are aware because it is an unusually widely publicized press event”, wrote the HMX-1 commander in an e-mail to his superior, the first Deputy Chief of Aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and remain there until the lawn is released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return the flight in accordance with the working hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the unit ' s guards remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records received by the “TIME” magazine whether the second crew was required as a result.
The Hetch Act prohibits federal employees from using State property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event was in conflict with the regulation.
“We asked, among other things, whether it was a violation of Hatch’s law, and we were told that it was not,” the commander wrote.
“It looks like you have nowhere to go”, the deputy said.
The event “Make in America” was declared an official event by the White House and was not covered by the Hetch Act.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the health-care reform that was then under way in the Senate and commended efforts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly new.
The presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to ask for them only in the interest of photography.
Trump had already been discussed in February, when the presidential plane had gone backwards during its first pre-election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and its Twitter account had been overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor.
“White house in awe of the American screening of products from 50 states made by American American workers from American materials”, said Linda Walters, Deputy Spokesperson for the White House.
HMX-1 crews often take training flights around Washington Agglomeration and South Lawn to train the U.S. President's transportation to the White House with accuracy to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training sessions at the White House.
According to an official, the flight carried out for the “Action in America” event was counted to the crew on the basis of the required training flights per month.
The unit ' s helicopters on that day also flew 11 additional hours as part of “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged with any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in a demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not account for the presidential flight budget and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Ministry of Defence temporary rates for fiscal year 2017, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records 30 minutes of aircraft in the air each way from its airfield based on the Quantico Marine Aeronautics Base in Virginia.
The White House states that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“To calculate the value of taxpayers based on an estimated rate of reimbursement is totally wrong,” says Walters.
“These indicative rates include personnel, services and many other irreversible costs, which are included in the annual appropriations.”
According to a study carried out in 2015 by RENDC, rates of reimbursement do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, services and expenses specified in the contract.
At the time, the former White House spokesman, Sean Spyser, spoke out to defend the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate this week things done in America,” Spice said.
“I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which has been worked on by so many Americans.
It is, of course, appropriate to draw attention to this.”
It was not clear if Trump was interacting with a helicopter while watching the South Lawn during the event, but he was definitely sitting in the driver's seat in a fire car.
Inside the White House Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking the press about his own fleet of company products.
“I know "Sikorsky very well," said the President. “I have three of them.”
Moscow will provide grants to the intensive care units of urban hospitals
Every year, Lifesaving Grants will be allocated to intensive care units and intensive care units of the capital medical clinic.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobinin, visited the Juda City Clinical Hospital.
During his examination of the clinic, he presented a letter of appreciation to Victor Procko, an orthopedic doctor, who was led by the most difficult operation of the reconstruction of the adolescent's feet.
Sergei Sobjane also described the decision to provide intensive care for urban clinics and intensive care units each year.
The funds will be directed towards encouraging doctors and nurses.
According to the capital city town hall, the Jewish Clinic Hospital is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new sophisticated equipment to enable its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the Columbia Rural Hospital.
At present, health units are designed to accommodate more than 1,000 patients.
In addition to resuscitation and hospitalization, there are day offices.
The staff of the hospital is 2,800.
The total area covered by medical care is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the medical facility became a member of the short-term hospital pilot project (SCP).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
Surgeons use advanced medical equipment to significantly reduce the time frame for the rehabilitation of patients.
After surgery they spend only a few hours in hospital.
In the first six months of this year alone, 36,000 patients were provided with inpatient care at the Juda Clinic Hospital.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15800 operations to varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported that there were no buyers of the Ukrainian “daughter” Sberbank
In Nazbank, Ukraine (NBU) reported no requests for purchase of the Ukrainian “daughter” Sberbank.
This is reported on Friday, 4 August by TASS, with reference to the representative of the NSA press service.
The NBU confirms that on 3 August 2017, Victor Prokokeni, a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, issued a package of documents to agree on the acquisition of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares, indirectly (through Paritetbank).
“No documents were received from other potential investors to buy Sberbank shares in the U.S.S.U.”, the communication states.
On 3 August, a Belarusian businessman, Victor Prokolenya, withdrew the request to purchase a daughter-in-law of Sberbank.
On 28 July, it was reported that Nazbank Ukraine had denied Russian businessmen Said Guceriev and Gregory Guselnikov the acquisition of a Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
The regulator based his decision on the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification to meet the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank reported selling his Ukrainian “daughter” to the Norvik Banka Consortium and a private Belarusian company in March of this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, the son of the Russian businessman Mikhail Güceriev.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
In the course of the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favour of their mothers ' organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, stated at the United Nations.
Elections can only be representative when all members of society, including women, are represented on Wednesday by the head of the UN mission to Afghanistan.
According to Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the office of Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Selections can be fully representative only if women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial and presidential elections will take place in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threatened to disrupt the electoral process, which coincided with the transition of international forces from military operations to the role of advisers.
In this year ' s elections, the authorities move peacefully from one democratically elected Government to another for the first time.
Hayes stated that enhancing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

In Venice, fines for inappropriate behaviour were tightened for tourists
The Venice authorities have tightened the fines for bathing in canals from Euro50 to Euro500.
For walking around the city in a bath or naked tortoise, the fine will now be 200 euros.
The Euro100 will be required from those who will set up a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas, with reference to the Association of Tourists of the Russian Federation.
It is also mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for inscriptions on Euro400 and for garbage Euro25.
Travelers will be informed of the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice by means of a special company known as "EnjoyRespectVenezia" in social networks, as well as through advertisements and posters on the city council website, on billboards and at the most concentrated tourist gathering sites.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Venice's tourism adviser, Paola Mar's fines will be transmitted to the country's embassies of violators in order to warn their compatriots against such errors.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she said.
In April, the Italian city administration reported plans to limit the traffic.
The number of tourists visiting the city centre is already well under way in Venice.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to observe the Festa del Rententore festival, only 60,000 guests were allowed to attend.
In addition, there is a moratorium on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.

FF released Lake from the post of Chairman of the Committee
On Wednesday, the Federation Council endorsed the statement by the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Victor Lakeov, and released him.
He remains a senator from the province of Khabarow.
An application for release from the post of Lakes wrote last week.
He explained his decision to the need for rotation and his desire to “change the pace of life”.
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.
Victor Lake has since 1996 submitted to the FF a legislative meeting of the Khabarovski province.
The Senator has been in charge of the Defence and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatya (East Siberia) for the establishment of fair tariffs for the use of electricity are beginning to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, the cost of electricity at low voltage for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the Decision of the Government of the Russian Federation on the amendment of the wholesale electricity and power market regulations and in the combined forecast balance between the production and supply of electrical energy (power) within the framework of the Russian Single Energy System for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation (No. 842), established indicative prices of electricity and power for the industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryat.
As a result, the cost of electricity for the drilling producers is reduced by a quarter, making life easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have beaten the thresholds of the Moscow Cabinets in a futile attempt to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkutsk region with that of the Angar hydropower cartridge emanating from Baikal, the main catchment area of which is Buryatia.
And it's only this year that progress has begun.
In March, the electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 roubles/kWh to 3.93 roubs/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by decision of the Federal Government in the list of price areas of the wholesale market for which the operation of the wholesale and retail markets has been determined, industrial consumers have moved forward.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/hour 1.01 roubles.
But no one dares mention at least the approximate date of the new tariff movements downwards for Buryatia.
The Office of the Attorney-General of Ukraine did not become frightened and arrived in Crimea.
A legend of electronic dance music, the Scoeter group flew to Crimea without fear of threats from the Office of the Attorney-General of Ukraine.
"The flight went well and tomorrow I'm going to have a concert," says RIA News, "the voice of the Eich P Baxter Frontman."
Previously, the German edition of Bild, with reference to the Deputy Attorney-General of Ukraine, Evgeny Enin, reported that musicians could be sentenced to up to eight years' imprisonment for coming to Crimea, which in Kiev was considered to be temporarily occupied by Ukraine.
Scooter's performance at the Balaklave festival, called #ZBFest, is scheduled for August 4.
#ZBFest is hosted by Golden Balka to celebrate International Champagne Day.
Scoeter, one of Germany's most famous groups, was founded in 1993.
Asa's last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scoother, the guests of the Festival will be Sergey Galanin and his group Sere Gha, as well as Garik Soukaev with Brigada C.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Catering Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in the McVité's factory in Glasgow
The Union requires guarantees from the managers of the McVité's bisque manufacturer because of his long-term obligation to produce in the Glasgow factory.
The GMB Scotland office reports that the company was silent about the future investment in the Tokros facility.
More than 500 people work in a factory producing, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea.
Pladis, owner of McVité's, reports that over the past few years, over 5 million pounds have been invested in the facility.
The company adds that in the event of any change in the operation of the facility, the employees and representatives of the trade union “will be the first to know about them”.
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the GMB Scottish office requested McVité's response to concerns that funding would not be launched for the modernization of production lines.
The senior organizer, Drew Duffy, stated: “The members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the head of the business needs facility and the investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross.”
Families have been working here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in the territory of the Great Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the growth of the subsistence minimum and the chronic decline in production, the East End Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of the McVité's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “the head of the Tokros facility only yesterday received a letter from the GMB Scottish branch, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with the employees and representatives of the trade union”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tokros with staff and representatives of the GMB, at which a number of issues were openly discussed.
We talked to the staff about how, as all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic environment, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this applies to all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“We have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tokros facility in recent years, especially in production lines and improved performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in the event of any change in work at this site, the employees and representatives of the trade union will be the first to learn about it.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosneffti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas supplies to the East petrochemicals Company (HNHC) should be connected to the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but no one would give instructions to Gazprom, like Roznefti.
Thus President Vladimir Putin of Russia responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the conflicts.
The Head of State drew attention to the need for the relationship between Rosneftew and Gasprom to be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Igor Sechin, chapter of Rozneffti, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said earlier that the lack of agreement with Gasprom on gas for WNHC jeopardized the project's duration.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gasprom on this issue is ongoing.
Gasprom offers to find gas resources from the Rozneffti perimeter, but we don't have such resources," Sechin added.
Recall that Rosnepht asked for permission to use gas from the Kyrina “Gazprom” field, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the East petrochemical Company.
In June, Gasprom stated that negotiations on this issue were continuing and there were “no sharp angles”.
Did SGW Barcelona warn of Neimar's transition three years ago?
A member of the League may regret his interest in Marco Verratty
Parry St. German will not stop pursuing Neimar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record of the three years ago?
The compensation proposal revitalized the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was ready to break the world record of the cost of the transition, more than twice the previous mark of Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is over, Neimar will be the world's most expensive player, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, as SGW offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week clean.
It is known that Barcelona, rather than rage over the proposal and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the Catalan club insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since he moved from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the President of SPLP?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that wished to lure one of the best players in SPM.
“I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll take action against them, we'll make proposals to their players,” Al-Haleifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences.”
Barcelona appears to have crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in Marco Verratty's semi-defense defender.
SWW made it clear that he would not release the Italian player under any conditions, and it was likely that Barcelona felt the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neimar.
Putin has been assigned to deal with the payments of forest fires to the victims.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has instructed that material assistance be provided to forest-affected residents and that new housing be built.
I'd like to hear work today.
In particular, I should like to report on the situation with regard to the payment of compensation to the affected citizens.
I have a bit of a difference.
“I would also like to ask relevant colleagues about how much money has been allocated”, Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the Baikal regions.
On 4 August, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Natural Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the Presiding Representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Sibir Federal District, Sergey Menilo, and the Chief of the Baikal Branch of the GTB Glavarybvodow, Leonid Mikhail.
They described the work done to clean up the lake.
The boys were then shown in an open container next to a container that had been prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin released a few boys from a sledge.
Then I pulled a special lever on the cover of the container and released the others.
Also during the visit, the leader commissioned the environmental situation on Baikal and built a road on the island of Olhoon.
According to the Ministry, one volume is needed, and the volume is supposed to be different.
"I want to figure out what actually happens to us with funding," the Russian leader emphasized.
It will be recalled that during the 2017 forest fires, the population of Buryatya, Irkutsk region, and homes and buildings were destroyed.
In Ukraine it was proposed that Russians be sent to prison for illegal border crossing

According to Loza, foreign artists who allow such claims need not be invited to Russia.
Moreover, Loza believes that Manson should be "done" for what he said.
Recall that an American artist, noted for his empathy, spoke harshly about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Previously, on Thursday's "Arbitrations of the Week" wrote that Manson's statement commented on the domestic producer Joseph Pregozin.
