Members of the Wales Assembly do not want to “go to maps”
Among some members of the National Assembly, the offer to accept the acronym of MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament) as a member of the Wales Parliament will be welcome.
A problematic solution relates to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this acronym.
One Lebourist, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “fixed Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, not from Wales: Walli twp means dead, and pwp means pwp means duck.
According to the Assembly member of the Wales Party, his organization as a whole was “unsatisfied” and proposed other options.
Conservatives “don't object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close to Muppet (Mappet).
In this context, the letter w in the Welsh language is spoken approximately as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting a law on change of name, made the following statement: “The final decision as to what will be called Members of the Assembly will, of course, remain behind them”.
The Wales Governance Act of 2017 has the power to change the name of the National Assembly of Wales.
In June, the Committee published a public opinion survey on the proposed options, according to which the option “Parliament Wales” replaced “the Assembly” was widely supported by the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members option, while the MWP version received the greatest public support.
Members seem to suggest other options to the Assembly, but the presiding member, Elina Jones, will find it difficult to find a solution acceptable to all, and we will recall that the draft law on changes should be submitted within a few weeks.
The reform laws would include other modifications to the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on the disqualified of members of the Assembly and the Committee ' s system.
Members will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the draft law.
The Macedonians will vote in the referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia will vote for the country to be renamed “Republic of Northern Macedonia”.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims against the Greek province and has repeatedly opposed the accession of its northern neighbour to the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, opposed to the change of name referendum, stated that he was not going to accept its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the name of the country is the only price for joining the EU and NATO.
Garlem Crise: St. Martin’s bells have been silenced forever
“The old neighborhoods with which I spoke said that there had been a bar and a church at every corner before,” Adams explains.
“And now there is no other.”
The disappearance of bars is yet to be understood:
“The forum for communication has changed”.
“Bar has ceased to be a kind of living room throughout the area where regular visits have taken place.”
But in the case of churches, it is a matter of concern that the funds received from the sale of assets will not last long, however much the leaders put their trust.
At the church site, he added, there would be a multi-family house whose tenants were unlikely to support the remaining parishes in the area.
“The majority of those who buy these apartments will be white,” Adams says. “This will bring the day when such churches will finally close because new neighbours will never be their followers.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black area: Metropolitan Communit in 1870 and St. Martin’s church 10 years later.
The first members of the Methodist Church left in the 1930s.
Their building was purchased by a black coming from the neighborhood.
When the Church of St. Martin came into the hands of the Black Community, it was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, the main trading artery of Harlem, where he refused to hire or promote blacks.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by the fire, and during the reconstruction work, Johnson's followers ordered a carillon installation.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson's father, who succeeded him as the head of St. Martin's church, proudly called the carillon “the colles of the poor”.
But the expert who tested the carillon in July called it otherwise: “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that it was the carillon of the Church of St. Martin that was the first of its kind in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Linde. He was invited 18 years ago to play a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriwater, St. Martin's church has not yet replaced him.
The past few months have seen a difficult situation with architects and contractors around St. Martin’s church, some of whom were invited by secular church leaders and others by the Episcopal Church diocese.
The congregation, the governing body of the parish, which included secular leaders, went to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to transfer the cost of work” to the congregation, although the latter were not involved in the selection of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation expressed their dissatisfaction at the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a 13-year-old diver was injured by a shark mining lobsters
Official sources reported that on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, a 13-year-old diver was attacked by the shark and injured in California.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near the Bicon Beach beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel, in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), on Saturday morning he dived with his friends and heard the boy's cries for help after about half an hour, and with his friends, they sailed on the boat to the scene of the attack and pulled the young man out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was delighted to catch the lobster, but quickly “knowed that he was screaming, ‘ They bit me!
I've been bitten."
He went to the diver, Hammel noticed that “he had a completely severed skin around his collar. ”
“I shouted that everyone should get out of the water, ‘There's a shark!’ ” Hammel explains.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Redie Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The species of shark attacked a teenager is unknown.
A rescuer, Captain Larry Hailes, reported in a press briefing that a shark had been observed here a few weeks ago but was not classified as dangerous.
He also added that the victim of the attack had been injured in the upper torso.
The authorities closed the zone from the Ponto beach in Casablanca to the Svimi beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
He noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to conquer the British Parfumeric Cosmetic Market
Sainsbury is going to establish space and perfume units at Buts, SuperDrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetic consultants, following the lux department store model.
The British Parfumer-Kosmetic Market is estimated to be £2.8 billion and is continuing to expand, while the fashion and products for the house of sale are falling; space departments of cosmetics and perfumes will be represented in 11 shops throughout the country in order to capture a large proportion of this desirable market, and they should be expected in many other shops next year if successful.
Supermarket owners are looking for ways to fill the previous television, microwave stoves, home goods and investment in the perfumed cosmetic market.
According to the representatives of Sainsbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetics to 3,000 items; for the first time, stamps such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be proposed.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in dedicated locations, by type of organization of goods at Butes shops.
In addition, the Boutic-Kosmetics office will be reorganized to meet the needs of young buyers.
The two Sainsbury shops will be represented by the perfume producers Fragrance Chop, the first of which has already opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second is expected to be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
The Internet trade and the tendency to buy small quantities of food every day in small benches near the home have led supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President Sainsbury, says that the athletes will gradually turn into a department store, and his supermarket network fights for buyers in competition against cheap shops, such as Aldy and Lidle, offering more services and non-food items.
In hundreds of supermarkets, the Argos Auteles are located in Sainsbury, and in some of them it is now possible to find Habitats since the network bought both stamps two years ago, which led to an increase in the sales of food products and proceeds from these purchases.
The previous attempts at the supermarket to give a new life to its cosmetics and pharmacies departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Sainsbury and Buts was organized, but there was a disagreement between participants on the distribution of proceeds from the sale of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Sainsbury Pharmaceutical Business (a total of 281) by Celecio, owner of Lloyds Farmasi, 125 million pounds three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a wide line of luxuries for the care of the skin of La Roche-Pasay and Vichy in four shops.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our departments of perfumery and cosmetics into a better environment for our buyers.
We have also invited trained consultants who will always be ready to help the Council.
Our brand range for any taste, pleasant design and comfortable shopping will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumers, which will be a brand new concept of shopping."
Peter Jones responded to Holly Willoughby's release from the deal by £11 million.
Peter Jones's "Low of the Dragon" show was "frightened" by Holly Willoughby's 11 million-pound deal, which she intended to make with Peter's Lifestyle brand, but preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV instead.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their joint brand of household clothes and Truly accessors.
The business of this couple was compared to Goop actresses Gwynette Peltrow.
A 37-year-old lead programme, “Them in the morning”, announced its decision in the Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their profitable Leifstable brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV brought Peter Jones, the star of the Dragon Gods.
According to our sources, Jones was “gone up” when her favorite TV viewers at a busy meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after entering into new contracts worth up to 1.5 million, she would not have enough time on their common brand of household clothing and Truly accessors.
Their brand was compared to the kid's actress Gwynette Peltrow with the Goop mark, and it was expected that its sale would double Willowby's position, estimated at £11 million.
A 37-year-old headman announced her departure in Instagram, while Jones himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of her villas.
According to one source, “Truly was Holly's top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure its carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Its decision has led to the stratification of all parties to the transaction.
Everyone was amazed at what had happened on Tuesday, since weeks had passed before the stamp was launched.
At Marlow headquarters, there is an entire warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the leading British star Thism morning may cost the firm millions of pounds due to significant investment in goods, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay in launching the line.
It is also about breaking up long-standing friendships.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Cappe, for 10 years.
Willoughby created a Truly brand with Tara Cappa in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company's board in March.
Both couples often take vacations together, and Jones also owns 40 per cent of the company's television shares.
Willoughby will be the Ambassador of M&S and will replace Anthony McCarly as the leader of the ITV message, "I am a celebrity."
A source from Johns' neighborhood said last night, "We can't comment on his business."
Hard negotiations, "and then we fell in love with each other"
He was joking about the criticism he was being criticized by the media because of the “indecent President” comment and the positive assessment of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up such claims?
He said Trump, imitating the voice of the leading news.
“I did not give up.”
He noted that Kim Jong Eun had an interest in meeting again, after Trump had called them the first summit in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons stocks in North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have been stalled.
Three months after the Singapore summit in June, the high-level North Korean diplomat Lee Young-ho addressed world leaders at the Saturday meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, stating that North Korea was still waiting for a “appropriate response” from the United States following initial DPRK disarmament measures.
Instead, the United States, noted the diplomat, continues to use sanctions as a tool of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
“Nor Korea is doing a great job, ” he said. “
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions could have died.
And now we have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-Yin bore fruit: missile testing was stopped, hostages were released and American soldiers remaining in DPRK also returned to their homeland.
Speaking of his relationship with Kim Jong Ein, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not unusual.
“It is so easy for the President to be fit, but then instead of the 10,000 people on the street who are tearing into this hall, there would be only 200 people here,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd gathered before him.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction recorded, casualties estimated by hundreds
In the early days of the earthquake that struck Lombok, a foreign NGO said that there was no need for their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok ' s population had lost its roof, the Government did not consider it necessary to announce a national disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that there is no need for international support, so it was not easy,” says Celina Sambung.
Save the Children prepares the team for dispatch to Palau, but we do not yet know if the foreign group will be able to work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palau to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
Given the persistent seismic instability in Indonesia, the country continues to be terribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coasts.
Despite warnings of the tsunami threat, there was no siren in Palau to alert the population, which is likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
Transport between the many Indonesian islands is problematic, even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital previously moored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palau, but the road to the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo has made the strengthening of Indonesia ' s infrastructure the main focus of his electoral campaign and has spent invaluable resources on improving roads and railways.
However, President Joko ' s administration, which was running for a new term next year, had become confused about funding problems.
The President is also criticized for exacerbating interfaith hatred between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands more were killed as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other self-arrows.

The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, reported by the National Disaster Management Authority on Sunday morning.
According to reports, a large number of people remain under the ruins of buildings destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitudes on the Richter scale, which occurred on Friday and caused a tsunami of up to 6 metres high, reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the Office's official in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was overwhelmed by the wreckage of houses.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of causing fatal knife wounds to a woman
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead County this morning, and a murder investigation is under way.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 in Grayson Muse on John Street, suspected of murder of a 32-year-old man.
The police are looking for possible witnesses of killings among local residents.
Says Criminal Police Inspector O'Haigen: “Investigation is at an early stage, but I strongly ask everyone who was in the John Street area of Birkenhead to observe or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have recorded something on the video recorder, and ask for any information that could help the investigation.”
The police official confirmed that the victim had resided in Birkenhead and that her body had been found in the compound.
This afternoon, alleged familiar victims arrived at the scene to ask their questions about where it had been discovered this morning.
An investigation is under way and police officers are preparing to report the tragedy of the victim ' s immediate relatives.
A taxi driver living in the Grayson Muse complex tried to get into his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.

Cromwell's monument in front of the House of Parliament triggered a fierce debate about "history rewriting"
Cromwell's exile would be a well-deserved retaliation for the barbarous destruction of England's many cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, Cromwell's Memory Society called Mr. Creek's proposal a “surrender” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldmit, President of the Cromwell Memorial Society, stated: “In the context of the ongoing debate on the demolition of historical monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell was inevitably raised before the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English civil wars.
Perhaps Oliver Cromwell is suffering for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived centuries earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft reflects the view of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historic achievements of a man whom many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated: “Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case a monarchy.
Whether such an opinion is historically accurate remains the subject of debate among specialists.
But it can be said with confidence that the conflict that emerged in the mid-17 century affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be commended and respected.”
A killer pig killed a Chinese farmer
In a market in south-west China, a farmer was the victim of pigs, reporting to local media.
The victim's blood-blooded body (only his name is mentioned in the media, “Yuan”) was found with a broken artery near the greek in the market in Lupangshuy district of Guizhou province in southern China, as reported by Morning Post on Sunday.
The lead leader is preparing to inoculation pigs in the pig farm, on 30 May 2005, in Sinin County, Qinghai Province of China.
Yuan and his cousin came from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin found a smokeless body of Yuana, and the door to the neighboring pighead was opened.
In the pighole was a big snitch with blood on it.
A forensic examination found that a pig weighing 250 kilograms had killed a farmer.
“My brother’s feet were bloodthirsty and distorted, ” told the Guyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the victim.
Videos from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killing pig did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate squad during the investigation to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that the Yuang family is negotiating compensation with the market administration for the farmer ' s death.
There are few attacks by pigs on people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound-long animal drove a Wali peasant to the tractor and released him only after being frightened of his wife.
In 2012, there was a case where a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs, as Canada's CBC News had told him, pigs are not usually aggressive, but blood taste can act on their hidden aggression as a “download mechanism”.
“The pigs of the games,
They are tasteful and curious, but they have no intention of offending you.
You should just instill in your animal a sense of respect and respect, ” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to a large part of south-west USA
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to lose her strength by moving through a more cool zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring rains and floods into northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York, the cyclone reached category 1 with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 km south-west of Punta Euchanya (Mexico).
It is expected that the hurricane will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure zone is beginning to emerge over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the western coast of the United States, and nearing the coast of Baja California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico, south-west of the United States.
More than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Tropical humidity, which hits the emerging low pressure zone, is expected to cause heavy rains in the coming days in the South-West.
Rainfalls of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rainfall floods, muddy streams and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, high tropical humidity can cause rainfall to reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In parts of the south-west United States, most of the territory of Arizona is expected to reach 5 to 10 cm of rainfall.
The risk of sudden, rapidly developing floods due to uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
In the face of the current risk of tropical rainstorms, walking in the desert can have serious consequences.
Livs can turn canyons into brown rivers, and thunder can cause violent winds to blow up and dust clouds to rise.
The low pressure area on the coast of southern California is hit by torrential rains.
It is possible to drop up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small, muddy streams and create slippery road surfaces.
These are the first rainfalls since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, tropical rains will occur in Arizona and spread to other territories by Monday morning and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the downpours will have passed around the four corners and will last until Wednesday evening.
In October, the United States will experience rapid temperature swings, due to the low Arctic air temperature at relatively high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes this combination results in high temperatures in a small area.
Such extreme temperatures will be particularly evident in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and in Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Mynes, Iowa, varies by about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, summer heat will accumulate and spread to other areas.
In most of the central and eastern United States territories, warm weather is expected in early October, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees from the South Plains to the North-East.
In New York, air temperatures can rise to 27 degrees, 10 degrees above average, on Tuesday.
Our long-term forecast of weather promises an unusually high temperature on the eastern coast of the United States by mid-October.
The Senate hearing in Judge Bretta Cavanano ' s case was attended by more than 20 million viewers
The testimony of Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blazi Ford, who accuses Cavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, caught the attention of over 20 million viewers of six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition surrounding the claim of Cavanaugh continued unexpectedly, and on Friday, an urgent message was sent to the media: Republican Jeff Flake had made it a condition that charges against a lawyer be investigated by the FBI within one week.
As Ford stated at the Senate Legal Committee hearing, she was “100 per cent” sure that Cavanaugh had attacked her intoxicated and tried to put her on at a school party.
Cavanano gave emotional testimony, stating that 100 percent was sure that this was not the case.
According to the research agency Nielsen, there were over 20.4 million viewers watching Friday debates.
The Agency has taken into account average statistics from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data on the number of audiences of other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network are not yet available.
Moreover, Nielsen’s rating does not always include viewers watching TV at work.
By comparison, this is the middle audience following the U.S. football game at the playoffé or the Oscar ceremony.
The largest audience in the audience was Fox News Channel, whose leaders warmly supported the appointment of Cavanaugh: the Senate hearing lasted for an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
The second is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, the NBC was 2.94 million, MSNC watched 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, reports Nielsen.
After the hearing, interest in the matter was by no means weakened.
There was a real drama with Jeff Flake on Friday.
After the senator from Arison, considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support the candidature of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS were able to be sealed on the camera, as Flake met in an elevator on Friday morning on the way to the Legal Committee meeting with a group of activists who criticized the senator.
The whole world has seen him take his eyes off and receive a message from angry women live on CNN.
"I am standing before you," said one of them.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“The power behind you, while so many women are powerless”, tried to explain her position.
Flake told the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on the subject at the committee meeting.
When the Legal Committee had been preparing to confirm Kavano ' s candidature for the post of judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote several hours later, all television channels had been broadcast live.
Flake, however, made one condition: that the FBI investigate the charges against the candidate by next week, as the democratic minority had done.
Flake claims to have changed his mind with the intervention of a friend, a senator from the democrats of Chris Kuns.
He made the final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Flake's decision had been effective, since it was clear that the Republicans lacked the vote to claim Cavanaugh without conducting an investigation.
By decree of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses his critics of “political games” around the Brexith situation
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow-party interests ahead of public interest.
The British Prime Minister attends a conservative party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published on the same line of interview by May, former Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called “Chuckle” plan in Brexita, claiming that the introduction of customs duties between the United Kingdom and the EU was “totally ridiculous”.
Death of Wade Sims in a shooting incident: The police arrested Davon Simpson on suspicion of murdering the Forard of the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of shooting Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the University of Louisiana.
According to the Baton Ruja police, 20-year-old Davon Simpson was arrested and detained on second-level murder charges.
The police published a video recording of a fight involving Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, the regional channel CBS, the police discovered Simpson's DNA on the glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson confessed that Wade had been fatally wounded.
According to Advocate, $350,000 has been set aside for Simpson.
The Coroner for the Eastern District of Baton Ruza released a preliminary detention on Friday: death was caused by a cross-cutting combined shooting wound to the neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Criminal Investigation Division of the State of Louisiana, the State Police Criminology Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local population, who assisted in the investigation activities that led to the detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “precious work in arresting the offender”.
Simsu was only 20 years old.
A two-metre forard was born of Baton Ruge; his father, Wayne, also played on the team of the University of Louisiana.
In the past season, Seams had recruited 5.6 points and made 2.6 sets per match, on average.
Will Wade, a trainer, made a statement on Friday morning saying that Wade Sims' tragic death had caused a scoop and a real woe for all the players.
"That's what I've always been afraid of," added the coach.
The volcano covered Mexico City with ashes
Popocatepetl’s volcano covered the southern outskirts of Mexico’s capital with ashes.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention of Mexico recommended that the population should not approach the volcano: its crater recorded activity and produced 183 paragas emissions per day.
According to the Center’s observations, the volcano was often surrounded by thunder and trembling.
In some parts of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko, social media users published photographs of frontal glazing of vehicles covered with fine ash.
Following an earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which rocked central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded increased volcanic activity 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
Popocatepetl (or, for its own sake, Don Goyo) is an active volcano since 1994.
Clashes of police with Catalan separatists in anticipation of the first anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, Barcelona had a thousandth meeting on the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which had broken up the country into two camps, and had not been without clashes between supporters of autonomy and the police; six rioters had been detained.
Police officers pushed out the protestors of independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, threw eggs and powder paint into custody, raising the clouds of dark dust in the very centre of Barcelona.
The riots resumed with renewed force after the police sent the baton to deter the crowd.
For a few hours, independenceists scandaled: “We will not forget, we will not forget!” and their opponents answered with the slogan, “Hold Spain!”
According to local press reports, fourteen participants were admitted to a hospital with slight injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was declared illegal by the Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for the separatists, and a year later, tensions persist in the sovereignty-seeking region.
Catalonia voted in favour of a withdrawal from Spain with a great deal of weight, but the appearance was low because opponents of the withdrawal were predominantly boycott of the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, last year nearly 1,000 people were injured when police tried to block the referendum at the country ' s polling stations.
On Friday, separatists had to spend the night on the alleged route following a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration took place anyway, but it went along another route.
The 68-year-old electorate Narcis Termez, who visited a separatist rally in his wife's company, is saying that the hope of Catholic sovereignty is becoming ever more volatile.
“Last year, one of the most important events in our lives occurred.
My parents were crying for happiness when they were able to vote in the referendum, and today we are suspended, ” he said.
In the recent December elections for local government, the Catalan parties in favour of separation from Spain have won an important victory, albeit with little delay, but this year their movement has lost its supporters because many of the prominent leaders of the movement are either on the run or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanics who recorded a police support rally, said that the conflict was heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“Trembling up,” he added.
On Saturday, Oril Jounqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists who have been on pre-trial detention cell since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participating in regular elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and reprisals by the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderri: The car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested

The raid took place on Thursday at about 19:30 local time in the Ballinard Crecent area.

There are reports that a bow shot could have been fired into the car.
Livingston's victory over Rangers thanks to Menga's marked goal
The first goal of Dolly Mengi brought a guaranteed victory to the Livingston team
With the killing of the Battleston ball, it won an unexpected victory over the Rangers, and for the top coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Jarard, it's only a second defeat in 18 games.
The exact impact Dolly Mengi compared Gary Holt's team to the Gibernian club in a credit table where they divide the second place.
There was no victory in leaving this season of the Prime League, and on Sunday they will meet with the leaders of the "Harts" group, from which Rangers lags eight points behind.
On Thursday, Rangers will host a League of Europe match with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vienna).
The Livingston Club continues its win-win series in the division, playing six matches and not getting any hit since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as chief coach of the team.
Lost moments for Liwingston in interception with Naporous Guests
The trust coach Holt was supposed to keep an account from the very beginning — the Rangers were clearly not able to cope with their attack.
Scott Robinson was able to break through the line of defense, but the goal of his weak attempt didn't work out, and then the lawyer, Alan Litgow, went too far, and couldn't prevent Cage Hulkett's ball from getting on the net.
The host party allowed Rangers to play in front of their line of protection, counting on the dangerous moments at the resumption of the game.
That's how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers gave way to a free strike, and Liwingston took the opportunity to transfer Menge to Declan Gallagher and Robinson.
At that point, Rangers had an advantage in the possession of the ball, but the protection of the host team was untested, so Liam Kelly's altar was not concerned.
The second time continued according to the same pattern, although Kelly still had to strike Alfredo Morelos.
Allan McGregorere kicked off Scott Pittman's ball, and Litgow made a big pitch out of the standard position.
They were constantly caught in the Livingston fine, but all the attacks were reflected, and two requirements of the toolbar were not met, one for triggering Glenn Middleton Hulkett's back-to-back player and the other for playing with his hand.
Livingston “Phenomenal” Game — Analysis
From BBC Scottland - Alder Lamont, report from Tony Macharoni Arena
Phenomenal game and excellent result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were brilliant and once again surpassed all expectations by continuing their rise to the football Olympics.
Their game style and composition haven't changed much since they went up to the top lines of the rating, and coach Holt's great credit for mobilizing this team from the beginning.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Khalket led an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
The Rangers could not enter the rhythm.
Although they had good game moments with Coach Gerrard, this time they failed to meet our expectations.
In the last few minutes, they've been missing the ball, and they've only been able to defend the host team once. The Rangers, who went down to the middle of the table, have something to think about.
Erdogan cool reception during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, there was fine weather, and both of them were in a good mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan ' s visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO member countries — a visit already associated with some conflicts.
Heads of country were unable to find understanding on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey ' s accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to attend a ceremony to open a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey lives in Cologne.
For security reasons, the police prevented a 25-thousand crowd from entering the mosque, but many of Erdogan's supporters set up nearby to see their president.
Opposers to the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered at the same location to condemn in full the policy of Erdogan and the decision of the German Government to invite him to Germany.
The contrasting views of the meeting reflect the mixed nature of the figure: many Germans with Turkish roots exalt Erdogan, while others consider him to be a tyrant.
Deptford road accident: collision with a car resulted in the death of a cyclist
In London, the car ran into a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred near Besuid Street and Evelyn Street, a busy intersection in the south-eastern part of Depfort, about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the ambulances who arrived were trying to help the cyclist, but the man died unconscious.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: only a mile and a half [1.5 km] from the scene, in Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver had fled.
The London Police report that work is under way to identify the deceased and to notify his immediate relatives.
In the meantime, roads are closed at the scene and the bus route changed: motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Disturbing in Long Laarten Prison: six police officers injured
According to Long-Lartin Administration, six policemen were injured during riots in a man's high-security prison.
At the Long-Lartin High-Level Men ' s Prison (Wustershire) on Sundays, riots continued about 09:30 local time.
To deal with the disturbances involving eight prisoners from the same wing, the Tornado operation was called.
The police were slightly damaged by the soft tissue of the person; they were treated locally.
According to the prison official, “specially trained officers have been recruited to deal with the incident in Long-Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their preventive measure may be changed for a longer period.”
Long Laartine currently has over 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported to the media that the prison manager was in a hospital when a prisoner was attacked.
In October of last year, the prison authorities were forced to engage special forces to calm down the scattered prisoners who had thrown billard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa may flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit the arid territories)
Arizona rarely enters the area of an intensive tropical cyclone, but this time it is “wishy”: at the beginning of the next week, Hurricane Rosa, with his last stroke, must pass over the desert of the South-West and carry the risk of torrential floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of torrential floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Hurricane Rosa will pass directly over the Fenix on Tuesday and will be spilled on Monday evening.
The Office of the National Meteorological Service in Fenix reported on Twitter that “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression since 1950 at 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 kilometres from the Arisona border.”
According to recent forecasts, the National Meteorological Service will fall between 5 and 10 cm in rainfall, reaching 15 cm on the Maholon-Rim Arison Plateau.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rockies and the Large Bassein, it is possible that up to 2.5 to 5 centimetres may fall, and rainfall may reach 10 cm.
The rains caused by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing for the areas that the torrential torrents are going through, for the region has long suffered from drought.
Although torrential floods may pose a danger, heavy rains can facilitate a dry season that does not take place in the south-west of the United States.
According to U.S. Drawt Monitor maps, more than 40 per cent of Arizona's territory is experiencing at least a severe drought (the second largest),” reports the websiteweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will strike the state of Lower California in Mexico.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane with a maximum speed of 137 km/h is 360 km south of Punta Euchnya (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane has found itself in a cooler zone on the Pacific coast and is thus losing its strength.
In the afternoon, a hurricane will reach Mexico under the category of “tropical storm”.
In parts of Mexico, it is expected that heavy flooding will occur.
“The area from Baja California to the north-west of Sonora may fall to between 7 and 10 centimetres of rainfall, with places up to 25 cm,” reports the websiteweather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will then head north across Mexico and reach the border with Arizona in the tropical cyclone category early Tuesday morning, from Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The main potential risks associated with Hurricane Rosa and its remnants are heavy rains in Baja California, in the north-west of Sonora and in the desert areas of the south-west of the United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
The rainfall is expected to cause dangerous rainfall floods, muddy desert streams and possible landslides in mountain areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four suspects of attempted murder are detained
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was severely stabbed and three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim of a serious injury attack was found in the Exeter Terras area of Midsomer Norton about 4 a.m. Saturday morning.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “sustainable”.
On the same night, four suspects, aged 17, 18 and 20, were arrested in Radstock district, reporting to Avon and Somerset County Police.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to the crime with any video records of a mobile phone incident.
Donald Trump: "All the hatred, all the anger" of the democracies has fallen on Cavanaugh.
“The voice behind Judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the democracies,” said Trump at a meeting of his colleagues in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump is of the view that in the process of approving Kavano's nomination, the candidate “has been subjected to all hatred, all anger” of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Cavanaugh testified in the U.S. Congress, in his emotional address categorically rejecting Christine Blaze Ford's charge that he had sexually obtained her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during her prosecution hearing.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that that day “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage” of Cavanaugh.
“The voice for Judge Cavanaugh's claim is the vote for the approval of one of the greatest lawyers of our time, with an unstained public record”, announced the president of the crowd of his fellows in West Virginia.
In his speech, the President indirectly addressed the issue of Kavano’s election, speaking of the importance of the appearance of Republicans for the Congress and the House of Representatives.
“There are only five weeks left for the most important elections in our lives.
I do not participate in them, but I do participate in the race in another sense,” he said.
“I am wearing my neck and fighting for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the democracies have set themselves the task of “resisting us with all our might”.
According to the rules, the first key ballot in the Senate, on the confirmation of Kavano ' s candidature, should take place no later than Friday, was announced by the Assistant High-level Representative of the Republican Party.
The Indonesian earthquake claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of casualties continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died and that many had been swept away by the huge waves that swept over the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which had been hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims were hundreds of visitors to a beach festival in the city of Palu, and on the west side of the coast there were waves nearly six meters high, all of which swept along and led to the instant death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When yesterday a storm warning was issued, people continued their beach rest instead of running into hiding immediately, and lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Office at a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunamis didn't come one way, there were cars in the stream, there were logs, there were whole houses, there was destruction on its way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami had crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and had hit the coast with great force.
Some of those present were taken to trees, which saved their lives.
Some 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palau.
The disaster management office has seen houses, shops, bridges and a flooded mosque being destroyed.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by underground pushes.
A series of earthquakes took place in an area of 2.4 million people.
The statement by the Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the earthquake-induced energy emissions were about 200 times higher than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected because of the geographic location of the city located at the end of the narrow Gulf.
Nugroho referred to damage as “large-scale”, adding that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the destroyed buildings; 540 were injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho added that the victims and the destruction could be even more significant along the coast to 300 kilometres from Palau, a part of Dungal, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications with Dungal were “completely destroyed and no information was received”.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the Dungal area”, states the communiqué of the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already gone to the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but this is not the limit,” the report says.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized because it did not report on the arrival of the tsunami in Palau in time; however, the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
A amateur video appeared on social media where a man on the top floor of a building screams at the approaching tsunami, desperate to attract the attention of people on the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying whole houses and cars.
The Reuters agency has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major depletion of the electrolines, which caused communication to be lost in Palau, making rescue operations very difficult.
Military humanitarian transport aircraft have been sent from Jakarta and other cities, but food and basic supplies remain scarce for the evacuees and Government sources report.
The airport of the city was opened for humanitarian assistance only; it will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palau.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the charity organization World Vision arrived safely from Dungala in Palau, where the staff found a shelter in the canvas tents that had been broken in the yard of their office building.
“They saw huge numbers of houses destroyed,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charities have begun to implement humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that international NCB experts have not been able to reach Palau.
Indonesian legislation permits funding, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations only after the declaration of a disaster site as a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that this is a local disaster,” says Aulia Ariani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares a natural disaster national, we will be able to accept foreign assistance, but for the time being the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Palu, friends and relatives of the people who were missing still look forward to their miraculous salvation, which will restore the people to their faith in the best.
On Saturday, a little boy fell into a sewerhole was saved.
On Sunday, rescuers took a woman who had spent two days in the building near her mother's breathingless body.
Hendon Subandono, coach of the National Paraplanerism Commission of Indonesia, prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among the other people who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his disciples, including Mandagi.
"I'm not the last person in this sport, and it's emotionally hard to survive," he said.
Hendon recalls that when he learned of the devastation of Roa Roa from other paraplaners, he tried desperately to contact his colleagues from Palau at a beach festival during the next hours.
However, his reports were displayed with one gray tick, not two blues.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he believes.
Slight theft of $26 750 while maintaining an ATM in Newport-on-Livi
On Friday morning, abusers stole $26 750 from the Brink's boxer, who runs one of the ATMs in Newport-on-Livi, says a press release by the Newport Police.
According to researcher Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armoured minibus took the cash out of the ATM located in the entertainment complex and was about to refuel it with new notes.
During this time, "Brink's officer was hit by an abuser" and stole a bag of bank notes to refuel an ATM.
According to witnesses to the incident, several suspects had fled the crime scene, but the police had not indicated the number of potential participants.
Citizens who have any information about these individuals are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at No. 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Repper changed his name to Yee
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Ye.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
41-year-old West has long worn it as a pseudonym and has even named it his eighth album, which came out in June.
News of this occurred in the run-up to Kanye in the Sunday Night Live program, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kanje West will act as a co-convenor instead of Ariana's singer, who has cancelled her participation because of “emotional experiences”, the author of the broadcast reports.
West had previously stated that the pseudonym was not only a shorter version of his name but also a religious one.
"You are the most common word in the Bible, meaning "you," "you," so West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with a radio broadcaster, Big Boy.
"I am you, I am us.
First there was Kanye, which means "one", and now I'm just Yee, which is the reflection of all the good, bad, incomprehensible things in us, all at once.
And an album is an attempt to figure out who we are."
Kanier's not the first famous rapper to choose to change his name.
Sean Combbs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or simply Diddy, this year asked for his name Love or Braza Love or Brother Love.
The rapper of J.Z., speaking to West, also changed his name several times: a dash without capital letters or letters.
The President of Mexico solemnly pledges not to use military force against the civilian population
The President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, vowed never to use military force against the civilian population in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which ended in a bloody confrontation.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, President López Obrador promised “never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On 2 October 1968, during a peaceful demonstration, the students fired their first shots in the crowd and a massacre took the lives of 300 people, against the backdrop of the upsurge in the left-wing student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also pledged support to Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship for study and the opening of more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of learning opportunities are leading young people directly into a criminal world.
The United States needs to double its funding for IT development.
China and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (IIA) should not be underestimated — the United States should double its investment in its scientific development, as Li Kaifu, investor and business in the development of IPs with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Several U.S. ministries had previously made statements about the work on the MI, although the US as a whole did not have a clear strategy for the development of the MI.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to become the first innovation of the MI by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for IT research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we expect the next breakthrough in MI,” says Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the chance that the next major achievement of the I.I. would be made in the US, said Lee C.C.C.C. in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Houchton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most remarkable companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Mello, he was working on a system of artificial intelligence that was higher than the highest player in U.S. Otello, and then he was head of Microsoft Research and president of the China branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Robotics Challenge Agency Defense Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be held to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“China does not consume academic leaders, but corporations,” Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the US develop artificial intelligence.
“I think Green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State published a plan to develop the artificial intelligence of the next generation.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences provides funding to scientists in a similar way to the way that the National Scientific Foundation and other governmental organizations contribute money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li argues.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, in which partners from industry and academia should participate, and the White House announced the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the programme called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in I.I.I. research.
Meanwhile, US legislation, which had sought to establish the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, had not taken any action in that regard for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum about whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the name of their country should be changed to “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would allow for the resolution of a multi-year dispute with Greece, which had blocked its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, of which Macedonia is a province, claims that its northern neighbour ' s name is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on the new name, but opponents nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether voter turnout would meet the 50 per cent minimum required for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was as follows: “Will you support NATO and EU membership, subject to a treaty with Greece?”
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the break-up of Yugoslavia, is worth paying this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” relates a 79-year-old Oliver of Georgia, a resident of Skopje.
The sufficient number of members of Parliament stated that they would respect the vote to make it decisive, although not legally binding.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority of members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1100.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe”, says 62-year-old Yose Tanevski, an elector from the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and his son, Dosko, voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the question of changing the name of the country, which would open the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Stramica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the Parliamentary House in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, age 54, prepared a small scene by placing chairs in front of tents installed by those citizens who intend to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and EU membership, but we want to join with the head of the high-level office rather than the thresholds of the Cabinets,” says Kawadarkov.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-esteem.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries such as China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring investment in Macedonia, which was so much needed by that country, where the unemployment rate was over 20 per cent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” said Zaire after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “the cornerstone of our secure future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but this is below the required turnout.
In another survey conducted by the Macedonian Channel Telecom-TV, 57 per cent of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of that number claimed to vote positively.
For a referendum to take place, the appearance must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major attack on the policies of the Western Government since it came to power last May.
See, Sergio Aguero of Manchester City is around Brighton's defense to kill the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling fought against Brighton's defense, bringing Manchester City to victory at 2:0 Saturday at Tsehad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero hit a 65-minute goal, it seemed like he had no difficulty.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker got a pass in the center of the field.
He ran between three Briton's defenders before breaking into the open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He circled over one defender and overthrew several more on the edge of the Briton penal zone.
Then he handed the Sterling ball to the left.
The English attacker, while in the penal zone, turned Aguero's ball to one end, who, on his right leg, hit Matthew Ryan's Briton's altar at the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero has had some problems with his feet”, said coach Manchester City, Pep Guardilla.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he hit a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blue the initial advantage in the fight against the Prime League.
That goal was scored for 29 minutes.
At this game, Aguero got a ball deep inside Briton.
He gave a great cut to the left flank on Leroy San.
Sana's made a few contacts before putting the Sterling on the far side of the trouser.
The attacker, Heavenly Blues, hit the gate just before flying out of the field.
Manchester City fought Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 in Rhine-Nekkar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer's going to pick points from Colorado Roquis.
After Washington Nashionals left the battle for playoff, there was no particular reason to force events.
But the untiring Sherzer hopes to win the battle against Colorado Roquis on Sunday, but only if Roquis has problems in playoff in one Los Angeles Dodgers game in the West Division.
The 5-2 victory over Nashionals had already won at least 7 or 8 seats on Friday evening, but they were still hoping to obtain title in the first division.
“Even though we play it just like this, at least we can maintain our position by knowing the enormous importance of the Denver atmosphere in the presence of the audience and another team, which is probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss it?’
Nashionals has not yet announced a petrier on Sunday, but according to recent data, Sherzer is likely to be exposed to this role.
Sherzer, who's about to go out for the 34th game, was throwing a ball at the play area on Thursday, and on Sunday, he's gonna be a pilot.
The right-hand player, Washington, is 18-7 rated by ERA 2.53 and 300 auts by 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
Trump runs a pre-election race in West Virginia
Referring to the importance of the appearance of Republicans in the interim elections, the President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavano, a candidate put forward by the President to the Supreme Court.
“All that we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t run, although I’m really running around fighting for good candidates, ” he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see that this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means are necessary, and we see meanness and disgustingness.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, who they have to cross to get power and control, which is what they want to get -- power and control, but we're not going to give them back."
The democrats, he claims, were aimed at “resisting and impeding”.
“And you have observed it over the last four days,” he said, calling the democracies “wicked, mean, mean and false”.
He referred to the Senate's Legal Committee by referring to Senator-democratic Dainn Fainsstein, which caused loud cries from the hall.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow this document to leak?
Mmm... mm-hmm, what's the document?
No, no, the tongue of the body has delivered it, I have never seen the tongue of the body so refuting words."
The Labour Party is no longer an organization of differing views.
It shows no tolerance for those who express their views
When Momentum activists in my local party made a proposal for a vote of mistrust to me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last member of Parliament from the Labour Party to be told that we are not welcomed for expressing our views.
A similar attitude to my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe are ironically matters on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification of the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the time I was eight years old as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party, the GC evenings were just like this.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not in line with many of the meetings, and the promise of a “more human and soft” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that there are no differences of opinion in the Labour Party is becoming increasingly apparent, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the party ' s leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own, expected me to change my views and adopt positions that I would never agree with — whether national security or the single EU market.
Every time I make a public statement — and I do not care what I say — there's a barrage of insults on social media calling for the abolition of elections that condemn the policy of the centre or that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments to me still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who daily face the flow of sexual or racist attacks, but who never shrink back.
The most disappointing thing about this policy is that this number of insults has become a norm.
Last week Jeremy Corbin stated that the Labour Party must develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a “wide church”, and with every passing of mistrust or change in the rules of choice, the party is already becoming a party.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations that encourage me to sit quietly and speak up, and then I will be fine.
But I didn't come into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labourists 32 years ago, as a student of a school that was outraged by the Government of Thetcher, which literally led to the dissolution of my school class, I have sought to promote the highest standard of public services for those most in need, be it the work of a local deputy or a government minister.
I never hid my political views; I didn't do it in the last election.
No one in Notting East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say this: our country is moving so hard towards Brexit, which will securely cause economic, industrial and State damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are Labourists or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of abrogating the results of the elections or political expediency will prevent me from doing what I think is necessary in your interest.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament from Nottingham East
E 38 - 17 Meloughs: Unconquerable "Er" comes first
Two late attempts may have distorted the final outcome somewhat, but Ere no doubt deserved a triumph in this amazingly interesting pre-Tenenent League match.
Now they lead the table, the only unconquerable team of tens.
After all, all because of their excellent protection, as well as their ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merci the right to be content.
“We have been tested for strength all this time, and we are still unconquerable, so I have no reason to be sad, ” commented Peter Merchi.
Robin Christie, Melrose, "It's worth paying back "Er," they've done better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fraser Climeau led Air forward, but a yellow Worrs card released by Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrows to move forward, while Jason Bagott seized the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased the "Er" cut from a fine before, right in the middle of the game, he earned a point and then interrupted by a single attempt at 17-5 in favour of "Er".
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggot reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious trauma of Rurid Knott, which had been stretched, and after the re-entry, Er moved on with Stafford McDauel's attempt by Climo.
The current "Er" Captain Blair McFurson then received a yellow card, and once again Melrose forced rivals to pay another player for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt, at the end of a period of violent pressure.
However, the owners returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to intercept Klimo without a ball from the line of fines, McFurson made a touchdown behind the coming mole of Air.
Climo realized the advantage without stopping almost once again, after Kyle Row had received a blow from David Armstrong and had sent the extreme attacker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the owners of the field.
Will Game's Star is going to start a new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game Ford Kieran's star is going to start working in the hotel industry: it's become known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor acts as Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, a script he writes to, and he's filming with Greg Hemfield's old comedy partner.
Duett announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the show, and Kirnan seems to be planning his life after Craig.
According to official information, he is the director of the Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the Scottish Sun source suggested that Kirnan was planning to participate in a “blossom restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Peace be upon us”: A landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings have blue flags.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked by the slogan, “Maritime is right.
It is our duty to return it.”
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, there is still a memory of the coastline lost in favour of Chile as a result of the 19th century bloody conflict over resources; and the desire to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been the boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by an international court to be held on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“We Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and a balance of mind and, of course, a positive outcome,” said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the judgment process before the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal at The Hague will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of intensive negotiations, Chile has an obligation to negotiate the granting of sovereign land-lock to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who fights hard for re-election next year, also looks forward to the Monday decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he claimed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia, and if it does, that will make little difference.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to dispose of Chilean territory and has already stated that it will have no influence on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was rendered only six months after the last arguments had been heard indicates that the case was “not complex”, says Pas Zarata, a Chilean expert in international law.
In the past four years, Bolivia's case has not progressed, but rather has been delayed.
“The foreign administration of Bolivia has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” said Zarata.
She said that Morales ’ military rhetoric had destroyed the last Chilean kindness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but discussions will then be extremely difficult.
The two countries have no diplomatic relations since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that the court ' s decision was rendered too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of mutual benefit differences”, he claims.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the naval problem as a political challenge.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he claims.
“The decision of the court is an opportunity to ascertain once again that we have to move through our past”.
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place until it can trust the US
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, states that his country will never go to destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly.
He called upon the United States to fulfil the promises made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments are received as U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of relaunching the impasse in nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Chen-Yin.
Ri claims that the dream that long sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever put the North on its knees is Utopia.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration unless Phenyang has taken substantial steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But scepticism over the fact that Pignian is seriously concerned with renunciation of an arsenal that the country may consider to be the only way to guarantee its security is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows show the latest line of massive head coverings that are promised to appear in mass sales and will be carried right next to you
If you want to add a hat to your collection or protect yourself completely from sunlight, you don't have to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Tom Browne presented a mass of unusual head coverings as part of their SS19 collection and blinding visitors to Fashion Week in Paris.
During the summer, extremely inefficient hats won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their snowscrapers to the podium.
The original Valentino: the main beige headdress, decorated with wide fields similar to feathers, was painted on the heads of models.
Other massive axesaurus included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even an pineapple, but all these head coverings were not intended to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of fancy masks, which had to be very much on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these sand masks were mouth-rolled, and they were more like Hannibal Lecturer's portrait than the turret painting.
One copy resembled underwater navigation equipment with pipe and protective glasses, and the other was a hidden ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're lucky.
The fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance to break into mass sales — right to you.
The hats of great size go on the heels of La Bomba, a straw hat with two-foot-wide fields that everyone has already worn, from Rianna to Emily Ratakovski.
The cultural label that released this highly impractical hat, which won so much popularity on social media, gave birth to and sent out a podium to walk through another huge asseoire — a straw beach bag, almost as big as the bather’s own model carrying the bag.
An orange bag made of a roasted Rafi with a white leather pen and a Rafi border is a vivid copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on Fashion Week in Paris.
Solebrateist Luke Armitage reports: “I think big hats and beach bags will appear in mass sales the next summer, and since the designer has produced such a furor with his works, it would be very difficult to ignore the demand for huge bills.”
John Edward: The knowledge of languages is of great importance to world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland continue their tradition of brilliant education, which was reaffirmed in 2018: outstanding examinations have demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other public subjects.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are enrolled throughout Scotland, and where they seek to provide the highest level of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen career, and the status of world citizens.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, then you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own tongue, you will turn to his heart.’
This is a convincing indication that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to have relations with and trust other citizens of other countries.
As a result of the latest examinations this year, we see that languages are at the top of the League tables and have the highest score on the exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who had learned foreign languages received the highest rating of A.
The data received for 74 SCIS-member schools showed that 72 per cent of pupils received A in Mandarin (or Chinese), while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent French students and 63 per cent Spanish students also received A.
This proves that in Scottish independent schools, foreign languages are clearly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects share the same demand as natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A 2014 survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission revealed that 17 per cent of the reasons for the difficulties faced by employers in filling vacant jobs were language skills.
Language skills are thus increasingly crucial to a successful future career for young people.
Given the fact that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession a student chooses, if he learns a second language, he will in the future gain a real advantage by learning another skill that he can use for the rest of his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives competitive advantages to a person who knows several foreign languages.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to support conversation, and French was the only two - digit language — spoken by 15 percent of the respondents.
That is why investing in language education is so important right now.
The knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, would give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland schools, there is a wide range of languages that are taught — each school has its own set of languages.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be most important to the British in the light of the future development of the country by 2020 — such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with a teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
Scotland's independent schools seek to create an educational environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of their future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital to the future development of the country in the global business environment, and this should therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages need to be seen as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, ensuring diversity and benefits for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director of the Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron debuts at Lakes on Sunday in San Diego.
The fan's keen expectation of LeBron James speaking for the first time at Los Angeles Lakes was almost over.
Lakeers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play a pre-zone Sunday match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But we've got to figure out how long it's gonna take.
“More than one and less than forty-eight”, replied Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lekers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-zone games on Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-zone games to prepare for the season”, the player replies.
Tramp election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of pre-election meetings this evening in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of Trump next week, including visiting friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his candidate for the post of Supreme Justice was postponed, Trump sought support in the forthcoming interim elections, since Republicans risk losing control of the Congress if the vote was to take place in November.
What time is Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wiling, West Virginia, will take place at 7 p.m. Eastern time today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's meeting with West Virginia voters online on a live YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to speak at this week's hearings to nominate his candidate, Bretta Cavanano, to serve as the Supreme Judge, and Trump's proposal has generated a mass of negative reactions, since Kavano was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote to be taken in the Senate will be postponed until a week's investigation is conducted by the FBI.
But the main objective of this action is to help Republicans entering the November elections to build up a pre-election pace.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign is aimed at enabling these five meetings, to be held next week, to “enhancing the activities of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, writes Reuters.
“The Congress is so important to its agenda that the President has to visit as many states as possible, because we are entering a tense election campaign season,” says Trump, a spokesman for the electoral campaign, who refused to be called Reuters.
The action planned today for Wesbanco Arena in Wilinga can attract supporters from "Ogayo and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
The visit of Tramp to West Virginia on this Saturday is the second visit to the state in the last month, where he gained the advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is behind the polls.
“The fact that, in order for Morris to begin to outpace the competitors in the polls, the president has to come is a bad sign for Morris himself, ” says Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia (quoted from Reuters).
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. Congregation shows willingness to fight and hopes to go out on Sunday for a couple of matches.
After three unilateral sessions, two-by-two Saturday games may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The transitional initiative is an exceptional, fabricated concept of sport, but it is believed by players, and it is particularly well expressed in such competitions.
So who's got the initiative?
“They had an advantage of six points, and now they have four, so I think this is a small initiative for us,” said Jordan Sleepy Departure.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and another twelve is on the line.
According to Spit, Americans feel the wind in the sails, and they have reason to keep their spirits high, not least because of the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and they can each boast three points out of four.
Sleeping was inviolable from you to the grind, as a personal example.
The winful shouts grew ever louder as his round continued, throwing the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas stepped two by two.
His blow, winning the 15th hole, was met with a similar cry, one of those who speak of his faith as a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together and focus only on our own game,” commented Spit.
That's all that's left for the players.
Walk 18 holes and be winners.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fltwood, who are undeniably part of the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe took four out of four, and they don't seem to know the mistakes.
Molewood was the only couple who did not acquire the god on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the god on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again Friday morning.
Such a series, and the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the wild fans, strengthens faith that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and that when the sun disappears beyond the horizon of the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous player who has established a potential victory for Europe than Flithwood or Molinari.
It would be nice if both were on different holes at the same time.
It is premature, however, to speak of the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly went after Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of a four-ball game when he was in partnership with Alex Noren.
The gods and two two gods on the first nine holes dug a Spanish and a Swedish hole from which they could never get out.
So no one will help you get out of your hole on Sunday.
It's so exciting to watch four-ball games and four-player games because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they exchange and who deliberately keep silent, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe has so far played better as a team, and it has advanced considerably on the last day, but this session of four has also shown that the United States has every effort to fight, which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day, Ryder Cup Europe leads with an account of 10-6
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup following the end of the Saturday matches of four balls and fours, with a priority of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet, Tommy Flithwood and Francesco Molinari, took the lead in fighting two battles over the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the Le Gold National score to four points.
Thomas Bjorn, a European team who wanted to recover the trophies lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the mistaken American team in the morning games of four balls, winning the 3-1 score.
The U.S. had more resistance in the Quartet, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow the bill gap.
Jim Ferik's team needs eight points out of 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophies safe.
Flithwood is the first European freshman to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname Mollywood after the sensational weekend, were only the second couple who won four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed into four balls, they were miraculously united to win the lost spirit of Woods and American newman Bryson Dechebmo with even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, last two Saturday's games, was showing periodic flashes, but now he's lost 19 out of 29 games in four, and the four are seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting in the morning before the four-ball game, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Thursday, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka with 2/1 in first and third place in the world.
For Europe, the game was not an easy and pleasant walk for a refreshing day to the south-west of Paris.
The two points earned by the three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday became a guide for the Americans.
They won a decisive victory with 2/1 over the Spaniards John Ram and Ayana Polter in four balls and returned later to play Polter and Rory Macylroy with 4/3 in the Quartet, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did the team get out of the four-point gap, leaving alone, given that the Feric team, as masters, had to play with a student to keep the trophies.
However, after two days of holding the second seat, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it were within their reach.
North Korea says that “categorically” will not be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions were increasing mistrust of the United States and that his country would never give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under any circumstances.
Ri Yong-ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial good faith measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the commitment not to increase the stockpiles of nuclear weapons or develop nuclear technology.
“However, we do not observe a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“There will be no confidence in the United States of America in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to take the first unilateral action on disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated the North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement seemed important in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Phenyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong-Yin and Donald Trump at the first historic summit between the United States President-in-Office and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to move towards “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is committed to the official end of the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States states that Pignian must first renounce his nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to calls for the weakening of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists that `denuclearization must begin' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal, and even objects to `a declaration of the end of the war',” says Ri.
“The notion that sanctions can put us on our knees is the utopian dream of people who do not know us.
But the real problem is that continuing sanctions add to our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second Kim-Trump Summit, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae In in the last five months and added: “If South Korea were a party to the issue of denuclearization, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in such a impasse”.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles on the United States mainland was inevitable after Mr. President of Evil Trump called Kim a “self-killing rocket”.
This year at the UN Trump, which threatened “to destroy completely” North Korea last year, commended Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday Trump said that he did not set any time limits for the process: “whether it takes two years, three years or five months, does not matter”.
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should encourage Pigniane for the steps that have been taken.
However, U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and necessarily until we see full, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to cut off the financing of Phenyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly's sidelines and reported after that meeting that he would visit Pignian again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Phenyang, saying that progress had been made, but within a few hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for “Bandith demands”.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States, for its part, took “appropriate measures” at a meeting with Moon this month.
He said that Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he had referred to were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest in special courses
This year's new course at Harvard University has helped all primary school students to learn to sleep more and to fight the Shovinist culture of continuous caffeine consumption in order to keep awake “night over”.
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Chasler, a sleep professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he considered to be the first of its kind in the United States.
After it was opened, he set off the idea of introducing such a course by giving a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came up to me and said, ‘I'm very sorry that I only learned about this now that I'm about to graduate.’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — what surprised me, ” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, describes how healthy sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting achievement and how it improves a person's overall self-esteem.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director at the University Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after it had been found that students were experiencing a serious sleep shortage during the school week.
The class lasts for one hour, the students perform a number of interactive assignments.
In one section of the class, we offer a picture of a dorm room where students, while pressing coffee cups, curtains, coaches, and books, receive information on how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, and sleep deprivation — affect sports results and the importance of daily sufficient sleep.
In another section, participants will learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
The interactive map of the campus encourages participants to reflect on their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change students’ behaviour at once.
But we believe they have the right to know, as any other person has the right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health,” added Professor Chasler.
According to him, false pride in the fact that a person can “bow all night” is still widespread, and modern technology, as well as increasing pressure on students, means that sleep deprivation becomes a problem.
He said that a sufficient amount of good-quality sleep was a student's secret weapon to deal with stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to combat excessive weight, as sleep deprivation transferred the brain to a state of hunger, causing him to experience a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond Soe, 19-year-old Californian, who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler develop a course by attending one of the classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to disseminate this information throughout the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all graduate students to attend a similar training programme before entering a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students install an alarm clock to warn them to sleep and wake up and to remember the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which disrupts human bioritism and leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Hol Menga brings victory over Gerard's team
The Rangers survived another sad retreat, as Goal Dolly Menga led Stephen Gerard's insular team to an attack at 1:0 in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team hoped to win its first victory after winning account 4:1 in February in St. John'ston, but Gary Holt's team only defeated Gerrard, out of 18 games as a manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving a light victory to the Harts team, leaders of the Scottish Prime League.
Menga was killed seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost their spirit, did not seem to be going to level the bill.
While Rangers was now at sixth place, Livingston rose to third place, giving way to Hibernian in relation to the ratio of bruised heads.
And Rangers may have additional problems after linear Judge Kalum Spence has had to heal a wound on his head after an item was dropped from the guest sector.
Jarard took eight replacements on the team that went through the Air in the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, for his part, followed the same strategy of Libya 11, which increased the gap with Harts last week, and he would be pleased to see his well-forced composition tightening the opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have been led by a sword, but Livingston was pushed far more when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to kill a goal in only two minutes when the first broadcast of Menga Scott Pittman stopped Allan McGreath, but the para-defense took advantage of the opportunity.
Kigan Jacobs struck Captain Craig Khalkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, was only able to send the ball towards the far side of the trouser.
Rangers had intercepted control, but the last third seemed to have more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he had to strike a fine of forty-fifth minutes when he and Stephen Lowles met, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers only hit two times in the first time, but the former Ibrox rabbler, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about the blow of Lassan Coulibaly's head and the faint blow of Ovi Ejaria.
Although the first goal of Livi, which was killed for the 34th minute, may not match the game, no one can deny that they deserve him exclusively with their own work.
But again, Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' game of standard position.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to transfer the ball to Menga for completion.
Jarard began to act on the break when he changed Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately produced the result when the extreme partisan gave the pass to Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran from his line into the interception.
But Liwingston continued to attract visitors to the game they intended to play with Litgou and Khalket, constantly making long broadcasts.
Holt's team was trying to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregore was able to block Jacobs before Litgow gave the transfer from the corner of the field.
Glenn Middleton, the Ranger's back-to-back player, once again demanded a penalty after he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanah: Inventor of Geiger counter
And now the page of our almanac entitled “Spring morning”: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Ghaiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
By becoming one of the basics of science, the Geiger counter has also become one of the basics of popular culture, and this is reflected in the film The Coronado Collola, with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — seemingly unlike scientists — in the main roles:
Man: "What kind of thing is this?"
Rogers: "This Geiger counter is used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can really hear the effects of atoms from the radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Here, I can hear it right now!"
The Ghans died in 1945 and did not live only a few days until its 63th birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new vaccine for cancer can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
A new missile vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the abnormally growing cells and kill them
Part of the vaccine's treatment is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions.
As a result of this cell change, the ability to “see” the type of protein characteristic of many types of cancer shall then be repeated to 0
The test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One of the patients who had received the vaccine and whose immune system had learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer had been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the patient's immune cells and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many types of cancer, and then reenter the changed cells.
Professor Jay Berzofski, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Bethlehem, Maryland, states, "The results we've obtained suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancers”, including breast, ovarian, lung and color cancer.
The same method was successfully used in leukemia treatment, which involved the removal of immune cells from patients and their “education” as to the effects on cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in MAGA's cap after his appearance in SNL.
It's gone badly.
Kanye West was a student at the studio during a Saturday concert where he spoke in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, claiming that he would resume his position in 2020.
Following the performance of his third song, entitled "The Ghost City," which he performed by putting on a cap called "Let's make America Great Again", the performer spoke against the democracies and supported Trump.
"Very often I talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," said the perpetrator.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Christine Blaisi Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
The television didn't show how the crowd resented West's statement, but this video was uploaded into social media by a comedian named Chris Year.
It is not clear now if Rock was trying this step to mock West.
In addition, West complained to the public that his cap had been ridiculed behind the scenes.
"They stood by me behind the stage.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They're really messing with me!
Washington Examer quotes him as saying, "And they also said that my position is not cool."
He continues: 'Do you want to know that it is not cool, and put on a superman's coat, that no one may tell you what to do, and do you want the world to continue to develop?
Then you need love."
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, the members of SNL appeared to be confused, and one person said to the publication, “The entire studio is in silence”.
West was invited at the last moment to replace Ariane Grande's singer whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller, had died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love It" in Perrier's bottle suit.
West received the support of the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the most courageous people: A SPAY FOR THE HELP OF MANY”.
The lead performer, Karen Hunter, wrote on Twitter that West was just "what he is, and it's absolutely amazing."
“However, I do not want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my view, shares and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
So did we,” she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “formally known as Kanje West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and walk in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Duddy, Puffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper of Snoop Doug, originally named Snoop Lyon, and another example of this, of course, is the author who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist, formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charges due to harassment at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds on Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballihakamor, as reported by the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Peace Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office will examine the charges.
Keith Harington's "Kingship Games" is attacking toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is known for his role as the sword- waving Jon Snow in the cruel medieval fantasy series of HBO "The Game of Thrones".
However, a 31-year-old actor recently criticized the stereotype of macho hero, saying that such characters often inspire young people to think that it is necessary to be cruel if you are to be respected.
In his interview, The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his colleague for the movie "The Game of the Thrones", said to Rose Leslie, his peers, that he was “very unequal” to the problem.
“I take this question very seriously: where did we get the wrong idea of courage?” the actor asks.
"Why do we teach teenagers that we have this problem today?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for this upsurge of toxic courage because of too muscular characters.
Akter continues: “What is born and what is acquired?
What are they taught on television and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they should show only one aspect of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because today's with young people, really, something's wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any quills or sikvels of the "King of the Thrones" after the show ended the following summer, saying that he had “done out of Battalies and horses”.
Since November, Keith will play a major role in the newly filmed True West by Sam Shephard, who tells of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
Acter recently announced that he believed that meeting Rose's wife was the best finale to him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and life,” says the actor.
Rose played Igrist, the subject of the passion of a character named Keith John Snow in a fantasy show awarded to Amy.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 in the backyard of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are suffering from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, indicating a change in past trends.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV infections has been reduced almost to zero by this means, as stated by Chinese health representatives at a conference in Yunnan province.
Annually, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a major problem in China ' s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is still widespread.
Studies confirm that 70-90 per cent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women because of the conservative values of the country.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection for these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies information about the diversion of information on the faults of senators of the Republican Party, complaining about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory”
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a U.S. parliament member, denied the charges that one of its staff had posted personal information to three U.S. senators on the page of the Wikipedia of Laws.
Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the claims were forged by “ultra-rights” experts and websites.
“False lies and even more lies,” says Waters on his Twitter.
It is reported that the information published includes the home address and telephone numbers of U.S. senators, Lindsay Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during hearings before the Senate Commission on sexual harassment charges against a candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Caváno.
The flight took place some time after three senators interviewed Kavano.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to Waters' office and made public information about Waters' staff, reports Hill.
“This unjustifiable claim is totally false,” says Waters.
“The members of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these frauds were in no way responsible for the diversion of this information.
This unjustifiable claim is totally false.”
The statement by Waters immediately called for criticism on the Internet, including by Ari Fleischer, former Press Secretary of the White House.
“This is an angry denial, ” writes Flasher.
“This means that the author has a temperament which is not suitable for Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be angry?
You don't have to make excuses either.
And you don't have to dig in the motives of the prosecutors either.
We must remain calm and cold.”
Fleisher seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the democracies against Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for the place of Waters in the interim election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If this is true, it is very important,” he writes.
In his statement, Waters writes that her office warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these frauds.
“We will ensure that criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which can be destructive and dangerous to all and all of my employees.”
Johnny Ingles hits again — weak parody on spy Rowan Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film that features Britain in one way or another; this is also the case with the new parody spy franchise, Agenta Johnny Inglis, which began production as early as 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film Agent Johnny Ingles: Reload.
Will it become a self-iconistic picture with the leitmotivism that “it's obvious that we're all shit” of a new attempt at national exports?
At any rate, Johnny Ingles’ beams with his rubber face gained his right to chaos for the second time — his name suggests that he is a wide - screen comical creation designed for a non-English film audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his amazing claims for a glamorous band, received some Clouseau, Mr. Bin's features, and a portion of this guy who introduced one single note to the Chariots of Fire tune in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
This character was originally created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the mysterious "international" Atkinson, who once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, where the hero leaves behind a total chaos.
This last issue of JE has one or two nice moments.
I really liked the scene where Johnny Inglys was approaching a medieval helicopter, and the blades were coming down his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift of physical performance of comedy scenes, but humor itself seems weak and strangely superfluous, especially since “serious” trials, such as “Agen 007” and “Mission Is Inaccessible”, are now confidently offering the comedy as an element.
It feels like humor is meant for children, not for adults, and for me, Johnny Inglech's elegance is not as resourceful and as appropriate as Atkinson's pranks in Mr. Bine's movies.
The permanent message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber-Hacker entered the top secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of a duty agent, Kevin Eldon, here unfortunately came an episodic role.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, a pompous and persistent figure who is already suffering from a huge political disenfranchisity: Emma Thompson is doing everything he can for the character Quazi-Teresa-May, but there's nothing to do with the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to withdraw someone from retirement.
Here comes Johnny Ingles, himself, who now works as a school teacher in a sweaty institution, but also gives informal lessons in secret operational work: there are some nice jokes, because Ingles offers the skills of a rock spy academy.
Ingles goes back to Whitehall for emergency training and reunites with his former unsettled friend, Baf, who is still being played by Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man who is under the command of the submarine commander, the role of the “joke hockey clubs” in which Vicki Pepperdin is lost a little.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game because her Majesty's secret service has made terrible mistakes, and they're facing a beautiful rock woman named Ophelia Bulletova in execution of Olga Curileenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously exposed to the charm of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems — the vicious Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
Ingles and Buff begin their porcelain odysse: disguised under waitresses, they set up a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves to Volta’s luxurious yacht; Ingles generate complete anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality suit to see Volta’s interior.
All these scenes, of course, are sweet and expensive, but there's something very childish about all of this.
It's a very modest thing.
And like Johnny Inglish, I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role that's really commensurate with his talent?
Laborists deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the British working week to four days for five days ' pay.
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corbina, is going to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but they will receive payment in five days.
The party reportedly wants company leaders to pay back savings from the artificial intelligence revolution to employees, giving them an additional day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy three days off for the same wage.
Sources reported that the idea “integrated” on the party's economic agenda and would help the population to take sides with the workers.
The Trade Union Congress approved the transition to a four-day working week so that workers could benefit from a changing economy.
A high-level source of the Labour Party said The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is our goal, which is consistent with the party's approach to changing the economy's balances in favour of workers, as well as with the party's overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this desire is currently not endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
The representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not party policy or is not being considered by the Party”.
The shadow chancellor John MacDonnell used a Labour Conference last week to specify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonnell said that he was determined to take power from “no one” directors and “cookers” of utility firms.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current water-share shareholders may not get their whole share back, as the Labour Government may make “disclosures” on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on the boards of directors of companies and to establish the Inclusive Observer Funds funds to transfer 10 per cent of private sector firms ' capital to workers who would be able to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell us "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Cavanaugh can change their opinion
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Bretta Cavanano delayed the final vote on his appointment to the post of Supreme Justice for at least a week and asked whether the Agency ' s findings could encourage any of the Republican senators to support Kavano.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelli, a 60-minute correspondent, interviewed Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, whether the FBI could find anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course, ” replied Kennedy.
“When I went to the meeting, I said I was talking to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and I heard this information, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His answer was decisive, definite and unambiguous.”
But Graham's opinion in the vote remained unswerving.
“I have made a firm determination about Brett Cavanano, and my view can only be altered by arguments that are only comparable to the dynamist,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett firmly denied it,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blacey Ford.
“No one she called as witnesses could confirm these facts either.
This story has been going on for 36 years.
And I saw nothing new in it.
What is Global Cities Festival and has he done anything to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday, in New York, there will be a Global City Festival of World Citizens, an annual musical event in which an impressive starry body with an equally impressive mission will take part — an end to poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year, as part of the Festival of World Citizens, tens of thousands of people have flocked to the large park of the Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendez, but also to share the real purpose of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens ' Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the global project to combat poverty carried out by the international group of human rights defenders, which hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), you had to participate in volunteer activities or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a phone call or carry out any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the World Citizens' Festival in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of paying people to go to concerts really convince fellow citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “callivism”, where people believe that they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers claim that since 2011, more than 19 million “activities” by its supporters have been registered at the festival, with many different objectives.
It is recalled that, as a result of these actions, world leaders have pledged more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group issued 390 commitments and announcements made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimated that the funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is the Power of Nation: the British Partnership of Investors and Implementation Specialists committed to “help children to reach their full potential”, promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the district, which was done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Cities.
“With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national Governments and Global Cities, such as you, we can make social injustices about the lack of nutrition of past history,” said Ambassador Power of National Tracy Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Nutrition Power Project, which would reach 5 million women and children through activities designed to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the often asked questions on the festival website, why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
The organizers of the Global Citizen answer: “This will be a long and difficult road, on which we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But as in the great movements for civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Janel Mone are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, leading by Debarra Lee Fernness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy to block Russian energy exports: Minister of the Interior
The U.S. Minister of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, stated that Washington could “if necessary” use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia ' s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, is able to ensure the openness of maritime routes and, if necessary, the blockade so that their energy does not enter the market,” said the Minister.
Zinke addressed the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that stands for itself as “the voice of the energy user” in the United States.
He then compares Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less effective use and substitution of fuel”, said the Minister, calling Russia a “one-trick pony”, whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration had set the goal of increasing exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, which offered a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump of the United States itself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Northern Flow 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin “a plenary” of Moscow.
In Moscow, it has been repeatedly stressed that the Northern Flow 2 project, worth $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce resistance to the project is based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers”, said the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Nowak, after meeting with the US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists, through the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State intervenes in our energy supply, it poses a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of the German Industry (BDI) following the recent meeting of the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Senator, Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, will study carefully the possibilities of running for the presidency in 2020.
The Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, announced on Saturday that he would carefully explore the possibility of running for the presidency after an interim election.
In a meeting of the City Duma in Holioca, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the pre-election race.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and it takes a woman upstairs,” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will give careful consideration to the possibility of running for Presidents.”
Warren expressed this appreciation for President Donald Trump's work during the meeting: “This district will lead in the wrong direction”.
“I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy to the brain,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump and his candidate for the post of Supreme Judge Brett Cavanaugh.
In his Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before voting.”
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most voters do not think Warren himself should run in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Centre for Political Studies of the University of Saffolk/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the “probable” Massachusetts voters stated that the senator should not run.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the other hand, supported its plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed him.
Other well-known names of democracies that were discussed in connection with the 2020 vision include former Vice-President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden claims that he will take an official decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin spoke of the post-traumatic stress disorder Track Paylin at a meeting with the voters of Donald Trump
Trek Paylin, 26, joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same experiences as those of other families who suffered the consequences of PTSD and were injured, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Paylin called his arrest “a white eye” and said of her son and other veterans of the war: “They are returning already to others, slaughtered, wondering whether the same respect is shown to their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military force they have given to their country.”
Trak Paylin was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, meddling in the situation of alcohol-intoxicated violence and possession of weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a member of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District Colombia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, which prohibits the provision of shelter to victims of flight or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts filed an analytical note in Washington on Friday by a court consultant on support for a policy challenge asylum seeker.
The complainant's full name in the case “Grace v. Sessions”, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy, is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband, “and his sons who are members of a criminal group”, subjected her to ill-treatment, but on 20 July U.S. officials rejected her asylum request.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace said that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala were applying for asylum in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy set aside a decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum without documentation from domestic violence.
The Attorney-General of the District of Colombia, Karl Rusin, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “has ignored decades of State, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be considered on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle,” says a judicial adviser.
Lawyers also argue that policies prohibiting immigrants are detrimental to the US economy, emphasizing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “ensure the necessary labour”.
In June, the Attorney-General, Jeff Sashns, ordered immigration judges no longer to provide shelter to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“The asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion”, said Sashns in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to save lives in Palau: The number of deaths doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more difficult.
“It is now very difficult, ” says a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick child at the evacuation centre of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances bring in the wounded.
Clean water is in large deficits.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig through wet things, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including the Haris engine, which had a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting near the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated in the open air because they were forced to leave the room because of continuing strong pushes.
He weeps as he recalls the severe earthquake that destroyed his hotel room on the fifth floor, which he filmed with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I'm stuck in the wreckage of the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming, asking for help, and then silence came.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they're saved and they're all right now.”
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “attacks” carried out through “advertising”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. and Chinese trade, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to promote propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to a fee supplement to the Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of attempting to intervene in the 6 November U.S. Congress elections.
The charge that Trump is trying to intervene in U.S. elections is evidence of the fact that U.S. officials reported to Reuters: there is a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While foreign Governments are the norm for advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalation of the trade war, resulting in their balancing of tariffs on imports of their countries.
China's response tariffs at the beginning of the commercial war were intended to impress exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republic's Trump Party, with Chinese and American experts.
Terry Brunstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term Governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, claims that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China writes Branstad in an article published in the Sunday’s Das Moines Register, “now doubles this herbalization by publishing propaganda in our own free press. ”
“In exacerbating its propaganda, the Chinese Government has enjoyed the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by paying and publishing advertising in the Des Moines Register,” writes Brunstad.
“However, in the newspapers here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices and to see the true diversity of views that the Chinese can learn from China’s alarming economic policy, since the local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of China's most famous newspapers had “stupidly deleted” from the invitation to publish its article, although it did not give an exact title.
Analysts warn that Kavano's carryover is being pushed away by Republican women voters the day before the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stand aside and defend Supreme Judge Bretta Cavanaugh despite several allegations of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially by women, which may affect the upcoming interim elections.
Emotions around this situation have broken to the extremes, and most Republicans have formally stated that they want to continue voting.
It is impossible to return to such things later, ” writes Grant Rier, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in his Saturday article.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Abortiona) attempt to investigate the FBI at the last minute will suffice to calm the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Representative of MoveOn Progressive Group, Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors scandaled “Nov! ahead of the Senate”, when the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to nominate Cavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, reports Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the bounds, ” stated political politician Stu Rotenberg on the news site.
“People say that the situation has already been bad enough, and that's true.
But things can get worse, especially for women voters in suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the President, often don't vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the post of Supreme Justice, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts had suggested that if the Republicans confirmed the move, that could trigger a reaction.
“This is already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee early last week, as reported by NBC News.
“It is not only a matter of voting in a committee or a final vote or whether Cavanao has sat on the bench of defendants, but also of how the Republicans deal with it as they relate to it,” says Guy Ceceil, director of the United States of America, a group that helps to elect democracies, a news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the question of whom to believe — Ford or Cavanaugh — and slightly more inclined toward the latter.
A new survey of YouoGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe exactly or likely in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they believe Cavanaugh accurately or most likely.
In addition, 38 per cent believed that Cavanano was likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
Flake is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramírez, reports The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath to the Senate's Legal Committee that Cavanaugh, when intoxicated, attacked her when she was 17.
Ramírez claims that the candidate for the post of Supreme Justice showed her his genitalia at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, runs a startup that competes with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee Solid open platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to access.
In an exclusive interview, Last Company Berners-Li joked that the objective of Inrupt was to obtain “world domination”.
“We must do it now,” he says of his startup.
“This is a historic moment”.
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own online data warehouses or PODs.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Space -- everything can be used in the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data repository is that it is entirely managed by the user, who can access all necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data”.
According to John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
At present, the company is composed of Berners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several full-time developers contracted for the project and a volunteer community.
From this week on, technology developers around the world will be able to develop their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether his companies should make radical changes that would bring about complete change in all their business models overnight.
“We do not ask them for permission.”
Berners-Li wrote in his post on the Media on Saturday that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid network”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Li's voice has been quite influential in the debate over network neutrality in recent months.
Even by launching Inrupt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next Internet age,” says Berners-Li.
Bernard Vanne: Church minister awarded Victoria’s cross during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one warrior priest was awarded Victoria's cross during World War I, and this event was observed in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vanne was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his involvement in the attack on Bellenglis and Loucour.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later without ever learning that he had received the highest British military award.
The memorial to commemorate the event was inaugurated by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vanne, said that it was “very symbolic”, that the monument had been opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received his reward.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vanne conducted his battalion through the St. Canton Canal “in very thick fog and under the heavy fire of field weapons and machine guns”.
He later entered the line of fire and led the group “with the greatest courage” and then, with one hand, threw a gun into the field and shot down three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanne was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
A 72-year-old grandson, Michael Vanne, said that “he would hardly have been able to do the same heroicly, but it's dying.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vanne also put in a vein after the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honour for him to participate in the parade” and added that “the prowess of a real hero is confirmed by the support that will be given by many people”.
IMA worshipers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they were shown a Peppu lead
Imagine you haven't slept all night to see the complete Bellator 206, but you haven't been allowed to see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 fightings, including six major fighting programmes, which were broadcast all night live on 5 British television channels.
At 6: 00 a.m., while Hegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, the fans of the United Kingdom were shocked to see “Pepp's Lead” screens.
Some fans were not impressed because they had not slept until the morning just to watch the fights.
One Twitter fan called this change in the children's cartoon "some sort of sick joke."
“It was decided by the State that for 6 a.m. the content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication when asked why this had happened.
"Yes, "Pepp's Lead."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said that they were planning to plan a schedule so that future battles could also be seen by British viewers.
“As for re-showing, I think we can resolve this issue,” says Coker.
“But there's Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we can't resolve this until Sunday, and for them it's Monday.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a bunch of text messages appeared, and all of them were far from friendly.
We were just trying to solve this problem right away, thinking it was some kind of technical failure.
Turns out no, it was a matter of public importance.
I promise I won't do that next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase that number, but we're getting over it.
Yes, it didn't work."
Desert Islanddiscs: Tom Daley felt inadequate because of his sexual orientation
The Olympian diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete told me he didn't realize that "not everyone like him" was until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Islanddiscs program, led by Laurent Laverne, he said that he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope”.
He also said that the victory in the Olympics had become less concerned with him since he had a child.
The permanent head of Kirsty Young's multi-year show took several months' leave because of the illness.
Daily, who served as the main guest in Laverne's programme, said that he felt “more worthless than any other peer” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, for both boys and girls.
He says: “So far, these feelings of worthlessness and incompetence have been real, but they have given me strength, and I have been successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something" so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
A two-fold bronze Olympic medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and, in his presentation at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he was able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others hope.
A three-time world champion said that the feelings for a man, American director Dustin Lanse Black, whom he met in 2013, had “suddenly caught him”.
In the past year, Daley married Oscar's laureate, who is 20 years older than him, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“If so many things happen in your life at such a young age”, he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find a peer who has the same dramatic life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Dailey, and Daly said that "all his world perception" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win a gold medal," says the athlete.
"But you know what, there are things and important gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not want to tolerate his dying, and one of his last requests was to make first-row tickets at London 2012.
"I couldn't tell him, "Pope, you're not gonna be around then, and you can't sit in the front row," says Daley.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he was not unconquerable, ” says the athlete.
Next year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had hoped for all my life — to dive before a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes him so much.
Desert Islanddiscs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 English Summer Time.
Michaelson, not in uniform, spent this Saturday's Ryder Cup on the bench.
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup, but he'll have to pull his uniform out to avoid a bad milestone.
Mickelson, who played the binnal for the last 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Fürick to the bench on Saturday for four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as has often been the case in the United States, a five-time major winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of correcting his concerns.
Never with the most direct impact, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete is not the ideal candidate for the strict Le Golf National, where a long Raf is usually punished for inaccurate blows.
And if the course is not sufficiently frightening by itself, Michaelson will meet on Sunday in the ninth match with an accurate British Open Francesco Molinari champion who joined up with a new guy, Tommy Fleetwood, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12th solitary match make a bright start, Michaelson's match may be decisive.
Ferik expressed confidence in his partner, though what else he could say.
“He fully understood the role assigned to him today, patted me on my back, hugged me, and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Ferik commented.
“He's pretty sure of himself.
He's a walking Hall of Glory, and he's done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I was hoping for more, but that was the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On Sunday, Michaelson will beat Nick Foldo's record of the number of games in Ryder's Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which never met the heights of his individual record.
Miquelson has 18 wins, 20 injuries, and seven others, although Ferik said that his presence had greatly benefited the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he likes teaching people, and he's a great guy with whom he's interested," he explained.
"I think this week the young players had fun with him, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than a game."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, has learned from experience that considerable leadership in solitary confinement in the Ryder Cup can easily turn against itself.
The Dutch debuted at a match in 1997 in Valderram, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but had overcome the finish line only a little further forward with the least difference, winning at 141⁄2-1312.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but just before,” said Bjorn, who had been photographed after seeing the 2018 class, winning in the Le Gold National field at 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday, which resulted in 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the entire team that this is not over.
Tomorrow, you'll be on top of it.
Go and do the right thing.
As long as we don't have glasses on the sign, it's not over yet.
We have a goal, and that's the chance to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I have spoken silently, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we already know so well that what we stand against is against the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with the way his players performed on their uncomfortable golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have surpassed myself in this.
There's a different test for us tomorrow.
The individual presentations begin tomorrow, and this is another matter.
It's always nice to be with your partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, you're having all the power of a professional golfist.
It is this idea that the players need to be inspired so that they can come up with the full tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he must make every effort, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferik, believes that his players will be better off individually than their partners, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Férique himself has gone through this entire field of recent days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he finally loses when Europe held the "Mindo Miracle".
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, bringing his players together before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to finish it more quickly, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the game.
We set up our plan for the game and set up the boys as we thought they were right, you know, tomorrow we're going to try to create a miracle.”
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the resistance by meeting Rory Macylroy at the top mat with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ayana Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I chose this kind of group of guys, and in this order, because I think they're going to close all the possible flaws,” said Bjorn, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The new German warship was again postponed
The newest German fleet frigate was to be operationalized in 2014 in order to replace the ageing cold war war war ships, but this will not happen at least next year due to faulty systems and a grueling rise in value, reports the local media.
The entry into service of the Rhineland-Palitza, the main ship of the completely new Baden-Württemberg Frigates, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit with reference to the military representative.
The vessel was to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery made the fate of the ambitious project more difficult.
The four Baden-Würtemberg vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the ageing Bremen class frigates.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful gun, multiple anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some of the technologies “steels” — such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods — the possibility of deployment of the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
Nevertheless, the constant postponement of entry into service means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread their power abroad, will become obsolete by the time they come into service, notes Die Zeit.
The F-125 frigate was reported in news headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to enter the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipmaster after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects” that made the warship useless when used in combat.
The software shortfalls were particularly critical, as vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class would be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors — only half of the labour force on old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy, reducing its productivity and limiting the capacity of the Navy to implement future updates.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatitz is twice as heavy as the ships of the same class that were used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering Euro3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared with the initial Euro2.2 billion.
The problems of keeping the newest frigates anchored are particularly important in the light of recent warnings to reduce Germany ' s naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the naval force had actually “endowed the supply of vessels capable of deployment”.
The officer said that the problem had become worse over time because the old ships had been removed from service but had not been replaced by ships.
He visited that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates could be armed by a fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted in one of the highlands of Scotland is designed to show how bats use the landscape to find food.
It is hoped that the data will provide a fresh look at the behaviour of unique winged mammals and will help in further conservation of the species.
A study organized by scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will examine common netopes, soprano netopes, as well as brown long-rottle flying mice and Dobanton Nights, which inhabit the Investigated Gardens, Vester Ross.
Special recordrs will be installed at some locations around the site to monitor the activities of bats throughout the entire season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile field surveys using hand detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the cries as well as the activities for which the various groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the habitat will then be drawn up and a report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their landscape-based behaviour.
Rob Dewar, an NTS conservation adviser, hopes that these results will show what habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of habitat management, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways of maintaining forest ranges, which are optimal for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and all over the United Kingdom have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are threatened by extinction due to construction and de-delloper, which affect their habitat and habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting facilities can also pose a danger, as well as a sticker for flies, chemical treatment of building materials and hunting of domestic cats.
In fact, flying mice are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to mining.
They use sophisticated echo-location equipment to accurately identify the obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
The organization has 10 trained experts who conduct regular interviews, field checks and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even established the first and only fly mice reserve in Scotland in the town of Treave in Damfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of Scottish bats live.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says that the name is the ideal place for them.
"Here, in Threave, excellent place for bats," he said.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of a good environment.
But much remains unknown about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need for a secure existence.”
He recalled the importance of checking the presence of bats before performing maintenance within the private domain, since the unintentional destruction of one nest could result in the death of up to 400 females and young persons and possibly even the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by law and their destruction, digestion or destruction is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrella, a Scottish bat conservation fund officer, calls for public assistance.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many of their separate species live."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to sue on a German magazine
Krishtian Ronaldo denies the charges of rape against him, calling them “fee news” and claiming that people simply “want to propagation” using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue on the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published charges against the football player.
Forvard Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayor, who allegedly took place in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, reporting on Friday "Spigel".
Speaking on an Instagram video of 142 million subscribers, some hours after the charges were reported, in which 33-year-old Ronald referred to this information as “fixed news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all the fair news, says the five-time winner of Ballon d'Or on camera.
"They just want to get impregnated using my name.
It's okay.
They want to become famous by saying my name, but it's just part of their work.
I’m a happy person, and I’m fine, ” the athlete adds with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file charges against Der Spiegel, which they call “unacceptable information on suspicions of confidentiality”, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Shertz stated that the player intends to seek compensation for “moral damage in a manner commensurate with the gravity of a legal violation which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It is alleged that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
When he met at a nightclub, Ronald and Majorg allegedly returned to the player's room where he allegedly raped her in an anal form, according to documents submitted to the Clarke District Court in Nevada.
Major claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on her knees and told her that he was “99 per cent good, but he lied by one per cent”.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple were having sex, but this was by mutual consent.
Major also claims that she turned to the police and that her injuries were taken at the hospital but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and feared "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her place of residence because she continued to experience the traumatic feelings resulting from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid of Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juvee in a deal of Euro100 million.
Brexit: Great Britain “supposes auto-producers lost forever”
The Minister for Business and Enterprise Affairs, Greg Clarke, stated that Britain “will wish it forever” if, after Brexit, it loses its status as world leader in car production.
He also commented that Toyota UK had informed BBC that if Britain got out of the EU without a transaction, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal”, said Mr. Clarke.
A Japanese car manufacturer stated that the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could result in job losses.
The Bernaston factory produces Toyota Auris and Avenue, and last year it released almost 150,000 vehicles, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain withdraws from the EU by the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped,” says Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Great Britain expressed concerns about the exit from the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford within one month after Brexit.
The main concern is that, according to manufacturers, if there is no Brexit transaction, the supply chain will be placed at high risk.
The Toyota production line is launched “at an exact time” and details for ordered vehicles are supplied by British and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Great Britain withdraws from the EU without a transaction on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border, which, according to industry representatives, could lead to delays and lack of spare parts.
According to Toyota, Toyota will not be able to store stocks at his factory in Derbyshire for longer than one day, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that Theresa May's Plan, made at Chekers, for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks”.
“We need a deal, we want to conclude a better agreement that will allow us, again, not only to succeed now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he reported on the BBC Radio 4 program today.
“Not only Toyota, but other producers argue that we must be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to specify the time frame for the production to be stopped, but warned in the longer term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually reduce jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and who is the manager of the factory's trade union, says that the concern of the organization's members is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will not be able to get them back.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU”.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, according to White House information.
The responsible meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein could be “removed for another week”, as the struggle for Bretta Cavanaugh's appointment to the post of Supreme Justice is ongoing, and the White House was announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein manages the work of Special Adviser Robert Müller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between the Assistants Trump and Russia, and potential obstacles to the President ' s justice.
Whether Trump would be dismissed from office by the Deputy Attorney-General, thereby endangering the independence of Müller, throughout Washington, D.C., has caused a mass of speculation for many months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of wires to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of presidential impeachment by means of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, allegedly to resign.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would have preferred not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's judicial committee, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaisy Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the complaints of the FBI in Kavano, further delaying the full vote in the Senate.
The Spokesperson for Trump, Sarah Sanders, addressed Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been scheduled, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court”.
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists contest this claim: Sanders has not briefed the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to the “hate of the community” of television reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they are playing at the public.”
She suggested an increase in direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President meets more in response to the questions of journalists than any other President before him”, she added, without, however, providing precise figures: “We have these figures”.
Sanders said that briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me”.
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had over the past few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, this is a worthy replacement for the press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, attending open meetings or press conferences with high-level officials.
Conferences are rare for the press alone.
The frivolary, and sometimes strange, behavior of the president to journalists gathered this week in New York may be the answer to why this is so.
The Minister of Health addressed a letter to EU workers in Scotland regarding concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has approached EU staff working in Scottish GCS to express their gratitude on behalf of the whole country and to wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Gene Freeman,MSP, addressed this letter to staff members less than six months before British departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the cost of processing status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “The British-EU withdrawal negotiations continued during the summer, and the expected solution must be delivered in the autumn.
However, the British Government is also strengthening preparations for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
It is therefore now that I want to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleges from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we very much want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie suffered an emergency head injury operation
Michael Organ, from Tennessee, reported that Christian Abercrombie's semi-protector, Tennessee State Tigers, had undergone an emergency operation after his head was injured on Saturday, 31-27, in a match with Vanderbilt Commodores.
The chief coach of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told journalists that the injury had been sustained shortly before the break.
“He went up to the side line and just collapsed there,” said Reid.
Coachs and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing it on the porter and taking it to medical examinations.
Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operating at the Vanderbilt health centre.
Harris added that “there are no details about the type/stamp of the injury” and Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, only a second year, it was the first season of Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which was 18 balls per season.

According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers would be charged with a higher salary fee when purchasing real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional funds recovered would be used to help the homeless.
This step will reverse Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
High-arm fees will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year in favour of the homeless
Foreign buyers will be required to pay a higher salary fee for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and the extra money recovered will be used to help the homeless — this being announced today by Theresa May.
This step will reverse the results of Corbin's attempts to attract young voters who promise to make housing more accessible and to raise citizens' incomes.
The increase in the salary fee would be charged to individuals and firms that did not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus obtained should stimulate the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
A supplement to the existing cash collection, including an increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary and rental housing, may amount to up to 3 per cent.
Treasury expects this step to pay up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London real estates are purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, resulting in higher prices and making it difficult for buyers buying their first dwelling to improve their housing conditions later.
Many of the country's elite areas, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the large number of foreign buyers who, having bought housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
A new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the collection of the pistol to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of blowing up real estate prices by acquiring land but not actually using it, and called on Ms. May to give up the quota on affordable housing in order to correct the "dignity of housing" situation in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include the control of rents and the cessation of unjustifiable evictions.
He also wished to give the local authorities more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May stated: “I said last year that I had dedicated my Prime Minister to the fulfilment of the British dream — that life would be better with every new generation.
That includes solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and live here.
However, it is not fair that for non-United Kingdom citizens as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as accessible as it is for hard-working British.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring their own home has become too distant, and the threat to some is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run Scotland."
The Sundwin Club boss Jack Ross says that his "end goal" is to become a Scottish manager at some point.
A 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys reviving the North-East Club, which currently ranks third in the first league, separating three points from the first.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Prime League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a cap of B, and everything," said Ross Sport Around BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching my father in Scotland as a child in Hamden, and it always attracted me back.
However, this will only be possible if I can be a successful club manager.”
The predecessors of Ross, the managers of Sundul, were also Dick Advokaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardais, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Poyette and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloy Athletic said he was not trembling at such authoritative names in such big clubs, having previously turned down the Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals.
“To me, success for the moment will depend on whether I can return this club to the Prime League.
In its structure and capabilities, the club clearly belongs to the Prime League,” says the coach.
“To get him out there is not an easy task, but I'm going to think I've done my job only if I can get the club back.”
Ross only serves for three years as manager, first as assistant manager at Dumbarton, and then spent 15 months at the Hatts Coach.
Then he helped Alloy get up from third level and next season brought St. Mirren out of his lower position to win the championship.
Ross claims he's more comfortable today than he's ever had during his game career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Acadelic.
“It must have been a real intersection,” he recalls his responsible work in Alloy.
“I sincerely believed that management was more suitable for me than a game.
That sounds strange because I did everything well, earned a good job and made progress.
But playing is more complicated.
There are a lot of things you have to do every week.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good about being a manager.
I've always wanted to lead, and now that I've done this, I feel most comfortable as a fish in water throughout my adult life."
You can listen to a full interview on the Sport Around on Sunday, 30 September, on Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 a.m., English Summer Time.
According to the survey, 5:30 p.m. is the ideal time for a beer pint.
Summer heat has increased the sales of British pubs, but it has reduced sales in restaurants.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July and fell by 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting company CGA, who obtained this statistics, says: “Stressing solar activity, as well as longer than expected, England's participation in the world championship means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when the sales in the pubs grew by 2.8 per cent and, on the contrary, in restaurants, significantly reduced.”
The June decline in restaurant revenue by 1.8 per cent also continued in July.
The pubs and bars selling alcohol have shown much higher results in restaurants.
Peas selling only food were also affected by the sun’s heat, although not as much as restaurants.
It feels like people want to jump out just to miss a glass.
The sales of beverages in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month and the food grew by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in recreation and hotel business, says: “These results continue to follow the trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain critical when it comes to sales on the non-living market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to experience difficulties, especially since the decline of 4.8 per cent in annual sales will be particularly painful due to continuing price pressures.
The long summer has proved to be more than ever before for food operators, and it has not yet been the fact that August, with more moderate temperatures, will give much-needed relief.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowing of brands.
The monitoring of industry sales by Coffer Pach Tracker for the British sector of pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses data on the productivity of 47 networks with aggregate traffic of more than £9 billion and is a recognized industry reference.
1 out of every 5 children has secret accounts in social media that they hide from their parents
According to the survey, 1 out of every 5 children — some as young as 11 years of age — have secret accounts in social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the page of the “fixing insta”
This news raised concerns about sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "core" account that parents know about
However, 1 out of every 5 children — some as young as 11 years of age — creates accounts in social media that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fair accounts of “instaste” — i.e., an instagram, a website for the exchange of photographs.
This news raised concerns about content publications of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of the students stated that they had a basic, “clean” account that their parents had access to, but also secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally obtained access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, came across a teenager who called on others to “rape him”.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two social media profiles, half of whom admitted that one of them was usually secret.
Chapter HMC, Mike Buchanan, says, "Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not accessible to their parents and teachers, and this is a disturbing fact."
Alyde Doyle will become the voice of Scottish light athletes
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elyd Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Light Athletics as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most titled light athlete, and President Ian Beatty claims that this is an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from the extensive experience of an international athlete in the past decade.
“Alyde enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community, and we are confident that her participation will bring great benefits to the light athletics of Scotland,” Beatty claims.
Doyle says, "I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really make a good contribution and promote sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters on the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and is now working as a private commentator on BBC, after a stroke.
He writes on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I would recover, and if so, to what extent.
It was a exhausting job, but I am fully cured, I have learned to walk, and I am doing fishing exercises today!
Thank you so much for your support."
Feeding mothers were compared to cows by an ad that shared the views of Internet users
The milk - producing company has caused an Internet dispute by publishing an ad in which nursing mothers are compared to fat cows.
By putting on the market, it is said, “the world's first silent breast-to-breed milk,”, Elvie's consumer technology company published an advertising music video that demonstrates the freedom that the new milk-to-meat provides to nursing mothers.
The four real moms dance in the complete hay cow's shop under the music track, where they say, "Yes, I feed my own milk, but you don't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed it, it's my breast."
And then the chorus says, "We follow, we follow, we feed our babies with breast milk, we follow, we follow."
This commercial, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video received a mixed response from the viewers, many saying that it sheds light on the milk industry's “pestilences”.
“It is a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except for their children to be taken away from them within days of birth, ” writes one user.
Alvie milk is put directly under the special bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is understood that this is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk-tosses for mothers who leave their children behind?"
Another user adds: “Advertisements cut off from reality”.
Others, on the contrary, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was “very great”.
“I think it's a great idea.
If I fed the baby, I'd have bought one.
Your breast-feeding really made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a little crazy, but that's how it feels.
A brilliant product," wrote one user.
And another comment: "A fancy ad designed for mothers who breast-feed (often they do it right at their workplaces or toilets) and who actually feel a little "cows."
This ad is not intended to praise or praise our milk industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they're all dancing with these invisible milk-trees hidden under their bras.
The concept of this advertising campaign is precisely based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie milk is totally insolvent, without wires or tubes, freely placed in a breast-feeding room, and unmet, allowing women to move, keep small children, and even go outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood specialist at Mother, comments: “Milmosos Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative promotion.
In a parallel between women and dead cows, we wanted to focus attention on breastfeeding and all its problems, while demonstrating in a joking and cheerful way the incredible sense of freedom that a new milk sucks.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk is in the news headlines.
During London’s fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Martha Jakubowski using this product as intended.
Hundreds of migrant children moved without hindrance to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that made it difficult to accommodate children.
The majority of sponsors themselves are usually the same undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by taking over the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to be held under the authority of the remaining minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“About 80 per cent of persons who are either sponsors or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these individuals,” said Albens.
According to the shelter staff, in an effort to speed up the process of child development, officials introduced new rules that required some of them to be tried within a month of detention, rather than 60 days later.
In order to declare their legal status to the immigration judge, many are present by video, not by personal contact.
Those who are deemed not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to the shelter workers and the information available in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of child difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without allowing them time emotionally to prepare or say good-bye to their friends can add to the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the United States of America, France and Turkey to withdraw troops immediately
In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that war had been raging in the country for eight years.
Mualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions,” he said to the congregation.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to lead this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return and accused “some Western countries” of“ spreading irrational fears” that had caused refugees to remain outside the country.
“We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he said.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue”.
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to rebuild until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major seal of the Idlib rebels provided an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including Al-Qaida-related fighters of the Nusra Front, who would “be destroyed”.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the Government and the opposition, will be convened soon to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, stating that the Commission's work should be limited to “consideration of the articles of the current Constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if the impeachment and the scandal do not prematurely complete his presidency, which is probably the hope of many liberal spectators.
And that will no doubt be the most dramatic finale of the presidency in all history!
At present, there is no sign of the fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled, to 1.05 million per CNN and to almost threefold, to 1.6 million per MSNC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNC's "The Rachel Maddown Show" peaked the ratings of cable channels by collecting 3.5 million evening viewers during the main news show.
“This is a fire that people are reaching because it's beyond our understanding,” says Neil Behr, director of the ABC drama, “Adestined survivor”, about a cabinet member who becomes president after Capitol has been destroyed by the attack.
Nell Scowell, a long-published comedy writer and author, “Just funny: a few unpleasant truths about the infiltration of the Hollywood Boys Club”, offers another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi once in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, “Because he's funny!”, Ms. Scowell says.
In all this chaos, something precious is fun.
Of course, unlike all the rest of the content broadcast on television, Washington’s stories can determine the future of Row vs. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, when you've been watching for six hours, a group of experts is discussing Bob Woodworth's use of a "deep background" for his book Fear, or Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 of ostriches (heighty clothing," as Washington Post writes), or the cutting description of Stormy Daniels, say so, Mr. Trump's anatomy, is already beyond ordinary awareness.
I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes, for instance.
“Part of his work is to make us feel that the reality show is that he feeds you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Weelhousecard and the creator of the "Pawn Stars" about the changing actor composition of the Trump show and the daily turns of the story.
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleys this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the north bank of Kauai, and the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNC during CNN's recording.
He could not withdraw from the screen, at least not when he showed exactly how Brett Cavanaugh appeared before the Senate Legal Committee and decided on the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” he said.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Outsider money enters the toughest interim elections ever held by the White House.
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives cash flows through the change of districts in Congress, where two officials are in the race for the same place.
This suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose geography was recently changed, supports a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who was given a seat in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
The Lamb opposes another active official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which closely overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that, as a result of pre-election fraud, the old areas were attributed to Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a heated debate on the financing of campaigns between the financial forces of the main party, the Congress Committee of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lamba became known in Pennsylvania after winning a small difference in the March-wide special elections to Congress in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by the Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district with 20 points of preference.
Political experts give the democracies a small advantage.
The United States had ordered El Salvador for its support of China but had then retreated.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had caused a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and was also in his possession in Panama until his partners evicted Trump ' s management team.
The representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions on non-acceptance of Taiwan”, a statement was made earlier this month by the Spokesperson of the Department of Heyzer Nauert.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received about $140 million of American assistance in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for that Central American country, with its high unemployment and murder rates.
Against the background of regular internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to take stock of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, high-level officials had made it clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to move forward and had actually ceased consideration of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled to take place in mid-October, and Vice-President Mike Pens will address it as an indication that the Administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
The three United States diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without carrying any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports also confirm an outside analyst who is part of the administration, but also speak in an anonymous manner.
Learn History
The next step may be to report by Special Adviser Robert Müller on possible interference with Mr. Trump ' s justice, which is currently well documented in public records.
Mr. Müller was also reportedly investigating the plot of Trump's campaign with Russia and its attacks during the past elections.
If Congress replaces the owner, Mr. Trump will face the responsibility of this body, just as he is prepared to speak again to the voters, and perhaps eventually to the jury from among his colleagues.
But there is a lot of "if"; I don't mean to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to set up a coup d ' état and overthrow Hitler, which would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we did not do so, thus missing the opportunity to avoid further years of bloodshed.
The course of history is based on these points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are experiencing some of these turning points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisss Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Müller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, he offered to make secret records of the President ' s activities last year and discussed his inadmissibility for office.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times are incorrect.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation of Bretta Cavanano is not complete or true, or if he is still confirmed as a Supreme Justice despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
Above all, will we vote in the medium term in favour of the Congress, which will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these trials with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to get through them with dignity because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied an ambassador's house, where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later led me to light Saturday candles on a table with a swastika symbol.
With a family past like me, can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the pre-eminence of the VEN Rapid football club.
The Rangers accept the Vienna “Rapid” on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive nobody in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will enable them to take strong positions in the G group of the League of Europe.
The trauma of the knee prevented paralysing Graham Durrans from acting in the season for the first time, at 2:2 vs. Villarreal, but he believed that Rangers could use the result as a springboard to achieve great results.
"It was a good moment for us because Willarreal is a good team," said a 31-year-old football player.
“We entered the game, believing we could get something, and we left with no one.
Perhaps, after all, we could do it, but in general, no one was likely a fair result.
They may have played best in the first half of the day, and our success came from the second time, where we showed ourselves to be better.
On this Thursday, another big European night will be held.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a complicated game, because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a heavy year, given everything that's involved in my injuries and replacements at the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is beautiful, and the boys are really enjoying it; the training has been done on "ura".
I hope we can move forward, leave the last season behind and succeed.”
Women are losing their sleep because of fear for their pension savings
Although the interviewers had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be cared for, few had talked about it with their family.
About half of the people who participated in the national study said that they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10% said that they had spoken to their children on the subject.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't try to discuss the subject with them,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationside on Life Insurance.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and your children — you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Consider with your counselor and family where and how you will receive medical care, as this choice may be an important cost factor.
Consult with your financial adviser to help you develop a payment plan for these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help to cover these costs or self-insured by your own property, provided you have money.
Get your legal documents in order: get rid of your legal weapons.
Create confidence in medical care, and appoint a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in the event that you cannot communicate.
We also recommend that we consider the possibility of developing financial confidence.
A trustee should be selected to assist you in making financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your accounts if you are unable to do so.
Remember, too, the little things: Imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical care and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to provide information on the drugs he takes and on what he has allergies for?
Write down all these details on paper so you can prepare yourself in case you want.
Martin adds: “It is important not only to have money, but also to choose doctors.”
"What kind of medication do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
“Separate and write down the plan.”
In Ilfrakomb, a man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
A man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle, returning home from a party.
The victim, whose chest, stomach and hand had been shot for 40 years, was located in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfrakombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting that occurred at about 02:30 a.m. English summer time as “e.g. accident”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries are not life threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses at the moment.
Disasters and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian town of Palau on Friday, and the number is expected to increase.
Because of the breakdown of communications, rescuers are unable to obtain any information from Donggal, a region north of Palau, which is closer to the 7.5-point epicenter of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palau as a result of the disaster.
Some of the key facts about Palu and Donggal on the island of Sulawesi are:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and a tsunami struck.
Donggala is an area extending over 300 km (180 miles) of the coastal line in the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative district smaller than the province, had 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi and, in particular, of the coastal region of Donggala.
nickel mining is also important for the provincial economy, but it is mainly concentrated in Morvali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, during the past 100 years, the tsunami has been destroyed several times in Palau and Donggala.
In 1938, the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also occurred in the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami in 14 countries that killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 occurred in Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5 - magnitude earthquake occurred on the Isle of Mantai in Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidi Jaya County in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake of 2004 and the tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists in ruins.
Sara Paylin's eldest son is arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trak Paylin, the oldest son of former Governor of Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Pailin, a 29-year-old from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a friend of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Paylin is in Matt-Su detention facility and will be released on bail at $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “unique innocence”.
Peylin is threatened with three minor crimes of Class A, which means that he may be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and fined for $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offence punishable by up to one day ' s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges were brought against Pelin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Pelin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, the falsification of the report on domestic violence and the possession of alcohol-related weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sara Paylin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, after explaining her son ' s brutal behaviour with post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
The Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Video recordings of the incident appear on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palau when the tsunami struck ashore.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office wants to impose a rare death sentence on a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
The Federal Public Prosecutor ' s Office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, which resulted in the death of eight people, a rare punishment for a federal crime that had not been committed in the State since 1953.
In October Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intently” killed eight people and “intently” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to achieve the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court, both charges may result in the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read out a 22-point conviction to Saipov, which included eight charges of crime for rebate murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “pretty planned and deliberate”, Saipov carried it out, as described, “in a repugnant, cruel and criminal manner”.
“Seyfullo Habibullaevich Saip suffered injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Hernan Ferruza, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagukko”, states the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years had passed since the prosecutor had demanded the death penalty in the South District of New York for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment.
For the last time in the federal case in New York, in 1953, the death penalty was applied to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union two years earlier during the cold war.
The Rosenbergs were executed with an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov's court records, a Uzbek national showed that he was not repentant after his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saip told the authorities that he had been inspired to watch the ISIS video on the phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room, reported to the police.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on the side of Saipov, said that they were “extremely disappointed” by a decision of the prosecutor's office.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without possible release will only add to the pain of those events for all those involved,” said Patton.
The defence of Saipov had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Member of Parliament, Tori, said that NAJEL FARAG should not be held responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest conference, Tori Nigel Faraz vowed to “mobilize the People's Army”.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should “feel” Euroseptics, as a member of Parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bow, a member of the conservatives' party, said at the Birmingham rally that Britain would have already “come out” if Mr. Faraz had been Secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May, in an attempt to reconcile its deeply divided ranks, is compounded by the fact that members of the Tori party opposing EU withdrawal join in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is working hard to maintain his compromise plan, which was expressed in Chuckers in the midst of attacks by Brexit, his opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and thus force the Euroseptics and Labourers to choose between her package and the chaos.
Mr. Bow said at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solikhall that he wanted to "play Chucks."
He suggested that Mr. Faraj be leveled and held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would have gone out,” he said.
Wellingborough added, "I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we need to play Chuckers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Boun rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their views and wanted to remain is totally wrong”.
Brexit's support for Tori Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, giving journalists this comment: "I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people."
“Checkers is not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote in favour of this plan, nor is it popular among the members of our party and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and first and foremost electing us.
Please put it aside and start listening to what you are being told."
In her harsh address to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers shall remain in their work if they remain true to their promises”.
Mr. Faraz said that if politicians were to submit the 2016 referendum decision, then they should be forced to “feel”.
“It is now a matter of trust between us, people and our political class”, he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you get away with it."
Turning to the delighted crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of the betrayal of Brexit, to feel at ease.
“We are mobilizing the people's army of this country to win the Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent and proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit’s opponents took a demonstration at Birmingham and held a two - hour rally in the center of the city.
Several activists waved Tory vs. Brexit posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, criticized conservatives for security problems in their party's mobile application.
“And these people say they can set up Canada's IT systems and technologies plus to work on borders, to free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“It's one complete farce.
Good Brexit does not exist in principle,” he claims.
Warren plans to “explorely” the possibilities of participating in the presidential race
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Member of the U.S. Parliament, says that after the November elections, she will “explorely explore the possibilities of running for presidents”.
The Boston Globe reports that a democracy from Massachusetts on Saturday told about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against a member of the Republic Party, Jeff Dile, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There's talk that she's got a chance to take Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held another meeting with voters in Holioca; since Trump took office, it has been her 36th meeting with voters in town hall format.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to start up” our broken government, which requires a woman upstairs.
As a result of the murder of Sims (stuckled), the player LSU was arrested
The Baton Rousse Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect of the murder of a basketball player LSU Wade Sims on Friday was arrested.
At 11:00 a.m., at a press conference, the police of Baton Ruz announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, aged 20.
On Friday, the Police Department published a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify the person who was able to make the video.
A 20-year-old, Sims, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
“Weyd Sims was shot in the head, resulting in his death”, stated Police Chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade went for his friend and was shot dead by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being involved in the incident, carrying a weapon and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist during his arrest and was detained in the police department of the East Baton Ruz district.
The young man grew up in Baton Ruz and played 32 games with 10 startups in the last season and gained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 points per game.
Grand Du Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the title of the world champion after command tactics have given him victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the time that Valter Bottas was trained on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes command tactics would play a major role in the race.
He's already been very good at starting up and hanging out on Hamilton since Poul-Screech Bottas when he was defending his position on the first two corners, and he invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go to the pit-stop, leaving Hamilton in the tail of the whole group, a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes went one circle after another and then came behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some struggle with the wheel, broke out, leading the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the interior space open, risking being caught after a double movement to protect himself on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstapen started from the back of the grid and was seventh in place by the end of the first circle.
He then led most of the race, sticking to his native tires, with the aim of quickly bringing Kim Ryckonen to fourth place.
He eventually went to the pit stop on the 44th circle, but he couldn't increase the pace of the remaining eight circles, because Ryckonen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day, since Valteri had done a fantastic job on the weekend and had shown true generosity by sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in the reserve," said Hamilton.
Presumptuous sign language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Dainn Fainsstein at his meeting with the voters on Saturday for saying that she had failed to publish a letter from Christine Blacey Ford, accused of Bretta Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of Supreme Justice, for sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, saying that what was taking place in the Senate had shown that the participants in those events were “stupid, disgusting and false people”.
“The only possible response to all of this, and what's going on in the Senate in the last few days, is beautiful, is anger, anger, disgustingness and lies,” he said.
"You see all these leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Daenn Feinsstein, did you "listen" the information?
Remember her answer... did you "listen" the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.
Okay, stop.
No, we didn't "suck," he added with a senator's inflammation.
In July, Feynstein sent a letter detailing the charges against Cavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally publicized, but Fainsstein denies that the leak took place at her office.
“I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, but I didn't leak her information,” Feynstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she requested.”
However, the manner in which she denied the charges of diversion did not seem to like the President who commented on it during the Saturday meeting: “This is what I will tell you: the body's tongue has failed her.
Maybe she didn't "swallow," but the body's language was the worst I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend his candidate for the post of Supreme Justice, who had been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and suggested that democracies used those charges for their own ends.
“They are definitely trying to regain power in all available ways.
"We see guile, abominableness, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're going to have to move through to get power and control," quotes the President's Mediaite.
British Hockey League: "Dandy Stars" 5-3 "Belafast Jayants"
Patrick Duyer scored two points for the Jayants in a game against the Dundee.
In the games of the Elite Hockey League, Dundy Stars paid for the Friday defeat against Belfast Jayants, winning the Saturday match with 5-3 in favour of the Dundee.
Jayants was given an early two-point advantage due to the beatings of Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowiller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the household team before Doyer led the Jayants into leadership.
François Bushhar compared the "Dandi" account before two of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's goals secured their victory.
For Adam Kiff, who won the Dundee at 2:1 in Belfast on Friday evening, this was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
It was a fourth meeting between the parties during the season when the Jayants won the three previous games.
Duyer's first goal came four minutes to 3:35 after Kendall McFall's head belt, with David Rutherford's support, and then Bovier doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned his owners to the game at 1:10 a.m. before Matt Markwardt helped Cooney level the bill at 15:16.
Duyer found out that Jayants had seized the initiative in the first break when he scored the second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The owners regrouped, and Bouchar again leveled the score by scored at 27.37 p.m.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nielsen give the Dundee a chance for the first time to gain leadership at the end of the second period, after which he and his team established a victory by holding rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Jayants, who have lost four of the last five matches to date, are on their way to Milton Cains for the next match to be held on Friday.
Air traffic controller killed so that hundreds of people on board could escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously given the title of a hero after he had deliberately gone to death in order to enable a plane with hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many were missing as a result of the severe earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, which caused the tsunami.
Strong underground push continues to destroy the area, and many residents of the city of Palau have been hit by the debris of buildings.
Despite the fact that his colleagues were fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antónius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the frightening airstrip of Mutiara Cis Al Jufrie airport, the town of Palu.
He stayed where he was to make sure that the Batik Air Light 6321 aircraft, which was at the time on the airstrip, was able to take off safely.
Then, when he felt that the tower was falling, he jumped off it.
Later, he died in a hospital.
The representative of Indonesia ' s air navigation said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be taken to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter took off to Palau.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of people killed by the earthquake may reach thousands because, according to the disaster management agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Siga and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to be increasing, as a large number of people are still under debris and many have never been able to get out of it,” says a representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The ships, which reached a height of six feet [6 m], devastated the city of Palu, where the mass burial of the dead would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft deliver humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Rice Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says Sky News: "Salvation brings victims every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets have been looted everywhere.”
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, tells CNN: “The staff of the Indonesian Red Cross are already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know that they will be there.
The tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but it can be much worse.”
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, arrived in Palau on Sunday and addressed the country ' s armed forces, inter alia: “I ask all of you to work night and day to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? ” CNN explains.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
An accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one person disappeared after the crash of an airplane in a lagoon
The airline, a victim of a crash in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing, whereas it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reports that on Saturday afternoon she has no information about one male passenger.
The airline stated that it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and the police in trying to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
The local sailors helped save the other passengers and the aircraft crew after they fell to the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven persons had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that on Saturday six passengers had been hospitalized and all were in stable condition.
The reasons for the plane crash and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The United States Airlines and Navy claim that the aircraft landed in the Lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft was unable to land on the airstrip.
American passenger Bill Janes says the plane started entering the airstrip too low.
"And that's very good," Janes adds.
Janes told us that he and other passengers were able to make emergency exits on a sinking plane because the water level was belt-down.
He also told us that the stewards panicked and shouted on board and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing the quays nearby also helped rescue by using an inflated boat, on which they carried people to the shore, before the aircraft sank about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have been killed in the past two decades in aircraft accidents involving companies registered in PNG, but none of these accidents were related to Air Niugini.
The intelligence analyst was able to prove that the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution brought a case against a man accused of burning a resident of Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett gave long-term testimony as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the department how he used his cell phone records to provide an overview of the actions of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Roulette said that he had obtained data on the location of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, the night Tellis spent with Chambers, which was contrary to his previous testimony, reported The Clarion Ledger.
He said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information received, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when that proved to be the case, the police questioned Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that “this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville”.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, they were called within one week, according to telephone records.
Rowlett also showed that shortly after Chambers Tellis died, he removed text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale says.
The defence must begin to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Brad: What's an informed hip-hop?
Trio hip hoppers are going to fight a negative attitude towards this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Brad Group from Bristol argues that hip hop content has changed from the original political and social problems.
The members of the group want to go back to their roots and make the “knowable” hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugues and the Common have recently witnessed a revival in Britain thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
The New York nanny sued the couple because of the racist text
A New York nanny sued a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny had been “other black” and that the woman had mistakenly sent the babysitter instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the action is filed with the “purpose of extortion”.
Lancey Placco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she learned that the new baby-care nurse, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived at the family home for her first working day in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
However, instead of texting her husband, she sent him twice in error, Ms. Morris.
Realizing that she was ill-advised, Placco-Flexman fired Maurice, claiming in the service that the nanny, who had proved to be an African American, was doing a bad job, and at all, what they expected was a Filipino rather than an African-American woman, reports New York Post.
Morris was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple and seeking compensation for the dismissal of $350 per day in six months, in accordance with the terms of the original oral arrangement, which, however, were not fixed by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she said on Friday, adding, “and I know that this is discrimination”.
Spouses disagreed with the charge of racism and argued that the dismissal of Maurice could be considered a reasonable step, since they could no longer trust her if they offended her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't really mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, ” said Joe Plasco, the Post.
"But you would have trusted your children with someone you were rude to, even if you were heavy, if you didn't want to?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on!"
Calling the action “the extortion”, Plasco said that his wife had a child only two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“And you are prepared to persecute the person in this situation?
Not very nice of you," added an investment banker.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already handed down its sentence on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behaviour and logical issues.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would not understand the move with a talking bear, says a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publication, responded to the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the work for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny to know that Paddington is very successful."
She also reported that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the bear, was an operator on BBC, and would be optimistic about the publication being rejected, and added that the 60-year anniversary of his books was “and happy and bitter” because the author had not been.
As for Paddington's bear itself, she refers to it as “a very important member of our family”, and that her father was very proud that his character had finally become known.
"He was a quiet and modest man," his daughter says.
“Vaude Paddington was so real to him, and it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of them, although he did not really consider that success to be his own credit.
I think that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he has always paid tribute to the bear itself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to Nizza Hospital, Nizza Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“We called regularly and said that everything was really bad, that something had gone wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa.
“Then he called again and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that we should say good-bye.
I did.
I said, "Tashy, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her while making her heart work gradually ceased to function as she left her body.
She died before she was expected.
I had to just sit and wait knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I could not cry or scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself tight."
After all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, accepting the enormous loss she had just suffered.
“No one around us knew what had happened, ” she says.
“ My head went down, and I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this all-encompassing feeling of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her."
Women survivors prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide try to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey put comforting cards on the Welles Bridge and telephone numbers on which people can turn for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to experience what I experience every day, ” she says.
A 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, says that her son was a great cook and had a fucking lovely smile.
“All loved his smile.
Everyone said when he smiled, it was as if the lights were lit in the room."
But he left his job before he died because he was experiencing a truly terrible time.”
That was in 2014, and Tyler lost his life and found his own brother, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, "I don't stop afraid it's going to be a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis designed these cards so people know there's someone to talk to and talk to, even if it's your friend.
You can't sit and talk, you need to talk to people."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, who lived with him for 15 years, and he did not exist shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling depressed, upset or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
Christmas was particularly bad for him: he didn't even look at the children when they opened their gifts."
She says that his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to go through it, and this event shocked our family.
It broke her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Bretta Cavanaugh hangs in his hair: the FBI is launching an investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — an investigation limited in time and volume — we could bring some unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would be “disintegrated” against a growing party chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Time is the cause of their fluctuations.
Intermediate elections will be held in only five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as is expected, everything is bad for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to obtain the person they want and to elect him as the highest judge of the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavano, who has since worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, has met his future wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 democracies.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the issue of equality of votes and confirm his candidature for the post of Supreme Justice.
The number of North Korean defectors decreased at Kim
Since Kim Jong Eun came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean exiles in South Korea has declined, a South Korean legislator stated.
Pak Bian Seug, referring to the data of the Ministry of the South, stated that, compared to the 2,706 escape cases recorded in 2011, the figure had dropped to 1,127 last year.
Mr. Park said that the key factors had been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates imposed by smugglers.
He doesn't give any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are ultimately offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people are running through China with the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views the defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subject them to forced repatriation.
The North-South relationship, which is still in a state of war, has improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pigniane to resume the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was following the historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Ying in Singapore in June, at which they reached common agreements on disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, accused the United States of preventing its sanctions from progress in this regard.
“If we do not have the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to begin disarmament unilaterally”, said Mr. Ree in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Cavanano "serious" and claims that he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi named Bretta Cavanano, a candidate for the post of Supreme Justice, as “sterist” and said that because of his temperament, he was not suitable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pesoli made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival event in Ostina, Texas.
“I cannot help but think that if a woman had ever allowed herself to act in this way, she would have been called a ‘cancer’,” says Pelosi of his reaction to Kavano’s testimony in the Senate’s Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavanano emotionally denied Dr. Christine Blacey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment, which allegedly occurred when they were both teenagers.
Cavanano acted emotionally enough, sometimes even suffocating and suffocating about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the democrats of the committee, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and well-planned murder of the active person”, organized by the liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Kavano ' s testimony had only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a biased attitude towards the democracies.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his claims and the way he attacks the Clintons and democracies,” she says.
The Pelosí was outraged when she was asked if she would try to hold Cavanaugh accountable if his guilt was confirmed and if the democracies received a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI, he is not only good for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he is currently on,” said Pelosi.
Kavano is currently a judge of the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Cavanaugh with regard to the Access to Health Care Act or Row v. Wade, as he was considered to be a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearing on his candidature, Cavanaugh asked whether he would override some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not the time to let a mindless and biased man go to the position of supreme judge, but to say, ‘How excellent!’ ”
And women should have it.
It is righteous anger, months and years of rage, and it cannot pass through without tears.
"When we're angry, we're crying," Miss Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think?"
She went on to say, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was working in a leadership position somewhere, and she told me that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that explained to her interlocutor, "You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really angry."
And then she just kept talking.
I was impressed by this approach.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in the office where men dominated me was crying out of rage once, but I was caught by an elderly woman who was a heartless manager, who I've always been afraid of, and dragged into a ladder.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're crying for anger.
They think you're upset, and they're glad that they've finally led you away."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some minor affair and left the race, and Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to prevent her from running for the presidency.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it the White White and the Seven Dwarfs.
The campaign was already nearing its end, and it was very short of fund-raising, and so she vowed not to take part in the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men offered her only 250.
“What am I for them, a valued product, or what?” she wondered.
When she spoke, declaring that she would not carry out a formal campaign, she was so engrossed in emotions — thanks to the people who supported her, disappointment with a system that made it so difficult to collect money and access voters, and anger over gender discrimination that she gasped.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the press had reacted to her.
"It might have been thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still wondering, what would they write on my monument?
"She sobbed all the time?"
How the trade war with America can be useful for Beijing
The experts believe that the first episodes of the United States-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the divisions between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, issued the first warning early this year, taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The largest escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected $200 billion ($150 billion) products, effectively taxing half of all Chinese products in the United States.
Beijing has every time inflicted an amount of counter-attacks, recently imposing obligations on American products amounting to $60 billion in between 5 and 10 per cent.
China has promised that the response against the United States will be equivalent each time, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to begin to experience at least the slightest difficulty in the near future.
To force Washington to retreat means to give up, but it would be too shameful for the U.S. president of China, C. Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the United States trade war pressure could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of two economies.
“The fact that a quick political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to an economic collapse in any of these countries is in fact much more dangerous than observers previously recognized, ” says Abigail Grace, a scientist at the New American Security Analysis Centre (Centre for New America Security), a specialist in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “ready” to return refugees
Syria states that it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks assistance in the reconstruction of a country that has been devastated by a war of more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem reported that conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and secure as a result of success in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government is continuing to rebuild areas that have been destroyed by terrorists so that people can live in peace.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they have had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful to assist in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance under any circumstances or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe Conquests Victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018, winning the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Gold National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US has lost six consecutive times on European soil and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe returned the crown thanks to a team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn, who gained the 14.5 points they needed to conquer the United States.
The American star Phil Miquelson, who fought hard most of the tournament, made his first long-range hit in the water on the 16th hole of steam 3, giving up his match of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds by becoming the 1st to 4 players who ever walked 5 to 0 because the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated by a 5-4 player with the lowest rating on the European team, Turbjourn Olive, from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, gave way to 2:1 Jan Polter of England, who may have been involved in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Sergio Garcia, a Spanish veteran of eight Ryder Cups, won a tournament in European history with 25.5 points per career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t hold back today.
It was a complicated year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get a cup again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," says emotional Garcia after European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Rama, who won the American golf legend by Tiger Woods on Sunday at 2:1 in a single game.
“I am incredibly proud of this victory — I grew up watching the game of Tiger Woods,” says 23 - year - old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are rather strange for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 major titles, only giving up on Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend in vain to try to succeed, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaou, who demonstrated the golf of the highest class throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fürck said after his team made a disillusionment: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we managed a little bit to shake Europe.
It didn't work.
We're taking our hats off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played great.
We are regrouping, I will work with PGA America and our Committee Ryder Cup, and we will move forward to success.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be good at losing.
We have lost.”
Red tide: The concentration of micro-organisms declined in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The last report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reflects the overall decline in the concentration of red tides in some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Koler there is a high incidence of color, indicating a decrease in the concentration of micro-organisms.
The red tide extends approximately 130 miles off the coast from northern Pinell to southern Li districts.
Places can be observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough, but their numbers have declined significantly since last week.
The red tide is also observed in the Pasco district.
Last week, average concentrations in and near Pinellas were reported, from low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough Coastal Area, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasota and coastal areas, average concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations on the Li Coastal Coast and low concentrations in Koler County.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Koler, there is still a risk of air-traffic irritation.
No such possibility was reported in northwestern Florida last week.
