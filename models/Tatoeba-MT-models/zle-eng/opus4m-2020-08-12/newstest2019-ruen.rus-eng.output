Number of new recruits from Ukraine ready to be sent to Donbas
The spokesman of the People ' s Militia for the self-proclaimed Lugano People ' s Republic (LPR) Andrei Marochko stated that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbas.
He said that Kiev was planning “somehow to complete the units”.
“The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to perform military service in Ukraine, the mass dismissals have resulted in a low number of units”, said Morocco, quoted as “RIA News”.
It also did not rule out that the actual numbers of Ukrainians in the army could be increased if necessary.
The so-called anti-terrorism operation (ATO) began in 2014 - 2017 and was later replaced by the Joint Forces (JS) operation.
This measure was expected to enhance the role of Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbasa was aggravated by the murder of Alexander Zakharchenko, head of NAM.
The NAM authorities described what happened as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several persons involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversification had been organized by Ukrainian intelligence services.
U.S. authorities forced Mask to leave the office of Chairman of the Tesla Board
The American businessman Ilon Musk will resign as chairman of the Board of Directors of the Tesla Company, at the request of the U.S. authorities.
In order to resolve the claims of the Federal Security and Exchange Commission, the enterprise will also pay $20 million to cover its claims.
According to the CNBC television channel, pre-trial arrangements with the agency allow mask to remain in the leadership position in Tesla.
In doing so, he is obliged to pay $20 million and to leave the office of chairman of the Board of Directors within 45 days of the agreement and for no less than three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is specified that the agreement is yet to be approved by the court.
On 28 September, it became known that the United States Security and Exchange Commission had accused Muska of misleading shareholders of having sufficient funds to buy the company's shares and had filed an application with a businessman in court.
It's about publishing a businessman on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy a $420 share for something, but he didn't.

The head of British MIDA compared the EU with the Soviet Union and the prison
The British Foreign Minister, Jeremy Hunte, compared the European Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of enslaving the member countries of the community.
The diplomat made this statement at the meeting of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham on Sunday, 30 September.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from the community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner willing to flee from captivity,” the Minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to withdraw from the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes The Gazette.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the Brexit negotiations had been stalled.
In this way, she commented on the outcome of the EU informal summit in Strasbourg.
The Brexit decision was adopted in 2016 following a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London has left the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.

Also, the villagers of the village formed and took away the Governor of the Altay Province a mass collective treatment “in response to the prevailing catastrophic situation”.
Boronin himself reported that he felt normal, and that he was fully in charge of the hunger strike.

To date, however, no one has started this work.
The head of the village also protested against the lack of adequate control and support from the Government of the Altay Province and against the financial policy of Gaspromregionalgas Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the villages for the winter, Boronin required “immediately to establish a fully-fledged community site in the territory of the municipality with the respective staff units”.

They account for about 35 per cent of financial income.

Telegram users complained about the failure of the new version
The iPhone users complained about the problems of the Telegram Messinger after the update of 28 September.
The user's phone number can be found by his address
The complaints relate to guesses with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after updating, the application shows a white screen or closes immediately.
Messinger's representatives responded to the malfunction.
According to them, the problem could be the migration of information to a new Swift-language application.
The Telegram has temporarily suspended the automatic updating of the application before correcting the problems.
On 13 April, the Tagan court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's claim to block the messing up of Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, communication operators began implementing the decision.
The reason for this was the failure of the Messinger Administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decoding the correspondence necessary to obtain terrorist data.
In August, Telegram changed its policy of confidentiality and agreed to reveal the IP address and the mobile phone number of the terrorist suspect when a court decision was reached.

Bob Hartley's chief coach, Avangarda, summarized the regular KHL championship match against the Minsk Dinamo (2:1).
A very important victory for us.
After a match in St. Petersburg, we held a meeting and agreed to leave the game behind and prepare for Minsk.
We knew Dinamo had a good victory before our meeting, so we were preparing very seriously.
It was important to throw it in the majority, and I'm happy for the guys who went out to realize the numerical advantage.
We've played pretty well for most of the time, but we couldn't do anything about it.
Finally, the red light lit behind the gates.
We knew Minsk would come out loaded at the game, try and do it that way.
The game has become the determining goal, the winning goal we've scored in unequal compositions.
We were able to spend a good third period today, despite the fact that we missed an early goal in that segment and understood that it would be difficult to do so.
But we played very well in defense, we didn't give a lot of chances to the rival, we weren't allowed to catch us on a shift, the Dinamo didn't have an attack with a numerical advantage, so it ended well for us, and it turns out Hartley's Om club press service.

Ilon Musk is forced to leave the post of Chief of the Tesla Board of Directors
The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission and founder Tesla Ilon Musk settled their dispute in a fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, as part of the agreements reached, Muska would have to leave the post of Chief of the Tesla Board of Directors.
In doing so, the Commission allowed Muska to retain the post of head of Tesla.
It is noted that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount is recovered from Tesla.
The money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American businessman on the list of 50 richest people on the planet, according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX Corporation, Neurallink Neurallink neurotechnician, and the creator of the Tesla electricians, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission had previously filed a complaint against the Director General of Tesla Ilona Muska because of his Twitter report of a possible ransom to the company.
Last month Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares on a fixed price exchange at $420.
The value of the $420 share was allegedly “due to the importance of this number in the marijuana culture”, reported earlier to the Bloomberg agency, with reference to the director of the security department of the Stephen Peykin Commission.
In doing so, Ilon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy shares.
Commenting on a lawsuit filed against him by the United States Security and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered the allegations of fraud to be unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and upset by these claims.
"History is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove I didn't break it in any way," said the businessman in CEBC's interview.
In August, however, a group of shareholders from Tesla filed a collective claim against Maska, complaining of the financial losses suffered.
The plaintiffs claimed that the business man’s posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the business man's Twitters had been misleading, which had forced the Tesla equity sellers to purchase paper at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that Ilonma Muska’s reckless remarks led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Muska accused the head of Cetron Research of trading fraud.
However, if Musk were unable to resolve his dispute with the US securities and exchange commission, he would be in danger of being suspended from the company ' s management and even prison.
This was reported, inter alia, to CNBC by the former Chairman of the Commission, Harvey Pitt.
Musk is a "good guy who can't drive a car company."

The head of the External Church Relations Division of the Moscow patriarchate of the Mitropolitan Volocoloma Ilarion compared the possible name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Fascists in Germany.
Mitropolitan Volocoloma - the causes of the conflict with the Constantinople patriarchate, the possible division of the church and its political overtones
According to him, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage”, to rename the church is as if in Nazi Germany, “Jews were getting the yellow six-pointed star”.
“This means to mark the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that the bill was created”, said the representative of the RPC on the television channel Russia 24.
Mitropol also stressed that the UCP is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, since “the believers of that church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country”.

The result of our meeting with car manufacturers should be in the foreseeable future just the creation of the Russian ill “Formula-1”, which has no parallel in the world,” said Dimitri Kozak.
We must simplify our car manufacturers in this direction.
These were plans until 2024, but I don't think it's possible.
I think a more realistic time frame will be over the next 10 years."
From 2012 to 2014, Marusa spoke under Russian licence at Forum One.
According to the Vice Prime Minister, there are already investors willing to invest in the creation of a national team in the World's "Formula 1" racing championship.
I know that Russia has car sports lovers, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, who are willing to invest in the establishment of a Russian team called "Formula One," he said.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like this.
I suspect that the idea of establishing a team has also arisen because of the infrastructure in Sochi.”
The Sochi Autodrome is waiting for the Angel tomorrow.
According to Dimitri Kozak, the organizers were able to make all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even the performance of the rostrum was almost complete, as the Vice-Primeman noted.
I can say that this year's revenue increased by 72% compared to last year.
It's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the effectiveness of Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The opening of the penicillin marked the beginning of an era of modern antibiotics, brought world fame to Fleming, and made it a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the release of penicillin from mold mushrooms was not the first discovery of Fleming.
Some years earlier, when he was in a cold, he had sown a mucus from his own nose on Petri's cup (this is such a glass lid where experiments are made with bacteria) and a few days later found that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
Almost by accident, they also discovered penicillin.
The name Fleming has been added to the list of 100 of the most outstanding personalities in human history.
His discovery, according to many scholars, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine has begun to cope with most of the oldest diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene....

Trump told me about "in love" in Kim Jong Eun
The leaders of the United States and the DPRK were almost in love with each other, joking Donald Trump.
President Donald Trump of the United States was a good joke about his success in resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now corrected relations so much that they are almost in love with each other, the President of the United States noted.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main challenge in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had established such a relationship with the DPRK that they could not even reach the country's leadership -- they simply didn't take the phone off.
The United States and the DPRK were on the verge of war at that time, and today the North Korean leader writes "pretty letters" to the White House, Trump noted.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, there was also a "frust" against Kim Chen Eun, which was mutual.
Now, however, their relationship has been rectified to the point that the leaders are “in love with each other”.
However, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that American media interpret them as incompetence.
Trump pointed out that Phenyang had recently stopped nuclear and missile testing and had also closed the military zones.
All these are the merits of his administration, I'm sure the American president.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flattered Kim Jong Eun from the UN General Assembly rostrum.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and the steps taken to deescalate tensions.
Trump noted, however, that sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore

A positive outcome of the meeting was the cessation of the DPRK ' s nuclear and missile tests, as well as the return to the United States of America of the remains of American soldiers.
At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are being towed.
The media reported that after the Singapore Summit, the United States had sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Phenyang rejected them as “Gangster”.

Nice called for the replacement of the “Moscow language by the Ukrainian product”
The Ukrainian child writer and advocate for the purity of Larissa Nitsoy's mother tongue called for the expulsion from Ukraine of “Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language”.
To do so, she proposes a Ukrainian product - “cultural wave, cultural pressure”.
Nietsoy shared her views on “the usefulness of eradicating Russian in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian edition of “Surveyer”.
She said that the relevant Ukrainian product was now being prepared - it was even being eaten and was continuing to develop.
In time, Ukrainians will “health” this “Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said that Russian speech had previously been widely used on television and radio, but that it was virtually nonexistent in public space.
In Nietza's view, however, Ukrainians do not resort to aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian are, in its view, merely “the extension of borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Nitza had previously shared experiences in maintaining the “Ukrainian-speaking regime” in the Karpata children's camp, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened a network of Watsons bookstores, one of which had been contacted by a cashier in Russian.
Before she reached her goal, Nitsa threw herself into the girl's hand.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians, she calls it "language schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of family names.
Nice said recently that the name "Rus" had been stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service was unable to avoid an angry writer: when she came there and heard the conversations of the staff members in Russian, she had a scandal and had left by slamming the door.
A man’s conversation was interrupted, and it produced results
The defender of the Urala, Denis Kulakov, is about victory over the Arsenal (2:1) in the ninth round of the Russian championship.
"Danis, what do you think you were able to win?"
"I think we wanted more to win," says Kulakov's official website, "Urala."
"This complicated game was done, and there was a break in a serious male conversation, which bore fruit: two balls were scored and not missed.
"You missed a few matches because of the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today?"
"If I've had 90 minutes, then I'm fine!
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe at the end of the day, there's a little bit of strength to keep things from happening.
Doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatollevich Gashnev have led me to this game, for which they are so grateful!
"What do you say about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that, after winning and reviving, it's easier, and there's a good mood in the collective.
Now we've got a white stripe, though it was black at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and please the fans."
You miss the game for the time you didn't go out on the field?
I said, "There's something that's a little boring because it's really a bad situation.
But again, thank you for the physical therapist and the doctors who put them on their feet.
Most importantly, we won and comforted the fans.
The rest of it is secondary."

Violations recorded in the referendum in Macedonia
Four incidents involving violations of electoral law were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, Tony Angelowski.
Since the opening of the polling stations, there had been four incidents that had been resolved, he said.
K.J., 22-year-old, violated public order and tranquillity, insulted citizens and attacked policemen at the Lazo Angelowski elementary school in Skopje.
He was detained and taken to the police station.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all violators were immediately taken to police stations.
The Ministry noted that all violations were subject to verification.
“The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can enjoy peacefully the constitutional right freely to express their will.
We call upon citizens to comply with the laws and to refrain from any disturbance of public order and tranquillity and any violation of the secrecy of voting,” said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Citizens are asked during the referendum on Sunday to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?”
The referendum is intended to resolve the 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
On 17 June, the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which is bordering between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the title “Republic of Northern Macedonia”.
This treaty should resolve not only a multi-year dispute over the name of the country, but also opens the way to NATO and the EU.

The Pachian hopes to hold early elections to the Armenian Parliament in 2018
Elections to the Armenian Parliament can be held as early as 2018, as stated by the Prime Minister of the country, Nicole Pasinian.

The prosecution for the Dagestan deputy became news
The Soviet District Court of Mahakkala detained for two months a member of the Dagestan Rajab Abdoulatipov People ' s Assembly, a suspect of participation in a criminal community who had established disability for bribes.
The “Acknowledge” became known as the details of the investigation material that shed light on, inter alia, the version of the Russian Investigative Committee, the younger brother of the former Head of the Republic of Ramazán, Abdulatipov Rajab Abdoulatipov, has now contributed to criminal action by the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Sciences, Magomed Mahachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, during the search and investigation activities conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was found that Rajab Abdoulatipov had lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as head of the office, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles for this purpose.
We recall earlier that criminal proceedings were initiated against Magomed Mahachev, other leaders and staff of the territorial medical and social expertise offices under his supervision, under article 210 (establishment of a criminal association using official position and participation), article 290 (receipt of a bribe by an organized group), article 292 (individual fraud) and article 159 (in particular large-scale fraud) of the Criminal Code.
According to the results of the investigation, in late 2013, Rajab Abdoulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Mahachev and his associates in the theft of the Pension Fund, joined them in their activities by joining the criminal community.
In charge of the Russian Federal Migration Service for Dagestan and in contact with State authorities and law enforcement agencies, and in the use of his close relationship with the Head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdoulatipov, the investigators consider that he “ensured the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with State officials in support of the illegal activities of Magod Mahachev and his position as head of the federal executional institution “The Chief Medical and Social Expert Office for the Republic of Dagestan” organized the illegal establishment of disabilities by citizens”.
Following the announcement of the information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdoulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything I'm charged with today, it's all new to me, I'm not familiar with it," he said.
The Court arrested a deputy from “One Russia” not for 10 days before the charge was brought, as had been the case with previous Israeli high-ranking officials, but for a period of two months, as he appeared under article 210 of the Criminal Code.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time for the investigation to be charged, up to 45 days from the time of detention.

The day before, it had become known that the Serbian President had brought the State army into full readiness because of the situation in Kosovo.
This is what happened last Friday when several dozen special forces from Kosovo entered the area adjacent to the water-supply lake “Gazivodé”.
It is specified that the nuclear power plant is located in Kosovo, but it applies to the Serbian power system.
We will recall that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, but in Belgrade this fact was denied recognition.
Last spring, the parties ceased negotiations on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the subject of Russia was practically missing in negative terms.
The Head of the Federation ' s Committee on International Affairs, Constantine Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly a success for Russia and does not exclude it from becoming a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral part of the solution to global world problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric we've almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been in order,” said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation had sometimes “assigned as one of the three major threats to humanity, along with Ebola's fever, the Russian Federation, along with climate change or terrorism, was in this series, in any case, of a group of Western countries, which had spoken in a rather unanimous manner”.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev emphasized that “the subject of Russia was practically absent in a negative way”.
"If I carefully analyse the statement made by the President of the United States, President of France, the Foreign Minister of Germany, I'm not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the chorus wasn't exactly accurate," he said, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall that has been trained by the tennis ball."
The Head of the Soutfed Professional Committee does not exclude that this indicates some trend which he believes “will distinguish the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully apparent in a year, two, three”.
“I do not exclude that this session can in some sense be a turning session”, Kosachev admitted, explaining that “if there are many examples of Russia's progress in international affairs with Russia's involvement”.
He cited as an example the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“Not until this is unfortunately Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be used in time,” the parliamentarian added.
This is linked to what he believes is the “appropriate, healthy perception of Russia as more than just a possible, integral participant in solving the global problems of our time”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we're somewhere passing a point where the movement is no longer going back, it's going to be moving forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Kosachev referred to “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and I had my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that, if one year or two or five years ago, the Russian view of what was happening in the world was largely uninterested, the situation is now different,” said the Chairman of the Sofed Committee.
In his view, this was because “the so-called new liberal order, which is associated with the West, lacks answers to questions on how to deal with world problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to address the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration”.
“And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming increasingly clear”, expressed the confidence of Kosachev, stressing that it considers this session “to be a good one for the work of the Russian delegation, which is good for Russia”.

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province of Idlib there will be no use of military force, as stated by the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
He said that Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had an opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the withdrawal of militants of the Russian-banned Jebhat al-Nusra organization from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reporting RIA Novosti.
The Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to military solutions to the problem of the territories east of the Euphrates if Kurds were to seek separatism.
However, according to Muallem, negotiations with Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted by the United States.
On 17 September, Putin and President Reggie Erdogan of Turkey agreed to establish a demilitarized zone by 15 October along the line of contact between the armed opposition and Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led a youth team called Chelsea.
Previously, it was reported that a 37-year-old defence lawyer negotiated the transition to the Moscow Spartacus.
According to RT, referring to Mirror, former commander of prefabricated England John Terry led the youth team Chelsea.
According to the source, a well-known player who has served for a long time as a member of the London Club will run the team for no more than 23 years.
It's been noted that Terry's coaching staff will replace Jody Morris who left for "Derbie County."
Recall, in September, Terry was close to the transition to the Moscow Spartacus, but he finally gave up the idea after talking to his family.
The first Vice-President of the Supreme Council, Irina Heraschenko, apologized to the accused in the Russian Federation for “spioneing” Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushenko for not yet being released from prison.
She said this in a video address to a political prisoner on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushenko FSB.
She said that there was an action under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris during those days, which had been hungry and had demanded the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, including people who know you well, are starving, supporting Oleg Senzov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you are.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interviews wherever the President of Ukraine, Ukrainian authorities, all of us have demanded pressure on the Kremlin, pressure on Putin with one demand: the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and of those children illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbasa and Crimea,” he said.
She also expressed her confidence that the trials would stab every Ukrainian, making us “wicked, stronger in the protection of the national interests of Ukraine, in the protection of each Ukrainian, in the understanding of what is good and what is bad”.
We will recall that Roman Sushenko, a correspondent of Uchrinform in France, was arrested by Russian soldiers at Moscow airport on 30 September 2016.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage by the General Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defence.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushenko to 12 years of a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia declared this verdict to be lawful.
The Russian prisoners granted the Ukrainian last request before being placed in a colony.
NASA reported an asteroid the size of Big Ben approaching Earth
NASA, an American space agency, reported that a large SSP1 asteroid could reach 160 metres in length.
According to Daily Express, a space object may extend beyond the height of the famous Big Ben or London vision wheel.
However, no precise data on the size of the data is yet available.
The speed at which SP1 moves is about 60,000 km/h. The lowest distance between asteroid and Earth will be on 3 October.
Then it's going to fly past our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first observed on 19 September.
NASA has assigned it to near-Earth objects.
Earlier, on 27 September, a Japanese aerospace research agency released the first video ever from the surface of the Rugu asteroid.
Two Japanese Rovers (planetists) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe were able to produce unique images.

Vakhtang Kikabidze on cancer control
Many artists are now talking about how they have managed oncology.
Sadly, the disease spares no one, and the history of popular people who have won cancer gives hope to many who are ill.
The famous actor Wakhtang Kikabidze confessed to living only because of his wife.
Years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a sentence.
"It's like I was hit with a hammer from the bottom of my skull.
I fell.
He's lost his focus.
We put it in the hospital.
The spoon couldn't hold, it couldn't stand, it fell all the time.
It's starting to do tests, it turns out it's a bad thing, the artery doesn't go through with blood.
They brought it to Moscow, they said I had a big dungy cyst in my head, they had an emergency operation.
And during the surgery, the doctors saw the tumor behind the cyst," told Kikabidze on "One Day."
The tumor was malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol on the doorstep of his home.
But the actor's wife didn't let a live actor be buried, she believed she could handle the disease, and she didn't leave her beloved wife's bed for over a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had critical situations, she was next to me like a rock," admitted the actor.
The actor managed the disease, and now he lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, rumours of his illness, and of the untimely death which comes to pass on the Net.
The creators of the Miroca site have introduced Peter Sierrato, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, into the section “Citry”.
The reason was “a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the neighbouring country referred to “direct threats of invasion into Ukraine” and “support for separatist sentiment in Ukraine”, as well as to “in the organization of provocation aimed at the massive violation of Ukrainian legislation by Ukrainian citizens”.
Note that Paul and the representative of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriots) of Onufria, the Deputy of the Kiev-Pecher Lavra, agreed to Cyarto in Chisticia.
Their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian local church led to their opposition.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatya, the President of Ukraine, Peter Porosenko, demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
The authorities called the sum of the "golden parachut" of the Voronez Zamguernator
A one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of Voronez province, Yuri Aguillova, was made under the regional Public Officers Act.
The real amount of the “gold parachut” released from office was, however, somewhat lower than that of the media.
Such explanations were provided to the press service of the regional Government.
According to the law, the salary for the position of Agilova is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, in the press service, the lump sum payment was 223,892 roubles less 1 million roubles written by the media.
The official has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
His seniority in public office is over nine years.
The appointment of this pension and the lump sum payment are made immediately after his resignation and explained to RIA News in the Government of the Region.
At the same time, the payment of Agilovov ' s pension supplement has been suspended on appointment and his salary has not changed since the previous period.
The elected Governor of the region, Alexander Gussev, won the election on 15 September.
Agilova was dismissed from office on the expiration of the term of office of the Head of the Region.
Similarly, the powers of other government officials in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, Telegram, the Netigar Canal, published documents showing that Agilovova, who had resigned from his post as Vice Governor, had paid an termination allowance of 23 salaries, and that two days after that, he was again given a similar position without the addition of a Vrio.
Statelords called on students to tell them about the harm of masturbation.
Onshenko is the first Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
On the basis of his experience, he noted in an interview that youths were being masturbated by harmful information they find online.
This is being fought at the level of educational institutions and at the family level, and the deputy added.
Gennady Onishenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station Govorit Moscow):
As part of the overall sexual education of children, this must be done to explain the loss, for there is a risk of a child’s sexual health, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the growth of children is early enough, and there are further large scissors between their sexual maturity and the opportunity for official contact between the sexes.
In the view of Onishenko, the problem is being addressed by “hangues”, the silence of “sexual age” and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers face the effects of self - abuse.
Deputat believes that the first thing to do is to practice lessons about the harm of self-punism in the schools of the “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we'll just not be understood, to put it mildly," said the professor.

As a result of the tragedy, a number of vehicles fell under the asphalt, and two young people died locally from burns.
AG became the second most popular in Germany
The Anti-Migrant "Alternativa for Germany" is holding another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It appears that Germans have begun to become seriously tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which has made the country the target of millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most recent social issues suggest that the anti-immigrant party Alternatiwa for Germany is becoming more popular and that the position of the ruling block of Merkel and Zeehfer is becoming weaker.
This week, AG broke another record by stepping up the second line of the popular sympathy rating.
Right-wing conservatives with 17% popularity have been able to bypass social democracies with about 16%.
The gap in one percentage point can be written down as a statistical error, but one cannot help but note the fact that AG, created in 2013 from a small group of Euroskeptic economists, has been transformed into a major political force.
General leadership has, for the time being, continued to retain the ruling C currently/CDF block, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards losing points - as early as April, support for Angela Merkel's block was four percentage points higher.
The German chancellor ' s personal rating, which is headed by the German Government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, 7 percent less than last year.
In addition, the social democracies were followed by greens (15%), leftovers (11%) and liberals (10%).
Evolution of the Alternatives
The “Alternativa for Germany” was established in September 2012 on the basis of an “Alternative Choice 2013” group that included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the Government's course, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
In doing so, the group opposed Germany's “subsistence” of weak EU economies, but did not preclude the possibility of returning to the mark of Germany and leaving the European Union entirely.
In the face of the deepening immigration crisis, the ANG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the team was formed into a full-fledged party that had taken over the niche of Euroseptics and began to criticize the Government severely for failing immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary election, in 2017, ANG was able to enter the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the “Alternatives for Germany” received a seat in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens “a blasphemies”
The leader of the political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of the two books of Ostap Drozdov, on live air, admitted that he considered his compatriots to be “the existence of the turbans”.
They believe TV and don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We've never been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood," the journalist said.
Local nationalists quickly criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of not being patriotic and greedy.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio had begun to combat literature, which contained the slightest hint of criticism by the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the import of as much as 201 publications.
Manchester City won Brighton and joined APL leaders.

Canadians set up a car in the event of the Apocalypse magazine driving
A car can be bought by anyone who wants it.
Rochael Defence Solutions stated that it was already accepting applications for its new armor.
Abronivoir of the Apocalypse of Roschel Senator APC
It's not just video-players, film studios and book publishing that make money on the subject of the Apocalypse.
Now the new niche is being developed by automobile companies.
For example, the Canadian Rosel Definition Solutions presented its armored Apocalypse Senator APC.
The engineers of this company set up armoured vehicles for the police in a dream free of charge.
Rosel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who, without special comfort but in full safety, are placed in a fully-carried armoured personnelupule.
This bunker, or you can't name it, because its reservation level is B7, is set on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Douty pick-up truck.
Its front, also armoured, is capable of protecting the capsule from grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Rockel Senator APC APC armorage
To prevent passengers from even being affected by an explosive wave from breaking up near a car projectile, the car is equipped with special shock chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
For safe vision, a motor vehicle, Rosel Senator APC, is equipped with a circular camera with a night vision function as well as an armoured view tower on the roof.
There's no weapon in the car.
Front of the armored apocalyptic salon, Rosel Senator APC
To ensure that the weight of the armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility, Rosel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbodies engine of 6.7 l, the whole power of which is transmitted to four wheels of the armor through a 6-step automatic gearbox.
There's no chance of getting caught up in Rochel Senator APC's armory.
You can see Rosel Senator APC's armory at a special exhibition in Washington, D.C., in October.
The term of death of the universe
The universe lasts about 140 billion years, 10 times the age of the observed world, which is about 13.8 billion years.
The study of an international team of scientists has been published in the e-preservatives library arXiv.org and is being published in the magazine Publications of the Astronomy Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts have come to this conclusion by observing, with the help of HSC’s camera Superme-Cam, the Subaru telescope for some ten million galaxies.
After tracking the distribution of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, which accounted for more than 95 per cent of the world ' s energy mass, scientists, working in a standard cosmological model of the CDM, estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
The press release of the Subaru Observatory noted that observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the recording of the data of the Planck European Space Telescope clarified the limitations imposed on the CDM parameters.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments for the observed world to cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Divide.
There has been a breakdown in the regular attempt to unify the initiators of the pension referendum
The opportunity to learn people's views on pension reform is delayed indefinitely
In Moscow, there was a meeting of the federal initiative group of the referendum against the promotion of retirement age on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that recorded the different language of the issues (the total of five were registered by the Centre).
They decided to apply to the CEC for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians: "Do you wish to ensure that the age at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension as of 1 July 2018 does not increase?"
The wording was registered by a Voloda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the congregation, but it was considered to be the simplest and legal weight.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of Ilya Sviridov's Fair Russia (six subgroups) and CPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronage and Orenburg.
Sviridov used to say "Kids" that invitations had been sent to all initiators and that representatives of some 40 subgroups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenov, the leader of the Voloda subgroup (which was supported by another 15 sub-groups), said, "Knowledges," that the invitations were not received and did not plan to come: "We didn't understand who the friend is and who the enemy is."
Otis Rush, a blue singer, died.
At the age of 84, Otis Rush, a well-known blue guitarist and singer, died with reference to his manager, Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following the 2003 stroke.
Mr. Rash's creation had an impact on musicians like Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.
He was well-known in 1956 after the release of the song "I Can't Quit You Baby", which took the sixth line of the Billboard R&B rating.
"Admiral" has created big problems for us
Zinetula Belleletdinov: "Admiral" has created great problems for us.
Chief coach, Aq Barsa, Zeinethula Bilaletdin, summarized the regular CK championship match against Admiral (4:2).
"A difficult game was complicated.
The rival fought with dignity, created big problems for us.
I'm glad we played pretty well today.
I've already told you that one day the bares will come, and that's all we need to do is work on it.
And that we won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zarip a break in this series?"
"We have our own program for which he works.
That's why that was the decision," he says.
Ilon Musk will leave the post of Chief of the Tesla Board of Directors
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk would have to resign from the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the position of executive director of the company, reports AFP with reference to the regulator ' s data.
Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Previously, the regulator filed a claim against Ilon Mack, the officials believed that he had misled the Tesla investors, since a businessman had allowed the purchase of all the shares of the company at a high price of $420 per paper.
In Loko's "Ahmat" match, Turbin's mistakes were like a horn full of plenty.
Former All-Inclusive Judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of arbitrator Eugenius Turbin in the 9th tour of the Russian championship Locomotive, Ahmat, and dealt with the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you judge Evgenia Turbin at Locomotive's "Ahmat"?
- I think this arbitrator has confirmed that he is not fit to be tried by a Russian premier League match.
I'm surprised that the insistents of the Spartacus fifth round of the Spartacus, the Dinamo, neither Turbin himself nor the leaders of the DSI, have come to serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result was no delay in the ninth round: errors in his actions, and private blanks of harsh receptions were piled up as a horn of plenty.
For example, for the 50th minute of Eder's railways, he's putting his hands in his punishment area for the "Ahmat" of Rodolfo.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put the toolbar on it.
- How do you rate the episode involving Ida, who was at the 82nd minute when it appeared that the ball was in his hand?
- I think there was a deliberate play here by the defense lawyer's hand in his prison square.
Turbin was close to the moment, well-seeing the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment was to be seen by Judge Sergei Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three were asleep, and the toolbar was not assigned.
The score in the match was therefore distorted, and sports justice was damaged.
This was the very case where the judicial process was supposed to have pushed out and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
At 52 minutes, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's lawyer, who broke the rules in the fight against Krykhovak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he gave him a demonstrative applause.
What do you think of this episode?
You should've shown the second mustard?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card didn't really show up.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match that there were double standards of justice that some teams had been pitched for violations such as the Ida episode and none of them.
What do you appreciate about the football player's words?
- I don't know what to mean by double standards.
There was a toolbar.
They didn't.
So, the arbitrator won't let the second toolbar in the opposite gate.
Here's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge looks who's playing.
Here's the "Locomotive" on Saturday and the "Ahmat" has a serious claim to the work of Turbin because the team was disabled.
Matt Damon played the rape defendant Judge Cavanaugh at the SNL launch.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new season of the Sunday Night Live on the NBC TV channel.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavanano at a Senate hearing on charges of rape.
The candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotions and details during a discussion with Senator Amy Clobuchar.
For example, Cavanaugh repeatedly admitted to his love for beer, but said that he had never been drunk before.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavano claimed to have been a virgin during those years.
Damon also played these points.
All I did was make a lot of drink and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the most proud, drunk virgin I've ever seen.
Everyone knows it," the judge said in the execution of Matt Damon.
Cavanaugh had previously been elected U.S. Supreme Justice.
Barbra Stracend discovered strange behavior from his cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streizand claimed that the clones of her dead dog were different from the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
"It's not possible to clone a soul," said a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Straysand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old dog, the koton detulear named Samantha, who had to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, who was the world's smallest dog, was cloned 49 times.
Experts are working on the cloning of a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so small.
U.S.A. thought about the Russian sea blockade because of oil and gas supplies
In the U.S., a sea blockade may begin to take advantage of the world energy market.
The American authorities are so busy fighting for success in the world hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the Russian sea blockade, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
Ryan Zinke, head of the United States Ministry of Internal Affairs, described the possibility of a naval blockade the previous day.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior does civilian functions rather than police, including natural resources policy.
Thus, Zinke’s statement came within the competence of his department, although it was not devoid of political prominence.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that, thanks to the U.S. Navy, maritime routes in the Middle East region could be blocked and blocked if necessary.
Zinke's words suggested that the need could be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supply to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continued to receive a large share of its revenues from the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motivation for the revitalization of Moscow in the region, Zinke is confident.
The Minister made it clear that the US continues to look forward to leading the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington will have to put Russia and Iran to rest, and the maritime blockade on trade routes is an acceptable measure in that direction, Zinke says.
The Kalmitz director received good feedback from the festival.
Our countryman, actor Eugenius Sangageev's "Gogoll Center" and his film "Harmony" are specifically mentioned in the Journal of the Sixth Debut Festival of the Movement, held in Omsk.
It is stated in the festival diploma that “this is a signal for the immediate response of the major industrial players of the film”.

There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former captain of Chelsea and congrudent England, John Terry, about why he went to the ninth round of the Spartacus, Spartacus.
"I've got a club in Russia that I'm watching.
I've been watching him lately and I was curious to see him from the outside.
I can't say that I am a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus, and I want to apologize again for the decision,” says Terry's Chelsea website.
Remember, the 18-point "Roost" rose to third place in the tournament table, and the Spartacus was placed on the fifth line, with 15 points on its asset.
The next round of red and white, on 7 October, will play with Enisey, and the Trusted Valery Karpina will be adopted by Orenburg a day earlier.
The expensive violin was placed in the Lombard for a priceless price.
When a man in Somerville, Massachusetts, brought a violin to the Loan who looked old and unreasonable.
But the experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and he sought advice from an expert.
It turned out that the violin was made by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinand Galiano in 1759 and is estimated at $250,000.
The violin fiddles alone are estimated to be between $16,000 and $18,000.
The investigation found that the violin had recently been stolen from a resident of the city, and the instrument had been returned to the rightful owner.
So far, it is not known how the violin came into contact with the person who put it in the Lombard, but there are no previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now all who bring the violin to the logo will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the customer.
In the ninth round of the RPF, we are faced with an exciting confrontation: Spartacus will host a "Roost" stadium in Tusin, under the leadership of Valery Karpin, a human being, as we know, not a foreign "people's team".
A special highlight of this meeting is that clubs now have an equal number of 15 points, and they divide three and four seats in the tournament table, falling behind the far-reaching Zenita, and standing in the same spot from the "Grannodar", which plays with "Dinamo" tomorrow.
Red and white now have a hard lane: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly flew into the Rapidou, and recently left the Akhmatu houses.
Following a derby with a fair nobody, Spartacus played the Black Sea Cup with a minimum score, and it is not easy to talk about whether Russia's most popular club is nearing its exit from the crisis.
"Rost" three games in a row couldn't win, but he doesn't know five games.
Let's see if Carpina can continue a win-win series with such a game of principle.
The previous meeting with Spartacus in Karpinov concluded in favour of the capital team.
It's 7 p.m.

London has been accused of Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, said British Defence Minister Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during the speech at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threat is increasing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, and enemies are operating in gray zones with cyberattacks and false news, the Minister added.
But the largest is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians in Moscow have repeatedly denied, and transmits, the TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunte, reported that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international regulations and use chemical weapons.
Hunt referred to a story of poisoning in the English city of Solsbury last March by an ex-creator of GRD, Sergei Scrippal, convicted of espionage in favor of the British, and his daughter, Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia holds a referendum for accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change of country name.

The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a major role in understanding.
This was the case on International Translator Day, 30 September, with a professional interpreter, Berbel Sackse.
It has been working in Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events calmly, and the Russians, as the saying goes, "they'll be slow and they're going fast."
But I don't think it's important to understand between peoples and to work as an interpreter," said the expert in the commentary "RIA News."
According to the interpreter, to understand that the two countries should not be without each other, “there is enough history to know”.
And in the future, Sacksa noted, there is no point in Germany ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, and there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny," she said.
The day before, German chancellor Angel Merkel stated that the country was trying to “link up” with and maintain Russia.
According to her, Berlin Mania was particularly important for the Northern Flow 2 gas pipeline, which was built from the Russian coast to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

A comedy called "The Night School" was headed by an American boxing officer.
"The Night School" comedy, debuting in American cinemas last Friday, earned $28 million for her first weekend in rental.

On the international market, so far only 20 countries have collected $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line, Malcolm Lee's work, which was remarkable enough to outpace another Western protégé, the "Smolfut" cartoon, the curious history of familiarity with a fascinating etiquette with a human being whose existence the main hero had never believed in.
The project of directors, Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reeseg, collected $23 million for their start-up weekend, generally meeting the expectations of experts who had predicted 20-25 million for the weekend.
With regard to Smolfuta's total fees, at present they amount to $38.6 million (with a debut already in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active in this area, adding 3.6 million to the film's treasury.
The three strongest children's story of "The Secret of the House With Clocks" is locked up by Ala Roth, who finally proved that the director was good at making good films and 12+ for the audience.
In her second week, John Bellers, with charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett, made $12.5 million on the screen, bringing the world's total fees to $53.8 million.

The back-off of Zakatia, after 24 days in American (and not only of course) cinemas, has $330 million in total earnings and has recently been proud of the most successful franchise film, which also includes two parts of Zaklaka itself and two tapes about Annabel's Beast doll.
Following the horrors of Corin Hardy, the last weekend was followed by another member of the genie, the Hellefest debutant, one of the main youth choreographers of the year.
In her first weekend, Gregory Plottkin, a well-known children's builder (and recently director) who had been working on a number of major projects, including "Happy Day of Death", where Hallefest was very similar, earned $5.1 million in U.S. revenue in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh was "The Unrich Asians" ($4.15 million), which does not seem to be expected to fall out of top 10 of the American boxing office: a romantic comedy that has been on screen for the seventh week, as a result of September, is the sixth in the list of the genie's most cashier tapes in history, with a record of 165.7 million.
This is the sum of the picture that has so far worked on the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.
With regard to the last three lucky men who fell into the 10th U.S. harvests of 28-30 September, they became Predator, White Rick and... "Bagra minta", who earned $3.7 million, 2.38 million and $1.1 million for the past weekend, respectively.
In addition, on the next weekend in the United States, we're going to gather the long-awaited "Ven" with Tom Hardy, who -- we can be sure -- will, without special difficulty, take over the leadership of the American Boxing Office as a result of the first weekend of October.
Of the other proms to come, it is worth highlighting a musical melodrama called "Star was born", a Venice film festival laureate from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hate."

Valery Belov: The Lord helped Siberia today.
Chief Co-Teamer Valery Belov, on the impact of Siberia (3:4) in the regular CKK championship match.
"Callega spoke of Siberian fans," and I want to mention our fans," says the words of the White Official Web site, "Vision."
"I hope they're going to support this, too, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, perhaps the Lord helped Siberia today, because he was very grossly wrong, especially our leaders.
We've lost the micro game, match 0:3 of our leading leaders, so it was hard for us to get this match out, even though there were moments.
But I'll do it anyway.
Because I must've missed something in preparation.
This was a different team than the previous match."
"It's a kind of roach."
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice at the Voice show.
The viewers of Voice 60+ accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "unlike grotesqueness and glamour."
When he heard his father’s voice from his first note, Nicholas Agutina, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the perpetrator.
But his son’s feelings took over, and he chose a relative as his team.
At that time, many thought it was a joke, but they excused the mentor’s bias in the first stage.
But the "shock" has been prolonged, and the father of the star has taken the place of the more worthy performers in absolute disrepute.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutina for this injustice.
Yesterday we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by the barrage of unseemly and frankly dragging our close relatives to the final staircase.
I've even doubted Agutin's strength and conscience to stop bringing his dad to the very first place," said Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin in "The TV Man."
In the meantime, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "saw" the great performers who were really singing, while Nicholas Petrović whispered a moving song about his mother, explaining that the viewers still want to see his father on the show.
But it turns out that it's not true that the viewers want an objective assessment and see in the finals really talented performers, and now Agutin discredits the show.
"I'm sorry for the Voices from Agutin's team, they were doomed."
"The last time Agutin showed how much he loved his dad, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and to leave in the project his dad, who's not singing but whispering, what can you then call a mentor?"
"I like the way Dad sings, organize a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people come to this concert."
It's a Voice show, not a Cool Relatives show.
"On the Agutin side, it was unprofessional."
"Then you have to offer your own show to give a talk to your dad, not to a show that's made for 1 Channel."
"That was a real chance for someone and he took a place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad has to make me understand more than any other participant with real ocular data.
Why was a working man from Surguth with a great voice and a timbre poured out, and Pope Agutin was brought to the finale?
And then we all complain that on stage and from screens the same faces for decades!
'Why, do not break through the bush.'
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
Blah and cuisine all around.
And the family budget will not be too much!
The theatre is still absurd!"
The users also recalled that in one of the season of the traditional Voices, the son of Gradsky was present at the blind auditions.
That's when the meter didn't come to mind to take your son to your own team.
And he said, "Come on, get out of here, understand everything."
Agutin couldn't act as a professional.
The Canadian military was allowed to wear beards to raise the spirits.
The Canadian Ministry of Defence issued an order allowing soldiers to wear beards.
According to the CBC television channel, the bill contains instructions on beard care.
It is noted that military personnel may be ordered to shave “for security reasons”.
The beard of the military cannot be longer than 2 cm, nor must it be carefully trimmed, and the neck and cheek should be shaved out.
At the same time, the fleet officials were allowed to wear a beard only on the ground.
It is expected that the innovation will “enforce morale in the army and attract more Canadians”.
The ban on wearing beards has been in force in the Canadian army since World War II.
Previously, it had been reported that police officers in France had also been allowed to wear beards and even to have tattoos.
At the same time, the Egyptian court supported the removal of bearded policemen.

Companies and officials will be punished if they do not transfer the house to the Single Housing Information System on time.
The innovation will help those who decide to buy an apartment in the building but who fear bankruptcy.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
As a result of the amendments to the law on equity construction, developers will have to lend their full credit to the bank.
And many experts have already talked about the likely heavy travel of apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.
In the centre of Kiev, the robber threatened the man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw the money from the ATM.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 September at Ivan Kudri Street, and the capital law enforcement officers reported.
According to the victim, an unknown man approached him and started a conversation, but then he suddenly grabbed a knife and demanded that the money and his cell phone be given him.
Since the victim did not have cash, the stranger ordered that the money be taken from the bank card.
After the attacker received 4,000 hryvnias and telephones, he hit the victim and fled,” says the report.
Law enforcement officers were able to arrest the robber and found themselves 25 years old.
He now faces up to seven years of imprisonment.
The police are also working on a version of the abuser's involvement in other such crimes.
Recall that the previous day in Odessa, there were a number of resonant raids by the incinerators.
In one case, armed robbers were caught using a drone.
The scientist described a possible scientific mission to the Moon by the Russian Federation.
The head of the Ran Institute for Space Research, correspondent member of Ran Anatoly Petruković, told RIA Novoty about a possible programme of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was now working on the direction of such work.
"No consolidated opinion yet," stressed the scholar.
He noted that one option was to place a low-pass radio telescope on the other side of the Moon, which would avoid interference with the Earth.
"It's the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," added Petruković.
He also believes that the moon could be used for tests of robotics, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be called upon to search for primitive organics on Earth’s satellite, a scientist says.
This could help determine how life is coming about on the planet.
The head of Roscosmos said earlier that in the optimistic version of the Russian Federation, a manned flight to the Moon could take place by 2030.
An offended client dropped out a basket of feces in a 7-Eleven store.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, called having a tooth at a 7-Eleven 24-hour network store manager: in May, he put him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
So he decided to avenge his enemy in the original way.
On the afternoon of the second night, he went into the store and dropped it on the floor and on some of the items on the shelf containing the contents of the basket he had brought.
The basket was filled with feces and urine, which Simms had “borrowed” from a nearby mobile biotoulet.
The police officers who arrived at the scene arrested the vigilante.
He was put in prison and released on bail at $300.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of property and a criminal offence and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms' crime seems more ridiculous than serious, the court's sentence may be quite harsh, as he has repeatedly violated the law: large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, driving in a state of ill-treatment and abuse of animals.
In the U.S., they named Russia’s most formidable submarine.
The most formidable enemy submarine for the U.S. Navy will be the Russian subterranean "Kazan" of the "January-M" project, writing The National Interest.
The submarine was launched in March 2017, but the Navy will receive it in 2019.
According to the publication, even Kazani's predecessor, Severodwinsk, was commended by the U.S. military.
We will face a severe potential enemy.
Just look at Severodwinsk, cited The National Interest Counter-Admiral Dave Johnson.
However, the publication writes that the United States retains its advantage over Russia in this industry.
The multi-purpose nuclear submarines “Kazan”, “Novosibirsk”, “Krasnoyarsk” and “Arkhangelsk” are built on an improved project “Jan-M” (885M).
They have 13 800 tonnes of water displacement, 520 metres of water depth, 64 crews, 100 days of self-sustainment, and 31 knots of underwater speed.
Submarine is armed with mines, torpedo 533 mm, Oneix and Caliber cruise missiles.
In August, the U.S. Navy 6 press service stated that the U.S. submarine forces remained “the most powerful and frightening on the planet”.
German politicians ignored the opening of the mosque because of Erdogan.

The ISA identified and detained the owner of the Peugeot-301, who had been travelling through the capital with the registration plates of the so-called “DDP” vehicle the previous day.
They were a former member of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, currently working as an agent of one of Ukraine ' s insurance companies.
According to the SBS press centre, the detainee explained that the vehicle had been wanted by INTERPOL since 2014 and was therefore detained on Russian territory and handed over to him as a representative of the insurance firm.
At the time of crossing the Ukrainian-Russian border, he removed the fair license plates, but he re-established them at the time of entry into Kiev.
He said that he had done so “in order to ensure the conformity of registration vehicle numbers of the package of documents for the vehicle in question issued by the Russian representatives of INTERPOL in case the vehicle was stopped for inspection by Ukrainian police”.
“A set of measures to verify the explanations provided as well as its possible involvement in terrorist activities are currently under way”, stated the ISS.
We note that in Ukraine the use of numbers issued by terrorists in the areas they have seized is prohibited.
In fact, a member of the State Border Service had been seen on a car with similar numbers in Mariupola earlier.

In the U.S., a possible maritime blockade of Russia was declared
The United States can, if necessary, impose a maritime blockade on Russia in order to prevent its supply of energy to the Middle East.
That was stated by Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of the Interior.
Speaking at an industrial event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of department stated that for the Russian economy the only source of income was the sale of energy and Moscow was actively pursuing oil and gas sales in the Middle East, as it did in Europe, writes Washington Examer.
Zinke also noted that this was the case with Iran.
In the view of the Minister, there are two options for its solution: the military and the economic.
He would prefer not to use the first one, so it was necessary to exert pressure and remove Iranian energy resources.

I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
Sergey Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
The Russian pilot Williams, Sergey Sirotkin, commented on the outcome of the Grand Primitive race.
I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I ended up between two cars that hit me right away.
I've lost all the positions I've played at the start, for a moment, right away.
Turned into a very bad position.
I'm stuck in traffic.
It was hoped that when the rest of us got to the pit stop, we would get into the clean air, and the pace would return, but there was no rubber.
Plus had a fight with his partner, too.
I understand he was a little wrong.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most unremitting track of the season, I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it any more," says Sirotkin RIA News.
Recall that Sirotkin, in a race on the Grand Primor of Russia, was finished in the 18th, and the British pilot "Mersedes" Lewis Hamilton became the winner.
Tarpisev described as absurd the removal of Gushukov and Pszcenko from the base of Spartacus.
The President of the Federation of Tennis of the Russian Federation (FTR), Shamel Tarpšchev, commented on the removal of Moscow Spartacus football players, Denis Gluchakova and Andrei Pscenko, from training with the main members after a speech to criticize the main coach of Massimo Carrera, reports Sport Weekend.
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
It's stupid to pay attention to things like this.
I completely disagree with what Carrera does.
It only deepens the division of the team.
First, it's poems, you can read them and take them for granted.
I wouldn't have reacted to this if I were Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to go for fun.
If Szczelukov and Pzczczczemko are slamming, it doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks flexibility in his perception of the situation.
And it doesn't serve a normal climate on the team.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so this situation didn't have to be crushed.
Maybe I should have laughed about it together.
Spartacus has much to do with the different lines, and there is no limit once it's introduced into young people.
The relationship within the team does not seem to add optimism to this match," Tarpishchev is certain.
The two teams will be held on 30 September and will start at 1900 Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously refused Spartacus, led a youth team called Chelsea.
Syriusa educators discussed natural technology with scientists
Teachers of the Syrius Educational Centre in Sochi, participants in the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the National Research Centre of the Curchatow Institute.
A presentation by researchers was made as part of the programme of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Environmentally Similar Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, on the website of the educational centre on 29 September.
The Lect opened a documentary entitled “Kody Kurchatovov”, during which the President of the Kurchatow Institute, a correspondent member of Ran Mikhail Kowalchuk, described global challenges as the driving force of civilization.
The scientist's lecture is published on Sirius.
School students have learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such quantities.
The environmental technologies that young scientists are working on today will help to solve this problem, according to the forum's organizers.
In addition, Kowalczuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of environmental technologies and also described the risks inherent in the creation of such technologies.
"The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a tremendous good.
It's an explosive increase in medical technology, it's a improvement in quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of natural technologies is in fact a technological reproduction of living systems.
There's a turning side, a deliberate intervention in human life.
There's always risks.
There was a car -- people were dying under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology is immediate.
I'm creating a new medical technology, and I can build weapons of mass destruction," quotes a scientist named Ren TV.
After watching the film and discussing the current scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions from the meeting.
Speakers were the Physico-Mathematics candidate, the head of the Kurchatow NBICS-Natural Technology Project of NIC Curchatow Institute, Julia Djakova, and the head of the Kurchatow NBICS-Technology Kurchatov complex of Vyacheslav Demin.
The Syrius Educational Center in Sochi has been established by the Talant and Success Education Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure, at the initiative of President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
The purpose of the educational centre is to identify, develop and further provide professional support to gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that all-Russian online-Olympiad for information security information, Cyberviso, would be sent to Sirius for training.
An air traffic controller saved a plane with passengers during an earthquake in Indonesia
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller, Antonius Gunawan Agung, saved hundreds of Batik Air passengers at a cost.

When he fell, he suffered serious internal injuries, and doctors were unable to save him.
Kazan Russian subterranean scared the United States
The biggest threat to the U.S. Navy is the Russian submarine Kazan.
That's what American counter-admiral Dave Johnson said, transmitting "Rosbolt" with reference to The National Interest.
"We are threatened by a severe potential enemy.
Just look at Severodwinsk," he said, pointing to Kazani's predecessor model.
According to the U.S. Navy Commander-in-Office in Europe, James Foggo, Russia has focused its efforts on the modernization of its submarine fleet.
Macedonia: referendum did not take place due to low appearance
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country as “North Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the use by the Macedonians of the name of their historic province.
The change of name led the former Yugoslav Republic of Korea to open the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the EFE agency, only 34% of the "not reached" on Sunday's plebiscite to a constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative in nature, the authorities in Skopje might decide not to refuse to be renamed.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, a supporter of the change of the name of the Republic, stated that if there were more “yes” among the votes cast, Macedonia would change the name in spite of an unreached quorum.

Kemerachants Disguised the flock of rams in the cemetery
On 30 September, an eyewitness reported on the social network of a well-known Kemeros page that cattle were walking freely on one of the local cemeterys.
The animals of a large herd walked between the fences and dug the grass.
The commentators expressed differing views: one of the local residents noted that in the presence of small cattle at the cemetery, there was no harm and their appetite could even help clear the area from weeds and grasses, but some of the inhabitants of the city did not have to take pleasure in the behaviour of the animals:
"This is a graveyard, not a pasture.
There's nothing to be done for the rams.
Of the rams, of course you will not say that they have gone astray, but that is not the case."
In one way or another, one of the eyewitnesses said that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery was already known, and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
- What's the right thing to do?
There's no word of pressure.
That's right.
The word “longing” in the meaning of “tow, to influence, to influence” only exists phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word “to satisfy”.
We're using that word in the belief that it comes from the word pressure.
But pressure and satisfaction are not only close, but even in some sense the opposite.
See for yourself.
To owe (church-book, obsolete) means " Enough, enough, enough for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
Enjoy, enjoy, family words.
Previously, he still had the meaning of “not dependent on anything to be self-satisfied” — “to be satisfied”.
The ancient Slavic word "loyal" is similar to the word "lord" and "voluntary."
The pressure, the repression, is quite different.
These words have truly frightening “descendants”: daos - “volts”, deyja - “dying” and dvaidā - “to oppress”.
The similar phonetic nature of the words “pression” and “reap”, as well as the imminent ageing of the latter, caused them to enter the mine.
That's how we came to have the same "d" as the letter uses through the "a", which is, in a good way, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of those words.
So, right, let's do it.
But the word is outdated, in its correct meaning no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative effect on you from above, use the word “press”.
It's also possible to use the "force pressure," but remember, it's an office.

Our car is much slower than Mercedes.
The Ferrari pilot Kimy Ryckonen was about the qualifications of the Grand Priy of Russia, which led to his taking fourth place.
"Kimee, did you have a chance today to fight for a bullet?
How well did the car behave?"

But the behavior of our car has been the best since the beginning of the weekend."
"You didn't step into Sebastian Fettel's speed in the course of your qualifications, but eventually the backlog was visible.
What's the reason?"
"My attempt was good, but then one of the Mercedes racers came forward.
He was getting ready for the attempt, and he was able to miss me, but I think I lost it for a while.
But it doesn't really have a big impact on the outcome."
"In Sochi, it's very hard to get past it, the race is going to be the key thing?"
"Maybe, yes, but you never know how it's going to work.
It's not going to be easy anyway, because our car is much slower than Mercedes."

Miracles do happen in our lives!
One of them was told by a German journalist, Christie Ditz, on Twitter.
She wrote on her page that her four-year-old son had been parking his bobel (a child-free bicycle) around the same lamppost throughout the year.
And one morning, a nice green bike sticker came up on the column and said, "Only for him."
There was no limit to my mother and baby's admiration.
Christy thanked the anonymous kindly and commended him for his interesting and fresh idea.

"How wonderful!"
"Thanks for the wonderful association in this world."
I think there's a lot of people in the world who can do that."
"Unfortunately, they don't attract the same attention as the outcasts."
"This is the world we need."
The readers asked the journalist if she could find out who the author of the idea was.
This man seems to be somewhere near him: he's been watching the kid park since that's what's in his mind.

Russia has shielded itself from terrorists by means of an operation in Syria
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 had been destroyed by the Aerospace and Space Forces of the Russian Federation.
This was described in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the FAC, Victor Bondarev, head of the Federation Defence and Security Council Committee.
He noted the high accuracy with regard to the use of air-to-air means of impact: the Aerospace Forces had carried out and continued to strike precisely at terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist targets have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition warehouses, reinforcements and headquarters.
Russian air strikes were used to hack the Jihadists' defenses, making a decisive contribution to the progress of the Syrian Government's troops, transmitting the Interfax.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, our military operation in Syria has allowed Russia to be shielded from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IH, banned in Russia) and Jebhat en Nousru (prohibited in Russia).
According to Genstab of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, some 4,000 Russian militants and about 5,000 citizens of post-Soviet countries were fighting on the IG side, passing over TAS.
And it is only a registered person, except for those who were not identified, that Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter freely into our country.
So, said Bondarev, in Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism on far-reaching points - otherwise this evil would “clap towards us”.

Syria accused the United States of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Mualem, accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and of supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian town of Rakka and destroyed the infrastructure and public services in the areas targeted, killing civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes,” he said.
According to Mualham, the United States and its partners have provided “direct support to the terrorists”, as the targets of the militants and the Western Coalition in Syria coincided and implied “the sowing of chaos, death and destruction in their path”.
The Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria had almost been completed and the country had become safer and more stable.
Mualem added that Damascus also intended to clear Syria of an illegal foreign presence and that priority would be given to Syrian partners in rebuilding the country.

Protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” said Prossenko.
As President, he said, he would protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they were, in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a passport scandal with Hungary, which is intended to expel the Consul of that country from Beregovo.
"I fully share every letter that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says," said the President.
On 19 September, a video showing the time of issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in the Hungarian Consulate in Bergovo was published on the Internet.

More than 10 million Syrians have been refugees since the outbreak of the armed conflict in Syria for seven years.
Some five million people fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Damascus now believes that the hostilities are nearing completion and the country is ready to return refugees voluntarily.

The Government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions had been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country which they had had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which had made life and livelihood difficult for people.

Mitropolitus Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename UPC to Fascist actions
The head of the Russian Orthodox Church's Division of External Relations, Mitropolitan Ilarion, compared the designation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
"It's like in German Fascist Germany to stick a yellow vertice star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it's for this purpose that this bill was created," declared a mitropolitan on the TV channel "Russia 24" (Interfax Cit).
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainen conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev therefore hopes to gain full control over the UCP and to “outlaw it” the clergyman believes.
"It is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of that church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country," he added.
It had been reported earlier that the members of the Supreme Council were working on the implementation of Bills Nos. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the change to the name of the SCP of the Moscow patriarchate.
The Deputy of Pochaevsky Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Mitropolitan Vladimir, Deputy of the Saint-Uspen Pochaev laura, called for the protection of Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UCC) was published on Saturday on the website.
At various times in history, our predecessors and relatives in faith and spirit had to exercise their faith and defend their holy places.
In view of the situation and the information that we have and the threats of the massacres that are spreading, it is clear that we too will have to survive," Mitropolitan stated.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
Also, the incumbent of the laurel stressed that “your physical presence is likely to be needed”.
The priest added, "Lenin's grandchildren are by spirit, and they threaten to kill us, and then we defend our sanctuary."
Those who care about the fate of Pochaev’s laurel, an Orthodox sanctuary in Ukraine and a universal sanctuary, should be prepared to protect it, says the address.
Mithropolitus urged against those who mislead the believers.
The OCC has the canonical status defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to make it dependent on the news patriarch and friend of the Catholic pope of Roman Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is unacceptable to us.
And we're happy with the status our church has," the deputy of the laurel.
He recalled that the UCP has been completely independent and fully independent in its management since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos has our church already.
"What else do we need?" said Mitropolitan Pochaevsky Vladimir, urging believers and all citizens to ask whether other Tomos faiths have any other faiths, are they independent of the Vatican?
The believers had some insight and some determination as to what kind of temple they would go to.
But some people want to sow hostility and strife again.
Some become envious that they shine the domes on the temples they want to destroy,” the priest said.
The Pediavian laurel is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurel is located at the top of the Mount of Pochaev, 70 kilometres from Ternopol.
The first historical record of it dates back to the early 13th century.

"The good game was, interesting though it was going to the ground," Vorobiev said, "the official website of "The Carlobilist."
"They tried to play very easily.
The first period was very good.
We haven't used some good points.
During the second period, the rival gave us some cremation, and we endured.
But we've been fed a little bit.
They played great, they did coaching.
I think if we continue to play the right game, we'll win.
They didn't win the game, they didn't win the game's head with zero, but the content of the game was the right one.
Good luck will come if we continue to play in this direction.”

"Then no foreign link was played.
In the pre-session, teams were doing other tasks, and many young people were playing.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey.
"The motorist" is a good team.
It's clear from the tournament table that the team is playing right.
Good hockey, good atmosphere in both the arena and the city.
You can only wish them luck.
The team moves in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good raffle.
It was hard, we were preparing.
We knew the team was coming unscathed, and we wanted to break it, but it didn't work."

Chief Macedonian opposition refused to vote in the referendum
In Macedonia, a referendum on the intergovernmental treaty with Greece to rename the Republic of Macedonia is held on Sunday, 30 September.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?”
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, the Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (WMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mizkoi stated that there would be no vote in the referendum.
As the Spokesperson of the Party, Nahum Stoilkowski, explained, Mitzkoi decided to abstain from voting in order to express his opposition to a treaty that is considered “hazardous”.
According to the Spokesperson, the current referendum addresses the issue of the country ' s name and no more than the Party ' s strategic goal of achieving NATO and EU membership.
A week ago, President George Ivanov of Macedonia also refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considered the country ' s name to be a negative factor.

The treaty should resolve a multi-year dispute over the name of the country, as well as the route to NATO and the EU, recalled the TASC.

United States of America is in the process of increasing the production of opiates in Afghanistan
The dramatic deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September was much talked about in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations involving China, Iran, India, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nicolai Patrusev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, militants have waged a genuine terrorist war against the authorities of the State and the peaceful population of the country.
This year has become the record number of bloody attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” said Patrusev.
The troubles of Afghanistan did not start yesterday.
Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the main enemy of the United States was the Al-Qaida terrorist group (prohibited in the Russian Federation) who settled in Afghanistan.
Within a month, America and NATO allies launched a military operation called Enduring Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
A thousand-year-old United States contingent is still on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
The U.S. troops have been driven to take dozens of their bases.
If they can, they'll be paid off of the fighters for money, but they won't be touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40 per cent, according to Patruzev.
50% is in the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
An additional 10% is for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they grow there quickly.
The aim is to create a barbarous pseudo-halfate in Central Asia - exactly what they failed to do in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be doing well.
It is also encouraging that drug production (opiats) in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times over the 17 years of the United States presence.
The huge growth of the area sown with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.
The Macedonians are preparing to vote in the referendum for accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change of country name.
An agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia, as it saw the attempt against the same Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkowski, a political scientist: “By means of this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia is entitled to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will establish the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot bring happiness to everyone.”
The name of the country is adopted by the ruling social democracies, headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
The opposition is the conservative opposition and the President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Quettin Chilemanov, Macedonia has no point in entering the EU - it is sufficient to have a partnership with it: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist Government, led by Zaev, is imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, I will lose my sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that would not like Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the greatest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine not only the future of the Balkans but also Europe as a whole.”
