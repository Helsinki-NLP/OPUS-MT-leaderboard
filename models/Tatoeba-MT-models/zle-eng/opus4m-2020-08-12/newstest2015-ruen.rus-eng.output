The FANO of Russia will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) will jointly organize the third Expert Session “Assessment of the Effectiveness of the Activities of Scientific Organizations” with the RRA.
The meeting will become the final part of the Agency's series of meetings during the year, as reported in a press release from Lenta.Ru.
The third meeting planned to take stock of the results of the Expert Session in the year and to produce a final list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
The participants are planning to discuss the rules for the establishment of expert groups responsible for the assessment of the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will conclude with a series of events aimed at developing a common approach for all three academies in the assessment of the performance of scientific organizations.
We have been able to do this over the past five months, and the final version of the normative documents is in agreement.
As a result of the next session, we must finalize the science-based and expert analysis processes, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment,” said Helen Axenov, director of the Russian Federation's FANO Analysis and Analysis Office.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred Russian scientific institutions.
Following that, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at Moscow City, Solianca Street, Home 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect the birth stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied the disturbing confusion and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow for the discovery of similar stars, that is, derived from one cluster.
The results of their studies were published in Nature magazine and are briefly available on the university website.
The same chemical composition of the nearest stars is due to the disturbing mixing of gas in the clouds prior to the formation of the stars.
Even if a born star then leaves a star cluster, its chemical composition can determine its birthplace and region of origin.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of the star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
Astrophysics simulation results show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, specialists using a supercomputer simulated two streams of interstellar gas that together formed clouds.
This object is transformed into a cluster within a few million years under its own gravity, where proto-stars begin to form.
Scientists added color labels to the original gas streams and found that rapid confusion in the cloud was achieving a high degree of chemical uniformity.
Astrophysicists believe that their research proves that it is possible to search for chemically based stars and to identify possible regions for the formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrested 20 years after a high speed motorcycle was chased
The motorcycle was confiscated after being driven 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through the Bushland to escape police in Pilbar.
A transport police patrol in Carrat this morning tried to stop the blue motorcycle, finding that it was at 125 km/h when it left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police report that the rider did not stop and continued his movement on Burgess Road, then turned him over to Bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
A motorcycle and a person described by the driver were seen near the house on Walcott Way in Bulgar.
Carrata police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and driving dangerously.

Lavrov: Russia will not “knob the door” for new sanctions and will not withdraw from WTO
Russia will not “knob the door” in connection with the new sanctions.
This was stated today by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, speaking before students and teachers of the MGIMO.
With regard to our response to a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything should be specifically calculated,' he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will like this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be related to the hobbling of doors, some kind of insult, misinterpreted, the Minister stressed.
We will, first of all, turn our backs on our interests, our interests in protecting our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners for their adequacy, coherence and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions can be very well judged by the partners, as continued by the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
If it's all said, "they're gonna hurt us too, but we have to do it to punish Russia," that's probably not good enough."
With regard to WTO, the Russian Federation was not responding to possible new sanctions.
On the contrary, we want to learn more about WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes, said Lavrov.
We have already used this tool to overcome what we consider to be a discriminatory EU policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping and anti-dumping measures are used against the sectors of the Russian economy.
“We are ready to use WTO mechanisms and to defend our position that the third EU energy package should not be applied retrospectively,” said Lavrov.
How can we use sirens in the design of the garden?
Irina Okuneva answers:
Since sirens lose their primary appeal after blooming, it is desirable to plant them along with other shrubs.
It is beautifully combined with many cultures.
It is also possible and necessary to plant plants that are decorative at other times and that are also flowering at the same time.
Another plus of the siren is that it provides a lot of creative opportunities.
You can form it into a stub tree of different heights, an improved bush, a wide - base bush, or even a garden bonsai tree with a curiously curved barrel.
Just pick the shape that fits your garden design more closely.
In Carelia, a Leningrad resident was convicted of selling counterfeit money
According to the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, a man was engaged in his own criminal activities in Olonetsk and Ségezh district.
In addition to Karélia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has been able to inherit the Volodol region, where he was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment in the spring of this year.
Later, the man appeared before the Holonet District Court.
In order to complete the investigation into the crimes committed in our Republic, they were staged in Ségeja.
In the course of the investigation, several episodes of counterfeit money relating to the summer of 2013 were proved guilty.
At the end of June of this year, the criminal case file with the indictment was referred to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court decided to replace the term of imprisonment for four years with the term of service in a general regime colony.
The sentence has not entered into force.
Recall that during the past week, two other counterfeiters were convicted of having been paid for them at Petrozadsk shops.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Kareliya from St. Petersburg.
One is deprived of liberty for five years, the other for four years.
Each was fined 500,000 roubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
In Archangelsk, we celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Derwish".
A rally held at the regional center was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Derwish delivered military assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
In Archangelsk, a memorial meeting was held in a monument to a future monument to the northern convoys, which is located on the coast name of Sedov in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of Veterans' organizations, Archangelska, children of the Edith class.
For the first time, we met twenty-three years ago when a stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those whom the sea did not return," said the chairman of the North Sea Park Veterans Council, Boris Carp.
Then, at the event, the city’s orchestra performed, and the teachers of the Edith classes gave the veterans flowers and marched with the Russian flags and the victory sign.
The rally ended with the putting of flowers on the bedstone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped boots, tin, wool and many other equipment and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were also on board: 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Harrikin fighter aircraft, in disassembled condition.
At the same time, the escort was made up of 16 British Navy ships, including two aircraftmen.
The caravan of the ships was not found by the enemy and has reached the point of destination, Archangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 vehicles and about 50 warships were killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis proposed a bill on which trade union organizations are protected as civil law.
"Where trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, democracy from Minnesota, who is co-chair of the Congress of the Progressive Faction.
That's why I'm proud to present the Employee Empowerment Act along with the civil rights movement symbol John Lewis.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade union organizations as other forms of discrimination by halting the forces of opponents of trade unions.
The amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to enable workers facing discrimination for participation in trade union organizations to seek justice before civil courts, and to receive compensation for damages and fines, a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis and the co-sponsors of the bill are to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks by trade unions in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding and respecting labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans remember when that country was at the same time defending democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that Hideki Todzie's paramilitary autocracy had been replaced by democracy.
While fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in forming a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his associates helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler had been replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and to every profession or activity.
Agreements which restrict or seek to undermine this right will not have legal effect; measures to that effect will be considered illegal.
When former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which produced the World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948 would be adopted by the United Nations as a world agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions for the sake of his own interests”.
For generations, Americans have adopted as a valid basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions — and that the trade union should participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government institutions — should be protected.
At a time when those rights are being attacked in America, it is indeed wise to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the power of the nation, but has increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions have miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers the way it should be.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are reviving ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge temporarily blocks a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the implementation of the Louisiana Act on Sunday, which his supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Louisiana Bobby Ginadle in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who perform abortions would have to have the authority to receive patients from a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
Nevertheless, a judge ' s decision meant that doctors could still carry out legal abortions by continuing to seek such powers.
“The plaintiffs will be permitted to work legally for the continuation of their powers”, wrote Judge John DeGrewells in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month when the judge will render a more permanent decision on the law.
The defenders of the right to abortion were pleased to see this decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
“The present-day decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from a treacherous law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights”, said Nancy Nortap, President and Head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a motion to suspend the law from the face of three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who had not been applicants in the case and also applied for admission authority.
Louisiana is located in 11 states that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on admission powers impose restrictions on doctors not necessary for medical purposes.
Opposers to abortion object that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effects on the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who has abortions in Louisiana has a hospital admission authority, reported to the Reproductive Rights Centre.
If all the rest of the medical staff in the state were to stop doing this procedure, the doctor would, for fear of his safety, stop carrying out the procedure, as reported by the team.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for decision-making power were pending.
The introduction of quotas for domestic products will result in what
At least half of the products for each type of product in the trade chain should be Russian production, according to Olga Nile, deputy of the State Party of Fair Russia.
The parliamentarian has drafted a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writing the newspaper Izvedia.
The document will be detailed to avoid possible discomfort to the buyers.
This applies to products not produced in Russia. "> For the rest of the product groups produced in Russia, the Riteler will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers," reported Neil to the publication.
Together with amendments to the article “On the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation”, the bill provides for the amendment of the Tax Code, which establishes a reduction of 10 per cent for products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is part of a stimulus package for Russian producers.
A few times as many domestic products will be available at the counters.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to an attorney for Natlovik, a member of the Public Duma Independent Expert Centre, Sergei Litwinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
They're going to be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means the profits will grow.
They will also have the right to dictate their terms and prices to the Ritellers, as they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, resulting in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenue, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some more rapidly, contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will be reduced by a few times, but not immediately,” the expert notes.
Russia ' s enterprises had often been unable to break through local store counters because of the high competition of foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been released and can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that, after all the necessary agreements and health checks, the Russian market will receive food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.
In other words, it's now "the moment of silence" when the old players are gone and the new ones are not here.
Almost a month later, we can talk about increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products,” said AIF.ru, First Vice-President of Russia-wide public organization “The Russian Financial Directors' Club”, C.E. Tamara Kasyanova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category would make it possible to consolidate the sector to local producers.
In such a case, they will compete with each other rather than with products that are cheaper through subsidies from another State.
In other words, the buyer will be fought between companies operating under the same industry laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of their compatriots in many ways.
In this situation, trade networks will have to “strip up” the share of Russian products to half the range.
There is thus growing fear that poor goods will be placed on the counters.
Perhaps foreign products with broken labels will be produced in Russia,” adds the expert.
The negative impact of quotas will be felt by major trading networks, especially those that benefit from cooperation with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by this arrangement, as demand for their products will decline.
Litwinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods can affect consumers as well.
The point is that some Russian products may be inferior in quality to imported analogies, while shops may be able to raise prices for second products as scarce goods.
The idea of importing economics in the early 2000s was once again raised by economists in February of this year due to the continued devaluation of the ruble.
In the face of difficult relations with the West, the issue of non-importing of imported products is becoming even more urgent.
The law is intended to require reitlers, when ordering suppliers, to consider with domestic producers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the way to import, and a system of product planning will be established in a shorter time frame,” says Deputy Oleg Neil.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are truly capable of fully covering Russian shops.
In addition, meat production can generate strong momentum.
It is known that the largest share of imports remains for beef, from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It turns out 65-70% are Russian products," Kasyanova says.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas on domestic products will facilitate import substitution and may accelerate this process.
However, this initiative does not in itself lead to import displacement, as it requires a set of measures, and is confident that Lithuania will do so.
In any event, 50 per cent of the goods sold under the initiative could still be imported from abroad, and thus no full import would take place, but significant steps would be taken in that direction.
Moreover, quotas were not enough, and domestic production was still needed in order to meet those quotas.
The quota will provide such guarantees,” notes the expert.
Early diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Rural women in Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than urban women.
Researchers analysed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after the diagnosis was made.
The leading researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute of Medical Research, QIMR Berghofer, reported that the likelihood of dying in the study was 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote states than for those living in urban areas.
RESEARCH: New drugs can slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers have followed the medical path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the existence of current diseases and socio-economic status also had an impact on the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancers at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote states, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecological oncology, and they're mostly in large cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would allow women to be treated closer to the home and programmes to support people receiving treatment away from their home might help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that long life expectancy for women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tino Rede to Conquer sectionr will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank, Elise Nev, said that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
The new FAA will open the door in the Kugener area in September.
The construction of a health facility in the village of Tokaibelac was initiated in April this year and was carried out on a model project.
The cost of work was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Office of Public Relations and Information, Head Mary El, the funding for the construction of the facility was financed by the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the facility is almost 230 square metres.
This will provide health care to the population of eight settlements: Tokybelak and Dementievo, Puncherumal, Tunja, Fomichi, Toraybelak, Shinar and Chascal.
The new health centre will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and which has long been exhausted and whose premises do not meet the sanitary requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
A dead four-month-old son in a state of acute re-suscitation will be brought to justice
A woman living in Chuwasa will be on the dock for killing her own child.
In Cheboxarah, the criminal investigation of a 31-year-old woman, Novacheboksarsk, accused of causing death by recklessness, was completed.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year the accused, together with the four-month-old son, arrived to celebrate the birthday of the child of their kuma in Cheboxar.
After a long pause, the newcomer decided to stay in the house and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, the impregnated woman put him next to her bed to feed her breast but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman attacked her son and died of suffocation.
The criminal case, as reported by the S.S.S.A.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.A.S.A.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.A.S.P.A.C. for Chuwasa, is referred to the court.
Inflation's out of leave.
Are Russians experiencing a sharp rise in prices
As a result of the cross-border sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and fail to meet the expectations of the authorities and are convinced by BTB Capital analysts.
According to experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions would lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, says RBC Daily.
According to the latest Mineconomy forecast, inflation will be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014 and less than 6.5 per cent next year.
However, according to the Commersant newspaper, this week the IRE should make “small but fundamental” adjustments to the macroeconomic outlook by 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could reduce inflation estimates for 2015, which would eliminate the expected underdevelopment of the incomes of the population.
The projection was that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation were in effect for a year, until August 2015.
How could such a situation suggest such high inflation?
The current situation is a one-off shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change,” said a source of the newspaper in Minffina.
Economists from WTB Capital do not share the Government's expectations for inflation and predict price increases of 8 per cent in 2014.
The main effect of the product bans will be, together with the possible introduction of a sales tax (SN tax) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, convinced experts.
The 9 per cent inflation peak will be February, followed by a decline in annual price increases, by experts.
By the way, last week Rosstat summarized the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed “cautious sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed experts and clarified their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the CC AForex Analysis Department:
Price increases are already taking place in the main segments of the product.
Moreover, when socially significant products were valued, the Government was forced to initiate systematic price stability monitoring measures to prevent the risk of undue price increases in the short term.
Vendors and Ritellers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and why the price increases are initiated.
The major factors contributing to the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the tremendous rate of capital outflow, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-guarantor, internal conversion due to the population ' s flight into foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have acceded to sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the cost of the minimum package basket would not have jumped 12 per cent per quarter.
The ban on the import of food items has given rise to a shock of supply in the domestic market and has led to an entirely logical increase in final value.
As we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import and increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production at the current stage, the sanctions will continue to carry the risks of growth.
Add to this the fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in national currency as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Raviwaev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
Inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month in the 1990s, zero was also higher than current levels, another case, which was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think inflation will be 8-8.5 per cent at the end of the year.
Plato Maguta, the asset manager of the UK "Maguta Foundation"
The external factor associated with the sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully contained, but if further pressure, particularly on the financial sector, has been raised, this may lead to certain difficulties and inflationary expectations of the population, which are traditionally expressed in the purchase of the cash currency in order to secure their savings.
It may be assumed that the Government, the CBF and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth erosion of the ruble, both through market methods and by government regulation.
But price increases are traditionally beginning after summer’s eclipse and may become more visible in the autumn.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5 per cent is likely to last because the Russian Federation has more financial savings.
Gardening centres mourn the decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, caused by an exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, could result in horticultural centers losing tens of millions of pounds per year when today's young consumers reach the “main age of horticulture”, according to a study by HTA reported by Financial Times.
According to this report, people who rent houses spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that homeowners spend on gardening.
It refers to an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting in front of the parking yard and the reduction of the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, whose annual sales are estimated to be .5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, Britain’s lowest level of expenditure on household gardeners was spent.
HTA and Royal Gardening Society reported that renting housing and the lack of garden space did not mean that humans could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser at RHS, said, "The growing of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the golden age of retail trade in horticultural goods resulting from an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after poor conditions last March and April.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria conducted a massive cleansing of the Lands Foundation.
Three of the four heads of the Landedela Foundation were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Landedela Foundation were replaced on Friday.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria officially reported only the removal of the Executive Director, Atanas Joeva.
Lausan Vasileva took his place.
It turns out that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund were changed in a quiet manner on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatiana Angelov, has been released and has been responsible for the State assistance and SAPARD programme until now, reports to BGNES with reference to the newspaper Trud.
I wasn't present on the fund board because we weren't members of the administration under the law, but I was informed later that I was released.
I cannot say why my dismissal is not reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I learn more on Monday," said Angelov.
It will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatov, who was still the head of the Investment Credit Fund at the Landela Central Fund in Sofia.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nicolai Dachev, was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for EU fields.
It will be replaced by Zhliko Zishkov, who was the head of the Regional Directorate of the Landedela Foundation in the city of Magi-Tirnovo until January 2014.
Only the Deputy Chief of the Atije Alieva-Veli Foundation retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey summons an American diplomat in connection with a report on espionage
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on the American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent reported that an American attorney and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet journal The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for American and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news agencies, the Turkish president, Rejep Taip Erdogan, downgraded the importance of the report by saying that all the major countries were spying one after the other.
Previously reported information that the main intelligence agency in Germany had also made Ankara a subject of exploration has given rise to a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
China's largest companies are united against Alibaba
China's companies, including the largest commercial real estate dealer in China, the Danish Wanda Group, and the Internet giant Tenent Holdings (scissors, Messinger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alabama.
It will not be easy to catch up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which even left its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com behind.
Union of the Major
Companies are planning to invest 5 billion Yuan ($814 million), 70 per cent will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent to each of the Internet companies, according to Wanda Group.
The company is scheduled to register in Hong Kong.
JS will combine Baidu's search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest social network in China, with some 438 million users), Tenent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, the Wanda group manages at least 49 commercial real estate sites throughout China and 40 shopping centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a thematic entertainment park in Qindao (a town on the East coast of China).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors every year and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda is owned by the American AMCOK Holdings Network, which makes the company the largest camera operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to provide all its shopping centres, hotels and entertainment sites for e-commerce services, the development of which will be carried out by the newly created Alibaa competitor.
According to Dun Que, who will lead a new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by the next year.
The new site should be the largest online-to-offline platform in the world, notes Dun Ze.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet to come to the regular off-line business or to buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sale of coupons such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the largest pie in online commerce,” said Wanda Van Jianlin (Bloomberg Citate).
“There is currently no real O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances are approximately equal to all”, he believes.
China's Internet Trade Market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will grow more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, and the official statistics are reported by Bloomberg: this is more than the population of any country in the world, except India.
And it is projected that by 2015, that number could have grown to 850 million.
The Richer Union
The head of Tencent Ma Huathen was, until recently, China's richest man, but according to the Bloomberg millionaire index, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already overrun it by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is in the Alibaba's share.
Baidu Robin Lee now ranks third among the richest people in China, while Van Jianlin of Wanda is fourth in rating.
"In this battle, it's very interesting to see three of the richest people join forces to challenge the wealthier," said Bloomberg, director of China's e-commerce research centre in Hanzhou Tzao Lai.
But he thinks that a new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba once it's created: "Rome cannot be built in one day."
The fact that it is not easy to compete with Alibaba not only new companies but well-deserved leaders of the world's Internet trade is illustrated by the report published the previous day on the financial performance of Alibaba in the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as the average between eBay and Amazon.com, but between April and June, the Chinese company earned more than both its American competitors combined.
The net profit of Alibaba over the period is almost twice that of competitors, which has increased almost threefold in annual terms to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has great potential for generating money, thanks largely to his mobile applications," commented Bloomberg on an analyst's report from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba website of the United States Security and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of company services in July was 188 million, significantly higher than the March 163 million.
In addition, 32.8 per cent of all transactions by Alibaba over the past quarter involved mobile devices.
The value of their shares in front of IPOs is to be stated by Alibaba.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company could be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, the Aliba debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could be held as early as 16 September.
The company that preceded this event will start on 3 September.
It is expected that the IPO output of Alibaba will be the record in the history of NYSE and that it will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
To date, the U.S. exchange rate has been recorded as belonging to the Visa payment system, which initially located its shares in 2008 at $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food items in the trade networks should be Russian manufacturing, the deputies of the State.
They have drafted a bill on this subject.
This is to amend article 8 of the FMG on the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, of at least 50 per cent of domestic products produced in shops should be for every type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in the winter, and therefore they will be given a "severe" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Code of Taxes of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduction of 10 per cent for the sale of all food products of which Russia is the country of origin, reports the newspaper Izvedia.
On 27 August, a draft law was introduced to the lower chamber of Parliament to amend the Retail Markets Act, which proposes that farmers' markets be re-established in Russia in which small producers can carry out their products.
Chief of Police Magaluf is charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Kalwia to the Malorki Public Prosecutor's office on Friday.
The head of the California Police on Malorca resort was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the scandalous Magalufa Center for Unreserved Drinking.
The Chief Inspector, José Antonio Navarro, was detained as a result of allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's daily online release, the complainants submitted evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of California to the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish National Guard guards for allegations of corruption and will be interrogated by the judge along with Navarro.
Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners said that protectionism on the part of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving," said one businessman to the court.
Our sources of existence cannot be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines of the international press this summer, after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer who passed 24 men in a bar run.
The island authorities have since tried to stop bullying among the rest of the Magaluf while minimizing the number of scandalous alcohol races in the bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where a mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage Bars were together fined for €55,000 ($73,000).
The Magalouf tourist resort, mainly popular among young British vacationers, has also been the scene of many alcohol-related accidents, which are associated with a mad game known as "balcing" when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights to the Adelaide Aeroport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in southern Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Aeroport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9: 00 p.m., after 6.6 mm, which fell during the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short downpours with a blowing wind, including a storm that started shortly before 8 p.m. and poured out almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter gave off early spring last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The school conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land on the schedule just after 7:30 p.m., but it got into the wind shift zone -- the sudden change in speed or the direction of the wind at a short distance -- and was forced to gain height.
The winds reached 50 km/h on the ground at the Aeroport of Adelaide at that time.
The flight showed that the plane had to rise during the second landing, and the aircraft finally landed about 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates from Dubai and the Qantas from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two showers.
The calculation of the estimates of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The federal anti-monopoly service takes special control over pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as connectivity issues.
The FAS has established an expert board on building competition.
At its meeting, the head of the control office of the FAC, construction and natural resources of FAS, Wadim Soloviev, stated that “the present calculation of the estimates of construction facilities is completely unclear”.
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable construction price, considered by the FAS.
And it is suggested that the cost of building public facilities at the design stage should be determined on the basis of market prices for constructive solutions rather than today ' s standards and unit costs for technological transactions.
These proposals are on the road map and are currently under consideration by the Ministry.
“The replacement of traditional estimates in construction calculations for design elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” explained Vadim Solovev, “WGB”.
It's not always possible to verify everything in the estimates, so sometimes unfair construction companies can bury “whole tractors” in the documents.
I agree with FAS in the minser.
“The first work on the cost shift for design elements is already under way: methodologies have been developed to calculate the prices of design decisions, to estimate these indicators,” said KGB, head of town planning and architecture of the Elena Zhukov.
Road construction is selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
The head of the Profi-Investment construction company Anatoly Demianco, explained that the estimates were long outdated, but no other business mechanism had yet been proposed.
“As for the proposed design element calculations, it is difficult to do so in practice, since the construction of buildings often uses very different technologies,” he believes.
It's no secret that the building is developing largely because of the State order.
In the opinion of the Chairman of the NP, Ekaterina Lesina, the “Expert Community of Professionals of the State of the State”, is now the most solvent employer.
The Deputy Director of Engineering, Rosatom Vladimir Malakov, Industrial Centre for Capital Construction, drew attention to the fact that today the market is tentatively divided into companies with access to a portfolio of contracts and companies with monopoly competences and no competitors.
He considered that the creation of a transparent market could only be possible if access to contracts was guaranteed to the maximum extent possible by someone in charge.
At the expert board, it was suggested that a system of State orders should be established in such a way that the same perpetrator was not entitled to receive more than one contract worth more than one billion rouble or several contracts worth more than one billion rouble.
The Ministry believes that this approach should be assessed in terms of impact on business as well as efficiency in building management.
As Elena Zukova explained, this would require that the customer be assigned the functions of a gender contractor, resulting in an increase in the number of clients and the budget for its maintenance.
In so doing, the customer will need to have knowledge to assess the quality of the works performed by the contracting organizations and their safety.
It is often necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the departure of highly qualified participants in State purchases because of the lack of interest in receiving a State-owned order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
The co-chairs of the procurement centre of the Institute of Procurement, Alexander Eustashenko, believe that the State order process has now become a business game for the attention of the contractor.
The example is: “a participant in the application must specify “specific indicators” without specifying the words “or equivalent”, “must be”, “be”, “be on”, “be on”, “be on,” “be on,” “analog,” “or”, “type”, “not less”, “below”, “be on,”, “may”, “may have”, “may be on,” “did not earlier”, “not earlier”, “not above”, “not permitted”, and so on.
Employers thus often abuse their right to require the contents of an application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Evastaschenkov, was the need to assess the quality of the job at the application stage through the participant's “paper” proposal.
In considering the application of the participant, only the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of the work that had not yet been done, could be effectively assessed, the expert suggested.
The quality of work can only be assessed if it is accepted.
On the board of experts, it was also suggested that the margin income be transferred from the upper to the lower echelon to allow intermediate contractors to disappear.
The Chairman of the Board of Experts, State Secretary, CEO of FAS, Andrei Kingikovsky believes that this should not be done, since it is the responsibility of the generator to be responsible for the order.
Or else it'll be like the famous Rykin's Arcadia "Atel" retraction: "There's a claim for Puggies?"
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza Strip war
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday, after spending the summer in shelters, when missiles and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed when the area was rebuilt after the fighting.
The beginning of the school cycle brought joy and excitement to the missile-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the signs of fighting remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the Pasosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed fragments of fragments from the walls and children's mountains before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're happy to look to the future," said Ronette Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to come back to a meaningful life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly she started going back to school "a little weird."
"There was a hard time, and we didn't leave our homes," she said.
President Raven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz, which is located near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the cease-fire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of people living on the border, such as Sa ' ad, did not go outside or leave their homes, leaving for safer areas away from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, settlements near the Gaza border where a four-year-old boy was killed by a piece of Palestinian mine, doubt their need to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which had suffered greatly from Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to learn diligently and said, “We will do our utmost to provide you with knowledge and safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately brought an end to hostilities, but key issues remained, such as Hamas ' s demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
It is expected that a new phase of indirect negotiations will begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, were killed in the war, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militia; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting Hamas and other Gazan fighters fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
In the meantime, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed by Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools, which have been transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fighting continued, education officials delayed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon open up so that we can complete our education like children from all over the world and Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza's schools.
According to the popular criteria, real estate prices showed the largest winter increase in seven years.
The RP Data Core Legal Housing Index for Housing Prices in the Australian Capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reported RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined 4.2 per cent increase in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the 12-month increase by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
Research director RP Data Tim Loules reported that Sydney and Melbourne were running a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney housing prices increased by 16.1 per cent over the past year, while in Melbourne they increased by 11.7 per cent.
The next market capacity was Adelaide, Brisbein and Darwin, where prices averaged between 5 and 6 percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government cost reductions were made, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Loulis said that now that spring began, there would be an increase in the number of real estates put on sale over the next few months, which would be a "real test" for the market.
"Taking into account the current high auction speed, the overall high sales speed and the current low interest rate conditions are likely to increase the cost of housing in the next three months," he said.
How Do People Live in the Oldest House of Ufa?
In the former home of gold manufacturers and miners, Evdoquim and his son Ivan Demid on the streets of the October Revolution 57/1 (former Grand Kazanese) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has not changed much since construction, except for the fact that it is a small house.
Foreigners walk here as a tour, and residents suffer more than they rejoice at their privilege of living in the oldest of Ufim's houses, whose walls are remembered by General Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is not accurate and historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out it's not a little 300 years old.
Old court, always open door, squeaking stairs.
The doors in the apartment are close to each other, the walls crack, and there's a street in the passage of the plastered plaster.
I think everything holds true.
And the local people say, "You don't think it's true."
Living in a wooden house in the 18th century is very difficult, ” says Tatyana Lukiyano, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The site is in the public service, but the money to maintain it doesn't go away for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities just forgot about.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still thinly stuck, but the foundation's gone.
Many residents still go to the bathroom outside and pray once a week in a public bath.
How can we be content under such circumstances?
The road passes right under the windows, not even the pedestrian zone.
Tatyana pulls away the curtain.
Now you can see that before, you've only heard that there's a flow of cars underneath the windows.
You see, the glass is constantly combing, we can't open the windows, we're used to noise.
But man is accustomed to everything, to what is good and what is bad.
Our apartment is still model, thank you husband, his hands are gold.
In particular, we have two rooms, living three with our son.
And for other families, conditions are much worse, and on the second floor, the ceilings are just over a foot and a half high.
In contrast, Tatyana offers to visit a neighbor from Ljudmila Starstarna's apartment No. 6.
A friendly hospitable woman offers a cup of coffee from the doorstep and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we still live with my husband and my daughter and her grandson.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been any other room, because Sophia's eyes are on the room: anthresols, two couches of "g," and one of them is a grandson with a laptop.
Very closely and very little is different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historic."
But from the ceiling, the plumbing system doesn't work.
Sophia speaks of her apartment as an ordinary and amazing thing at the same time as an Italian woman whose house is on Roman ruins.
I mean, it's one very old and recent, day-to-day and legendal:
The plumbing took place some 40 years ago during the last repair.
At the same time, we had a small kitchen in the back of the room and a toilet from the ex-heart.
We live right where Demids and his family lived, and on the second floor, there were servants.
Our apartment isn't privatized, so why?
The Ufa Real Estate Center says privatization does not matter.
We'll only get a one-room apartment anyway, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised to settle down, but the promise did not go any further.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
This apartment (room!) was inhabited by an entire dynasty: my grandparents, my mom and dad, my husband and my daughter and their grandson.
Everything's been through that time.
Healthy rats, for example, ran through the kitchen.
Look at the ceiling walls, they're three feet thick!
They say the solution's been stuck on the eggs, so it's been held up for so long.
The house is solidly built, thank you Damidas.
That's probably why no one was killed by a falling ceiling or by their own.
Only the building is slowly dying in front of us — the boards and the log houses rot, the floors are repeatedly falling apart, we are filling with cement, but it's useless -- the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say it's under our room of the secret loop and the way to the White River, which specifically made the old men who lived here once so that they could escape danger, in which case.
They were persecuted.
Sophia Starstyna tells of some historian coming to them, begging them to let him start a excavation in the apartment.
And then he convinced them to give their property in exchange for his one-on-one apartment on the Avenue of Octabri.
Sophia's story says:
Where do we go four times alone?
And there's a little hope here that's going to give you more space.
We agreed to the exchange, nothing would have won.
The old man's family didn't win anything.
Ludmila's biggest dream was to be settled, and her 16-year-old daughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families have a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations live right now.
A pretty, miniature girl from apartments Nos. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two close rooms, a total of 23 m2, called apartments, live her large family.
We're just seven people, two kids.
You can see the conditions.
It is broken off by pieces, like window frames, in the kitchen walls and in rooms of cross - section holes.
The water in the tap is only cold for a year.
As you walk through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can see that the greatest luck you've ever had is Lavrentiev's wife from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the outermost rooms in the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
A 75-square room, three people written down.
We live in the very rooms where, by legend, Suvorov stayed while he was in Ufa,” says Alexander Dmitrijevich Lavrentyev, head of the family.
The ceilings are tall, wide.
One bad thing is that everyone is cracking around the seams, falling apart, falling down.
Neighbors must have already told us!
The most painful thing about us and our floors is that the wooden boards rotted, the ground literally went under our feet.
I've put the stakes, the blades; nothing else in the room; and in the other room, we walk like we do on the swings, so fast.
A merchant's house, Eudoquim Demidov Alexander Dmitriewicz, can tell you better than any tour guide.
The gold industry is treated as a native, and it is admired.
Indeed, the owner of Kagin and Uzian factories built houses, poured out guns and bells, and held Arab mines.
The heirs of purchase property are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child in the '40s, in the 20th century, ” says Alexander Dimitrijevic.
At that time, there were wooden carriage rooms, stables and caraul booths, which were subsequently destroyed.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but something was wrong.
The story was repeated in 2014: new housing was again lured.
As a team, we collected all the documents, escaped the necessary authorities, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartment was to be moved to 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in all this...
Two years ago Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashcortostan to learn about the fate of the home.
Resident officials didn't accept.
They sent from one table to another, and then, in ridicule, they issued a paper without signature or press, saying, "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the resettlement of residents."
I even felt like our house was long gone, because first it was 57, then it became 57 A, and now it's 57/1.
It's like it was destroyed in the 1970s.
The “Russia Planet” has approached the Chief Information and Analysis Branch of the Land Administration of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
A house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the residential settlement programme.
I can't take responsibility for the actions of officials of the 1970s, but I know that there was a plan to demolish all old houses at that time, despite the historic significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities to rebuild all the old houses in the streets of the October Revolution, which are of architectural value, has been successfully implemented.
Residents are soon planned to settle in new apartments.
According to Barabas, the House of Demidova will be renovated by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
An architectural binnal is currently in progress in Italy, and the “Old Ufa” project is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire old Kazan Street will be restored, says the official.
Homes will have a proper look, similar to what they were three centuries ago.
Demidov’s house is likely to become a museum open to all.
In addition, it has been decided at the government level to make the street a pedestrian weekend.
It's not going to work, unfortunately, because there's too much traffic in the city.
Russell from the future Museum of Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
But they are unlikely to be content with their new apartments being the same as the current ones.
Only from another age.
In Primorie, the storm started a forest fire
The dry storm caused a forest fire in the areas of the Hunting Forest in the Pozar district of the Primorsky.
At the site of the fire, a group of forces and funds is being strengthened.
According to the management of CGHS, the Primor Air Base requires the deployment of aviation forces at the site of the fire.
Vasili Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Airbase:
A fire in a difficult area found an observer pilot flying an AN-2 patrol aircraft in an area of 3 hectares.
The wood residues on the old burner are on fire.
The Territory ' s heavy cloud and steep slopes of more than 45 degrees, the lack of landing-level fire-fighting sites pose significant challenges for the loss of life.
We need an MI-8 helicopter.
The delivery of the forces by an MI-2 helicopter and an AN-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After a fire was detected, four parachutists were promptly removed.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the ground for the delivery of additional fire-fighting forces and equipment.
In the area of lunch, 3 additional fire fighters were brought to the village area by a hunting helicopter.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, the specialists will be moved to the area of extinguishation, reported on the Primorsky Province Administration website.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica in Dadley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, "Rudi's Raids," which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mixture of horn and rap, and the tunes are lifesome.
Henry, however, had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother died, there was a "many" treatment, and Henry often reflected on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice say, "No, stop making noises.
Get off your sister.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seimur and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a kid, would go to the pub with him and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket kick.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was such a funny guy in the corner reading the newspaper for most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a writing workshop in Dadley, and although conditions were better than in his father’s day, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
It's a little bit better now, but it's dark, smokeful, deep mazes of fire and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father got into the bathroom and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to get away from the casting shop.
When I got there, I realized that he had done this for years and years to make a living for us, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry left childhood without parental affection.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It wasn't until my mom got sick at the end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don France, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don Frank.
Why don't I make friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with France, who married him for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I make friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical action.
Then I started serious phytence classes, and I also had to sit down on a strict diet to get rid of my symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's career path shift is perhaps reflected in his noble, short beard.
Ever since he got the confession of critics for his Otello, he's been totally trapped in the theater.
I followed "The Comedy of Errors" and then "The fences" by August Wilson.
This work is different from the satcoms and comedy, which were an integral part of his rich professional life.
He started a career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
Dijey noticed how he rocks on stage and wrote about him in "New Faces."
His career on television began in the mid-70s, saying, "For quite a long time, I was the only black paradox on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I had to learn to be an effective machine for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985 as a star working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in "New Persons" in 1975
Because his manager had the right to "Black and White minstrels Show", an easy entertainment program in which people turned their face in, Henry found himself performing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I think I want it never to happen to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although this was a strange, condemnable position, I worked in large areas and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the prized easy entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "the grotesque parody of black people."
Illustrating and singing about the black culture in the United Kingdom, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of the "Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984 and was known at nine o'clock as, among other things, Gareth Blacklock's chef from Chief's comedy show.
Advertising videos, documentary films, TV series and the role of the movie took the next 10 years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008, Lenny Henry.tv thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it's a little bit like you're pulling your time or quietly turning aside."
And then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's the Good In..."
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I had real allergies on Shakespeare.
It's not like I'm being taught this completely at school, and I thought it was, to a large extent, the prerogative of middle class white people with bells and hoods down in front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You should try.
Don't worry about it until you know what you're talking about.
Do some of these words out loud, and you'll understand why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Otello's last monologism for documentary transmission, and it got caught.
I felt like I could do it.
It's like my head was corrected.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, taking it seriously, learning your text, doing a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we put it.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for a catastrophe, and it didn't happen.
We soon started the Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the public.
"A quiet voice inside me said, "You're gonna have to work 10 minutes while they're doing the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else deal with this.
"You play a play, stay in the play."
Henry's in the "Abortions" at the Duches Theater
It was difficult to learn the text for the fences.
Panic is useful enough to strengthen the musculature.
She was also accepted well, so it was like a sign above showing you "what you should do."
He's saying that, of course, with a thunderous voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry's still thinking about the comedian -- all the way through our conversation, when he starts, he's gonna end up parody.
I just decided not to work in the booth, because this thing with instant remuneration from a complete stranger's room, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're looking forward to it all the time, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work on the Apollo Airline when I want to, but mostly I don't get as much pleasure as I used to.
I'm wondering if he's gonna give the bench tour one day.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle, and the end of the journey -- I don't think I'll ever want to give it up.
So it's a new reality?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice fun.
You always tell a story, and there's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who are not registered in the next two weeks will no longer be paid shall be reported in the Government ' s statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after they have left the public service.
President Uhuru Keniata promised to reduce corruption in public structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit found earlier this year that at least $1 million (70000) per month was lost through payments to “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to be paid in bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC Vanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public officials are required to appear in the next two weeks at identification centres to guarantee that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, as reported in a government statement.
Anyone who fails to do so without a valid reason will be removed from the payment statement.
“This procedure will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of civil servants and will also be used to clear a statement of payments at both levels of Government, thus putting an end to the problem of `invisible workers',” said Ann Wajguru, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Structure of Power.
Ten Turkish police officers arrested in connection with a “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the Government”, reports local news agencies.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Herrriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in anti-corruption activities last December, which were aimed at reviewing government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and listening to the phone.
Turkish President Reggie Tayip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic clique Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day has traditionally been a great occasion for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsini Yatsinuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told expected journalists that not all schools had opened again, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not held at every school.
There is no peaceful sky above every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful heavens.
The whole of Ukraine, the great single Ukrainian people's front, must fight for the peaceful heavens.
Alexan Pastukhov, head of the Slavyansk school, where Jaczouk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study has traditionally been observed by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons, and giving flowers to their teachers.
Rona Fairhead BBC may have found the kind of inspiring leader she needs.
It is followed by a record of fame from the banking world, the media administration and the interior of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience in decision-making positions.
Her career began at Bain and Co, a consulting firm for global governance, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world media in Pearsons.
She was the manager of the Financial Times for seven years when she resigned when a male colleague in the main company of Pearson's took up her senior position.
It's said that her earnings are close to 1 million.
Her political rating is also strong.
It was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband's former adviser to Tori.
Earlier in May, I named the Chairman's work as a poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the very heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two objectives: inside as the top management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable Duopoly that requires complete radical reform.
However, which new chairman would risk coming to untie and destroy an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he himself lost his job in the process.
It's a tough solution.
It wouldn't have been that hard, many people would be happy to see BBC reduce its size - after its redefinition of power, finance and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge comfortable old habits, inevitable negotiations on the cost of a licence pose a particular danger to BBC.
For a modest amount of .145.50 per year, the British acquire a share of the world’s largest media plant, of course.
BBC tells a good story: it states that it covers 96% of its households and stands only 40p per day.
Moreover, it is clear that Beeb's popularity is growing, with 53 per cent now supporting it, compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The models for watching and using BBC have changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch the missed software on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope it found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating Twitter was written by someone else.
A Twitter from the confirmed account of the Governor of Texas, the Republican Rick Perry, on Sunday evening contained an offensive image of the district attorney from the democracies, who is at the centre of criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
The Twitter was later removed and followed by another account from Perry, in which the record was disproved.
A tweet was just posted from my account, which was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I've removed it," says a later recording.
Perry’s assistants did not immediately respond to the communications requesting comment.
Although the records were downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was actually publishing on that tape.
An earlier tweet contained a sloppy cartoon for the District Attorney, Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of drinking in April 2013.
Perry banned the funding of her office when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a large jury in Athens this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in 2016 elections.
The text reads: “I do not always drive a car in a state of intoxication three times the allowable level of alcohol in the blood... but when I do this, I charge Governor Perry for telling me.”
I'm the most drunk democracy in Texas.
The Lembergh department did not investigate a large jury against Perry.
They were occupied by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed as a Republican judge.
Perry did not confess guilt and called the charges a political trick.
His powerful legal team had asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the governor, who was the longest in the history of Texas, would be vague, contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding by $7.5 million from the State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in the public sector of Texas when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto had raised an official complaint from a public monitoring group with left-wing views.
Perry's confirmed account is often updated, and is sometimes famous.
When Perry came to the fifth party convention in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, he responded to rumours that he could leave the game by tweeting a photograph of himself running next to the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Burkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to a "normal state"
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England had “returned” to normal activity.
Homes in the capital were subject to lively demand and rising prices, and there was widespread fear that a credit bubble would lead Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijley, founder and chairman of Berkeley, an elite construction company, said on Monday: “From the beginning of this fiscal year, the market has returned to the normal level of transactions since the peak of 2013,” adding that this provided a `stabilistic working environment'.
London’s real estate market succeeded during the recession, as foreign buyers moved into the capital.
The city ' s prices have risen by 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly oversaw the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
By the end of April, the average market prices for private, affordable and student schemes had increased by about one fifth.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around potential “temple tax” prior to the general election next May.
The London Real Estate Agency, Foxtons, warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced tighter loan terms, would also lead to a decline in market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, involving further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its projection of rising London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent, on the basis that real estate prices have already begun to decline.
In the meantime, transactions fell by a quarter of the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, according to WA Allis.
Nevertheless, the demand for houses in the capital has proved to be very beneficial for Berkeley, raising sales above ?2.2 billion.
Mr. Pigley added, "The demand for the right product with the best design and position remained unchanged and reflected this, continued to be sold for a while."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year before the end of April, almost a third more than the 2007 pre-crisis peak.
The annual profit before paying taxes increased by 40 per cent from the previous year to the previous year, and income by 18 per cent to the previous year.
Speaking on Monday before the company ' s annual meeting, Mr. Pijley reported that the expected revenue of Burkeley for the year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, profits are expected year-to-year prior to the payment of taxes in the US$ 450 million.
The value of the Berkeley shares was kept at .23.96 in the afternoon on the London exchange.
Pictures of naked Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
The images of an exposed actress, Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar prize, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who believes he has a catalogue of pictures of another 100 rising stars.
The representative of the Star of the Hunger Games confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence were real and condemned the hacker for "immediate invasion of personal space".
Law enforcement agencies have been approached, and they will pursue anyone who will publish stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photographs originally posted on the 4han exchange site were allegedly due to a lack of the Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged haemorrhage catalogue of hacked victims includes the names of a dozen female celebrants, including Rianna, Kim Cardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary Kate Olsen, according to Buzfed.
It is not clear how many of these photographs are true, although the Star of Scott Pilgrim against All, Winsted on Twitter, has also condemned hacking.
"Those who look at the pictures that we took with my husband a few years ago when we were alone at home -- I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winston on Twitter.
But Victoria Justice, of Nickolodeon's series "iCarly's" and "Victorious Victoria", denied that she had written on Twitter, "These are so-called photos of I'm naked by FALSWICK, a people.
Let me stop it in the embryo.
Buzfeed reported last Sunday that Ariana Grande's pop star representative denied that the pictures she was supposed to be wearing were genuine.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new love novel and the letter "J" that praised critics
They were dissolved, and the best thing to say is that, they were gradually falling apart like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only at times did a woman tell him that he was too serious, too heavy to communicate, tense, closed, and perhaps somewhat irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw a bit of irritability in himself.
He was barbarian, yes.
The last victim of this thorny thing was a little novel from which he expected more than usual to be freed from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a passionately fragile beauty with broken hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village even more remote and harsh than Port Royben.
She came south with a companion older than herself, whom she considered to be aunts, and the latter inherited a house in a raw but paradiselike valley under the joyful name "Rain Valley".
No one lived in the house for several years.
The tubes were running, the spiders were sitting upright in their baths, and the mucus left their tracks on every window, confident that the house belonged to them; and the garden was filled with weeds, which resembled the giant marmots.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, simultaneously frightening and charming, with a complete secret garden.
The author's view is Howard Jacobson, whose "J" novel is included in the Buckerow Prize Long List in 2014.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Quever and Aileen were sitting by their hands in broken loungers among the tall grass, enjoying the suddenly warm spring day; they were both scattered to a cheap console that provided the country with soothing music and soothing news when, looking at her crossed brown feet, he remembered the old song of a long - forgotten black performer, whom his father loved to listen to, dropped curtains in the house.
You've got too big a leg.
Because of their inherent aggression, the songs of this type were no longer played on consoles.
They were not forbidden - nothing was prohibited - but they were not lost.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word archaic.
Public taste has done things that could never have been achieved by orders and prescriptions, and just as books have chosen the memoirs of rich people growing up in poverty, culinary books and love novels, they have chosen ballads from all the music.
On this day's trip, Kevin started playing the imaginary piano and the rough, comic voice singing Eileen's big legs.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular Jazz Piano song, called Fats Waller," he told her, machineically putting two fingers to her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she goes off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was little.
His father played her with his father as he told him.
Start the word "J" by forgetting to attach two fingers to your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew that he was expecting it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Aileen never heard of it.
Jazz didn't play, although he wasn't openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the tune started, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end.
It's the same with sharpness.
His unpredictability worked on people's nerves.
Jazz was a piece of music.
Although he reached the age of 10 without ever hearing of Sammy Davis Jr., Kever knew of the jazz from a father's semisecret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Aileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she could hardly remember the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no law or pressure.
The society was obedient, which meant that each of its segments agreed to the thanks - the gratitude of those who had been preserved by fate - to the principle of group bias.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin, by temperament and physical characteristics, were well suited for entertainment and sports, and they were singing and running.
Indostans, like nature's talented in everything about electronics, started to make sure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was done by sanitary work; what was left of the Greek was beaten by a plate.
Those from the Persian Gulf and Lévant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, when what they saw happened, were afraid of being accused of burning the flame, fearing, in fact, that the flames would consume them by the next one, opened up restaurants with labbies and hookers, and would not hang out, and flicked about inaction.
Each one by his or her abilities.
Since she had heard only ballads before, Eileen found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that Kevin had just sang to her could have been based on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kever.
Unless maybe for people with big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the garden that was set up gave him an illusion of safety.
No word could pass through the soundproofing of giant leaves that resembled the capstos.
Aileen still didn't understand.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it's a joke, but he didn't want to press two fingers against his lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She's messed up her head in disbelief, closing the view.
The world as a whole was nothing but a fossil of her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying in her opinion.
But that doesn't explain why you're eating it.
She seemed really upset.
Am I too big a leg?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I've got such a perversion.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often brought him into awkward situations, for, like his father, he lacked a soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty covered in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he did, Cover, too.
Despite good eyes.
Eileen Solomons was brightened and rose from the chaff, overthrew the console and spilled the wine they drank.
The wine from the buzine, so the intoxication could not justify it.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you 'cause you have a stupid head," she said...
I don't like it, though.
He was sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She did not talk to him about living in the cold northern Archipelago, where she grew up, but he did not doubt that she was basically like the one here.
The same huge ice ocean hit both of them.
The same mischievous men, even more sensitive and capricious after what had happened, had been driven beyond their ancestors, smugglers, and destroyers, wandered furiously from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand against any woman who dared to refuse them or to provoke them.
Dumb head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
A kiss first - a kiss is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; an anti-aircraft against the fresh ballads that the console produced - first kiss it and then hit it.
An unnecessary clarification, according to Coveran, because it was a hooliganism to kiss yourself.
Aileen Solomons' body showed him he needed to leave.
He got up from a chauffeur like an old man.
She felt the lead burden herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she watched him leave, and her companion was a man himself who was causing hardship.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and men in general, although some of them raised their hand against her.
The man who turned away from her, with his back bent down, ashamed, battled, all the struggle left him -- why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember a single case until today when she saw it?
One more Aileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or around Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and energetic 32-year-old researcher who had worked in Ofnau, an informal public-mental control service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and middle-level violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decline, if it did not stop entirely, given the resources and forces allocated to its eradication.
"A lot has been done, and a lot has been done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggression of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow sections of the area, where churches spied over the gardens, the tender breath of human kindness was rarely felt in history.
However, some qualities are not eradicated.
The higher the pin, it seems, the lower his passions.
The population sheds tears on sentimental ballads, swallows up stories about the obstacles overcome and proclaims its dusting faith in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does old rudeness remain strong in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is evidence of new and vicious harassment in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate habit of writing too much," said her scientific leader, reading the report as a whole.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum put her head down.
I must also ask you, Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," replied Emme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," finally said Luther Rabinitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
There's no prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, totally acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort results, such as what you have shown me.
It's obvious that you're prejudiced against the church yourself, and what you call "wicked" and "grabber," others would interpret as an expression of natural life's love and energy.
To keep getting bored about the one thing that happened when the World War I happened, as if it had happened, if ever, yesterday, was to deprive the country of the life it needed.
Esma Nussbaum looked around while Rabinitz was speaking.
Behind his head pink, like a flamengo, the LED letters echoed the advice Ofnau gave the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, talk, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, a word of song better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you mean to say," replied Esma Nussbaum quietly when she was convinced that her scientific leader had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been cured as effectively as we can convince ourselves.
I'm concerned that if we're not ready, we'll find that we're repeating the mistakes that initially led to what happened when the General Assembly did.
Only this time will we throw our anger and mistrust upon others.
Luther Rabinitz put his fingers together in a pyramid.
That gesture was meant to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling "mistakes" the actions that our grandparents did or did not do.
You go too far, and when you talk about putting their anger and mistrust on "others."
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, by understanding the past, by protecting the present, we do not speak of "us" and "they".
There was no "we" and there were no "others."
It was a time of unrest, that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with oneself," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can rightly justify itself.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done was done.
It was then.
Nothing else to say - we agree here.
And if you don't have to blame anyone, you don't have to justify yourself if it's appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why is the past, if not to learn?
The past thing to make us forget it.
If I can add one word -
Luther Rabinitz’s Piramidian collapsed.
"I'll consider your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went to the sidewalk, described by passersby as "in a vicious rage."
There's coincidences.
Lesotho Army states that no coup was planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The Lesotho Army denied that a coup had been prepared to overthrow the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police, who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country's army surrounded its official residence and occupied Government buildings in Maseru's capital.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with suicide.
The army representative, Major Ntlele Ntoi, stated that there was no coup, but that the army responded to the threat posed by the “political fanatics” whom the police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command has taken steps to obtain a number of intelligence reports that there are some elements in the police force that are actually planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were prepared to cause chaos”, he told the Voice of America.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Monjela, stated that the army's actions looked like a coup.
“While no one had filed a claim for the taking of power by force, it was reported that the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces currently had the main signs of a coup,” he said.
The Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers had returned to barracks on Sunday and that it was calm in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing manages the Government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane stated that he believed he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabana suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his unified Government.
He stated that his actions had not undermined the Government, despite allegations of the contrary.
The Chelsea protector, Marco van Ginkel, will spend the next season on lease rights in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours to undergo a medical examination.
During the past season, he only went to a field in London’s club three times.
Remember what Milan used to rent from Liverpool's attacking Fernando Torres.
Production in the eurozone on the lowest 13 months
The growth in production in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The last value of the Eurozone production index (PMI) for Markit fell to 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed and enterprises have been affected by growing tensions between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
Values came to the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will wait for a clear plan from the bank to deal with the recovery of the eurozone and the risk of deflation for inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
It is suggested that the head of the ECB, Mario Draga later this week, may give additional signals, that he is considering a quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by Great Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than any growth, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more evident," said Rob Dobson, senior economist Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia ' s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest point 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of great concern, as is Italy ' s weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth momentum has been reduced mainly by an industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also does not add confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowing down of industry is likely to carry the oil into the fire for analysts awaiting the introduction of additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One good news was from Ireland, where PMI has grown to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist of IHS Global Intelligence, said, "The best thing to say about the August study of the business index of the production sector of the eurozone is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: “The producers of the eurozone are obviously finding life very difficult at this time, because the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly those related to Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainties to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has apparently hit business - especially consumer confidence - and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "it's more like" that the ECB would eventually have to do some kind of quantitative mitigation, "although we suspect it's going to be limited."
The people of Mariupoli will show up a live chain against the militias.
In Mariupola until last week, it was quiet - no one was ready to organize the Mariopolian People's Republic, and the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
The residents now look forward with horror to the arrival of the "Occupiers".
Political scientists say that separatists are breaking into Mariopola to reach the Azov Sea - the city of Novoazowsk was recently adopted, which was not part of the self-proclaimed republics either.
The Mariopolians decided that the Ukrainian army, although protecting them, had a little force against the highly armed members of the NAM-LDL, and were about to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and strengthens.
On Saturday evening, several thousand people arrived at the eastern border of the city and entered a busy chain, crucifying Ukraine’s anthem.
They're going to do the same thing in case of an attack.
The volunteers collect and collect equipment and food, collect medicines, and publish the newspaper.
Stores are gradually closing in the city, banks and ATMs are being shut down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the terrible capture of school like the children who have been in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day test that shocked the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during the school violence
Just ten years after the terrible capture of the Beslan school, which claimed the lives of 334 people, 186 of whom were heroicly survivors were warned last night of a new Apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be something of a kind of extreme possible evil.
The tragedy has brought the east and west together in a reversal, which, in a remarkable way, turned into action and hope for the future in the face of the greatest grief.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan, in southern Russia, to find some of the victims who had deceived the death of a violent school.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted the scourge, even though the memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now putting up with Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now end.
The girl in the picture is trying to get back to the shooting gymnasium.
It was recorded in a picture of a famous Russian photographer, Dimitri Belayakov, who was trying to get back into the shooting gymnasium after a mine explosion.
She was desperate for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them had died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run, but I couldn't," Aida said then.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely restored, but yesterday she said, "I got back pain three months ago.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few fragments remain in my lap.
Its goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the same way that doctors helped them.
"This tragedy changed my life, but of course it didn't break it," she said with a call.
"It happened to me, and it cannot be changed.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it any other day.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Deer Gapoev was murdered there.
We played together when we were little, and we wanted to go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think of my family later.
She says that her capture remains with her, although memories are a little dull every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the assistance we received from people from Britain and from all over the world.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I'm in the school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through hail of bullets, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians begin school at 7 years of age) and survived three days of capture with their mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "My mother told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him, "Flee."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran off and saw the crying baby on the road, grabbed the baby by the hand, and ran through hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who had seized his son from the outside, said, "Damyr told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I was unable to save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in a hospital with leg injuries, thinking that her son had died.
After their reunification, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran away and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent newspaper, News of the World), where he was awarded as Protector of Children from the Barrardo's Foundation by Prime Tony Blair and his wife, Sheri.
"This is a nightmare coming back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
I can still tell you that he's going through my memory.
I remember the moment I threw away all my toy weapons.
But now I can play video game shooting, and it's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think of myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard I never got out.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to pick whatever I wanted, and I was allowed to travel in an open-top car.
But now he fears for places such as Ukraine, where wars cause the grief that he and his friends have experienced.
This terror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damier, who was doing volunteer work at the women's monastery last week.
I want to help.
I want to serve as a police officer, and I hope I'm admitted to the Academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, age 48, said, "37 kids were killed in our block, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence immediately after the capture, there were no children screaming and running around, and the silence lasted for many months.
She remembers her trip to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I realized that people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, and they can provide support.
She was grateful to Sheri Blair and her Foundation for that award and for the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat a boar, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waitresses at a restaurant, Damier shooting at them with his water gun, and they were running and playing with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and to support us.
She said, "I don't think this world has been any better in 10 years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just children like ours.
I think for a lot of people war is a news report they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very mild and calm boy, and he was neither aggressive nor angry.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not wrapped up in this last nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym every now and then and then they light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it -- I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
I didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and stand on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell all around me while parts of the body were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run, run," but again, I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran.
In this way life continues for us, unlike so many others.
George Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photograph after the capture became a determining factor for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: Survivor Beslan George Ilin with his mother Fatima after his capture in 2004 and George's case today
His bloodthirsty face was marked by fear when he was rescued from death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54 years old, was taken to school on the first day of her studies before taking his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days in a nightmare," she remembered.
Not exactly alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George survived.
The closer the date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's not a single day when we don't remember this tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some of the scenes of those days are in front of my eyes all the time.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
In the shower, Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember George was so eager to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of George's crying in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookstore at our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this picture, people around the world are feeling our pain.
George now says, "It's important that this never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never learn the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was called?
This world is leading to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants a war because it's happening?
Ten years is nothing to hurt.
We need to take decades to forget her.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years old, I had nightmares of capture, but now it's better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going into this gymnasium in front of every 1 September.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gymnasium, but I have to do it.
I don't feel a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life is going on.
I graduated from school this year and went to medical school in Vladikakakaz.
I'm going to study to become a cardiosurgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health wouldn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it's not gonna happen.
George Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
Unbelievable: George Farniev was at the feet of a killer terrorist during the seizure, but he survived.
During the seizure, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer terrorist.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says George, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but could not because of the damage to his health during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children can easily cope with bad events -- I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little bit better after that, but I can't forget it.
I wish I could forget.
In 2005, the first and last time I entered this gymnasium was next year.
I'm unconscious.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I've been sitting in this famous photograph.
Survivor: George Farniev today with a laptop photo of himself in the hospital after capture
My pain is great, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as physical condition is concerned, I'm well.
I need to be careful with the knee that's been damaged, but I'm on my way now.
But health didn't let me go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that this was not possible.
My second attraction was animals, so I went to the veterinary school.
I've studied there for two years.
He's learning how to treat all the cats and cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
It's not what children should know, and of course it's not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, age 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I'll go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know Georgie's not going.
She's supposed to be stronger for him because he was there and I'm not.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
George's an adult now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's got several operations, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he's 50 percent out of that nightmare, but you can't completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the seizure, which only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what's going on in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe it.
We were the only friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them away, as far as possible.
Alona Tskaeva, 10 years old
A young man who was emotionally taken to a safe place by a Special Forces fighter
Saved: Alenu Tskaev is taken to a safe place by the Russian Special Forces (left).
She's ten (right) now, and she doesn't remember a terrible crime.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alena took a Russian policeman from a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, her ten-year-old sister, Christine, and Brother Mahar in the school gym.
Machar, who was then three, was saved, but Alenina’s mother and sister died in a deadly slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has since remarried, and they and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little daughter whom he called Christine in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alona, now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and blossoms into a smart and life - threatening girl, the neighbors say.
"They are a great happy family now, and Alona and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Singji Kagawa, a defender who returned from Manchester United to the Dortmund “Bossia”, noted that he looked forward to returning to the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a happy career event.
Of course, I'm glad I'm going to play for "Bossia" again, and Bild says Cagawa.
I feel very good.
A field of positive emotion and looking forward to entering the field again in the form of "Bossia".
Remember, Kagawa moved to the MoU in the summer of 2012 for Euro16 million.
However, he was never able to be a member of the English club, holding only 38 matches in two seasons in the English championship, scored six balls and gave eight results.
A man is accused of riding a girl at a Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fifa
A 78-year-old man will be brought to trial on charges of a three-year-old girl at the Pelican Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fifa.
Gordon Stuart allegedly shot down a girl at the Pittenwin crossing in East Nowk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart had led his Audi Q3 without due diligence and care and had hit the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78 years old, from Anstruter, denied his guilt in Dundee's sheriff's court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the royal lawyer, set the date of the trial for January.
Obama, Merkel and Holland won't end up in Vladivostok
The duty-free business store at Duty Free Airport Vladivostok removed a plate prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders in the shop.
Don't turn them into perfumes, vodka and horse.
The shop administration decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, Chancellor of FRG Angel Merkel, President François Alland of France, Vitaly Click, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and a number of other prominent comrades would not be able to extract vodka, horse and perfume from their shop.
And I put a tablet on the door.
Obama had previously been banned from an even less serviceable institution, the Dietary Table Centres, as reported by the site of the General Service.
Whether the U.S. president ever wanted to eat in a diet dining room in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the prohibitions clearly seem to be extremely clever.
After the embargo, did Medvedev give advice to the agricultural community?
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dimitri Medvedev, believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should develop new technologies in order to ensure the production of the raw materials required by buyers.
The Board was given during its visit to the South Pacificprom company Agrocomplex.
The Head of Government also advised the Rectors to adjust to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the appropriate level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since 7 August.
The main trainer of the Russian Federation, Valentine Maslak, is pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, third place is a good result given the lack of targeted preparations for competitions.
Our athletes spoke at their level, with Maslakoff's words "This Sport."
The third is the confirmation of our high enough command level.
It is a pleasure that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We must bear in mind that we were not preparing for these competitions.
The season is over, and we did not commit our leaders to participating in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we've been the second in this tournament, but during this season we've been updated.
On the contrary, the French set up a fighting team of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, as has been publicly announced on many occasions.
Even so, the contest owners were unable to resist the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have acted in such a representative company at a good level.
But in some species, the results were in order lower than the same "Brilliant League".
Season's over.
Of course, athletes are no longer as important as the team-level competition.
The main thing here was a place.
As a result, we agree that it was absurd for men to get so involved in the tactical maneuvers of the race at 1500 metres that they showed the results below the average... of the women's races.
4 Hints on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a picture or take a video under the water, there are a number of options.
The cheapest option is a watertight mill, e.g. Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures on a family holiday with a couple of cameras, all at a cost of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, several rules must be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure the camera battery and other compartments are locked tight.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you're going to take.
Some cameras and cameras have surveying modes or object types that optimize the exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can go down.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our customer management and digital camera ratings for both traditional and watertight models.
Take off a few people because many of them won't.
The mills have an LCD that will help you make pictures, whereas the action cameras don't usually have them.
Even if you have a CDC, it will be hard to see under the water, and it will be a random process.
So do a few things.
Also, if your camera has a serial recording mode that takes off a few people with a little different exposures, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The amount of light is significantly decreasing than you are diving into the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when taking off in the pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to pass more colors on photographs; the deeper you go, the smaller you will see.
Come closer to the sites.
This is a great advice for land surveying, but it's even more important under water because of dark light conditions.
Especially important if you are filming an action camera: this equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to get closer to the sites if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Bronze Spearhead of the Olympic Games on the Free Fight of Bilal Mahov can be transformed into a Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by Sajid Sajid Sajidov, chief coach of the complete Dagestan struggle.
A specialist did not exclude the participation of an athlete at the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
At present, Bilal Machov is at the meeting of the classics team, with the words “R-Sport” of Sajid Saidov.
In fact, Bill's underages were both.
In the world ' s first youth of 2005, he won the Voltaires tournament and the third prizer in Greek Roman competitions and decided to focus on the free struggle.
It's been a long time since we've been talking about a new phase of our career that our weight will be in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll tell you more: Machov may be at the world championship in Tashkent if he wins.
But the crucial word is always behind a coach headquarters headed by Goga Koguashville.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose personal strength could shake everything around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
An anesthesiologist, an anesthetist, devoted his career to freeing the sick from both suffering and suffering.
Among those who approached him was his wife, an MI-6 officer, who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while the doctor was engrossed in diagnosis and disease, those who received treatment were mostly concerned about something else -- pain.
Once in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
When he was struggling with flulike symptoms, he found that he resented his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he remarked.
When Juliet left for the week, Lawson found out he was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to X-ray the chest.
Just two weeks earlier, he had skied in the French Alps.
The X-ray results are here.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it's hard to figure out the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer users have been able to smoke.
But it's different with mesothelioma.
In almost all cases the reason is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called "miracle," but which is now known to be deadlyly dangerous.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be overlooked.
Asbestos is, after all, material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industrial recommendation came into force.
Even when used, only individuals from specific industries worked closely with it: those who worked in the pipelines, construction workers, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another age is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But this calmness is wrong.
Britain appears to be at the height of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
There's more people dying from mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die from this disease as from automobile accidents.
Annual death from mesothelomy since 1980 and projected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we feel that it is deadly now is that, while the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually prohibited by law in 1999), mesotheliomas usually go on for decades.
And the invasion of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans in industrial construction.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, placed in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not focus on the class, level of wealth, profession or age.
The elective bastions, from the fashionable London department store to private schools, turned out not to be saved.
The Parliament building is inundated with asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have proved to be the reservoirs of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't an insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he might be in contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It is said that there might have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in Guya Hospital, where I spent six years in internship," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and trucks - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question that, unfortunately, he could provide a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who have been trained in Guya Hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelomy over the last five years,” he said in a letter in 2010, “I was the only one who survived.”
How many of us will get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with "mesothelooma" when he was 48 years old.
When he died, on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live so long.
Fifty percent of Mesothelioma patients die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are going to get this same disease?"
Professor Julian Pito, a leading expert on mesothelomy in Britain, says that it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't know what they're going to die like this anymore.

The rapid review of courtroom reports, where victims often seek compensation, shows how widespread mesothelioma has been.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen had been unsupervised in contact with asbestos.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running two clothing units, one of which was the chief store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before this happened," she said, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't have thought I'd be affected.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance but a group of six minerals.
They are named after the word "asbestictiform", which means a fiber structure that communicates strength and flexibility to them.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is more common in buildings today.
It was used in bloody panels, indoor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boilers, even brake wells of cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is nevertheless recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as “a serious source of health damage”, which can lead to death.
However, brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (croquidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there are substantial, though indirect, grounds for believing that this is the main cause of the extremely high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom]”.
Marks & Spence was exposed to asbestos at the company’s main store in Oxford Street, London, Alami
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelomy victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known impact on work or at home, was probably caused by asbestos from the environment”.
Most of these effects, he says, are due to the “normal use and impact of the weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Conventioning Report, which considered Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the very center of government, might have been exposed unknowingly.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees had been contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be activated as harmless as “strong air flows”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems true.
Although the Parliament Technical Services Authority insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “clean sanitary certificate”, it now recognized the need to work on . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Goddard report noted that “the asbestos situation was not governed by various rules”.
It is not possible to know whether this management error will cost your life.
All you can do now is wait.
One who has never been able to detect his contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practice doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, aged 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he was working in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital that had successfully been brought up with asbestos claims," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day early in December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late at night.
Suddenly, I started to get angry.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from a pleura, a covering around the lungs.
But like Janice Ellen, he just had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
After all, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took X-rays of the thorax and put pleurial catheters to extract the liquid from the lungs and send it for analysis.
Yet, his condition was not diagnosed.
His health has gradually improved, and he has returned to work.
From time to time, however, the same symptoms returned, often after he was active in sports and breathing heavily.
In 2011, a patient named Abbott came to his home with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with “mesothelooma”.
Yet, even then, Abby did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was ten years older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated again, and his consultant showed him the results of the CTC and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera - equipped sensor was placed in a strip between his thorax and the lining of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
I didn't worry too much about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year's: "I've been told it's mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott got caught up in a meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of whom asked him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
"It turns out asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where quite often asbestos thermal insulation was on pipes," he said.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, Mesothelooma now strikes younger people with unusual occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that patients will be affected.
But many staff members who went through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
For decades after the war, hospitals appeared to be a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for the patients but a place that threatened the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
School students set their Bunzen burners on asbestos bearings
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbesthet was often used in offices, shops, libraries and mayors because of its remarkable isolation and fire resistance.
Schools, too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in their class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, school children set up their Bunzen burners on asbestos soles.
Websites have emerged that highlight the problem of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, harmless things, such as the plastic stove or the roofs of the sheds, were usually used to contain asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that's laid in a lot of our constructions," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guya Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful to sleep in garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis when it is known that the disease is incurable, ogroman.
"It takes quite a while to realize this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I was going to have to go and sort myself out.
Well, I'm not meeting Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor to a patient.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information he should have received.
"It was hard to understand," he said.
"I asked my doctor, 'How long do I have?'
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not gonna meet Christmas again.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous, because it is the mechanics of how we sustain life -- the act of breathing itself -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can be stuck in the plough, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers are irritable and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is caused by the inhalation of the needle fibers of asbestos," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guya Hospital in 2001.
It is the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading mesothelioma treatment centre.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably exposed while in hospital.
When the needles of asbestos fall into the lungs, says Treger, "they are pushed into the field where the lining is located by breathing.
This is essentially an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatments for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is a source of heated controversy.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treger doesn't agree.
"It's impossible to cut a pleura," he says.
You can't go around her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is "not very good for chemotherapy" that does "act" but does not cure.
"There are some long-lived patients at times," says Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.
Two-and-a-half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a single support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Allo, Cancer Central," he said happily when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
He first offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "suffered to give only a little more positive color."
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Laszunski, a professor of thoracic surgery at Gaya Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," Graham admitted.
The average patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money is crucial for those with mesothelioma to obtain the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment is finally not effective, many patients are faced with another financial concern — the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fish Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," said Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small quantities could put health at risk.
It was then that they talked about the integrity of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guya Hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a full-cost settlement, according to Morgan, because Lawson was unable to prove clearly that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at the Guya Hospital.
Following an investigation into his death, the representative of the Gaya hospital nevertheless confirmed that “asbestos in the basements referred to had been removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, tying the death of asbestos to one company or place of work — usually decades after that — has proved to be a major problem for patients with mesothelioma that require compensation.
Many of their former employers changed ownership or closed.
Insurance records could be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that there is no time on their side.
In response this year, serious new legislation has been issued to facilitate the recovery of compensation for patients with mesothelioma, even if their former employers cannot be tracked.
The Act established a 350-million-dollar insurance-funded fund for those who have been diagnosed since July 2012 and who can prove contact but who cannot be tried.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court might be able to award in the ordinary compensation case, about ?120,000.
About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, as many people who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that the 350 million constitute “very good work” for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, implying that the sum is a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if they hadn't intervenedd temporarily and those with mesothelioma could track down companies and file a claim in an ordinary way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “unfulfillable”.
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that with seven people dying every day, rapid action was necessary.
"People are suffering so much, and they need help today," Penning said during Bill's second reading of the Mesothelioma last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loick Lange-Lastunski for 19 months.
After primary consultations, Lange-Laszzunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lanj Lazdunski could boast 40 per cent of survivors in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
"This, of course, is one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some power that's backing you up.
When you give up, things can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott was in surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The subsequent scans did not show a trace of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few marks in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a life threat.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no sign of tumors now.
However, this process is both physical and emotional.
You can think of practical things like finance when I die, for example, or what I need to show my wife how the timer works on a boiler.
When you get the bad news, you get sad.
We need to look ahead.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamzin, aged 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for your parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I won't live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin's very social and energetic.
She told all of her friends, and many of us received a phone call very quickly.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such discussions are something that all cancer patients face.
But for those with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by a perplexing possibility of survival.
The disease carries with it (even as Stephen Jay Gould eventually does) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma does not constitute a threat to life.

Major asbestos mines are being opened in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in the Americas, Italy and Russia.
It's the perfect thermal insulation for steam engines and the Industrial Revolution turbine.
The global production of asbestos is increasing to over 30,000 tons per year.
Prudential statistics identify premature mortality among those working with asbestos and who are therefore denied life insurance.

During the Second World War, shipbuilding, one of the most deadly professions in terms of contact with asbestos, is developing intensively.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health harm caused by contact with asbestos in Britain.
The world's asbestos production has grown to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
Great Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in Britain requires that all asbestos contractors be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in Britain.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesotheli Act has been adopted in Britain.
A compensation scheme of the amount of £350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose its leaders; protesters swear revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
This is likely to trigger the long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People's Congress essentially allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't deceive our expectations, but it does make us angry," said legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
This isn't what Beijing promised.
They deceived Hong Kong people.
And obviously we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
The defense decision of China, Lee Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the All-China People's Congress, said that allowing the popular election of Hong Kong's leader would be too “haothical”.
Since 1997, when Great Britain transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to vote as head of Government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives Hong Kongs the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a commission to nominate candidates strictly controlled by Beijing.
Under the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was made after summer when one of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong over many years.
Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which the organizers threatened to close the financial district of Hong Kong unless Beijing guarantees genuine universal voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central were gathered under rain in front of the Hong Kong Government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise in protest in the following weeks.
However, they did not provide details, evidently seeking to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of taking over a central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and no other option is available.
It is with great regret that we report that, to date, all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the central area will no doubt take place.
The public authorities in Hong Kong prepared for Beijing ' s statement for several days, and on Sunday at Government headquarters, security measures were strengthened through the use of police and barricads.
Many people in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
Inflows from the mainland increase competition in goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong ' s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations are at risk of business, a source of life in Hong Kong.
"The test they're talking about, it can cause significant economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long," said the legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
It's an image that's harmful to investment.
The Chinese State media have also reported in recent days on which Hong Kong democratic activists have been shown to be combatants sent by the Western Powers.
During the summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of demonstrations took place in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American prom culture reaches university level: first-year students were offered to come on a personal plane
We're happy to respond to this demand by launching Britain's first "lux" travel service for current students.
In order to leave a strong impression of coming to university, the company also offers transport options such as a personal plane, Rolls-Royce Pantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also said that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their things across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping students this year get to university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
The representative of the company said that since the service had just been launched, no orders had yet been received but added that “students would order the service in the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that despite the fact that students had to pay $9,000 a year for education, it hoped to find a market for that service.
The current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students criticized this service as isolated from reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NPO for Higher Education, said, "This project seems incredibly isolated from the lives of most students.
Many university students this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis where affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants does not meet the rapidly increasing cost of basic needs before they can begin to think at all about removing thousands of pounds for something like simply coming to the dormitories.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
An unarmed youth was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come stand up and say, "Rooks up, don't shoot" while they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, involving the murder of Michael Brown's unarmed teenager, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the Internet conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments placed gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions increased in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the responses of white women, who concentrated 100 per cent on race.
In comparison to the reaction of black women shortly after the assassination of 9 August, personal essays with titles such as “Ferguson thoughts on the behalf of a white woman” and “Feminism is not only about oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis that we're faced with, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so racially related, they felt they should be pointed out.
For a professor of English at the University of Ohio, Corita Mitchell Ferguson revealed the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as “women's issues” in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'll get 150 swearers all over the place," Mitchell says.
When I write something about color people being attacked in their own country, silence makes me deaf.
"Why are women safe to talk about relationships, but not about public safety?" she asked.
For black women, like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share those problems; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women are now uniting issues of race and gender in the Feminist Mainty, Angela Hetter, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"In 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and rape of a white woman almost always was the basis of this," he told.
I needed a white woman to confirm the story to justify lynching.
From Hetter's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white Sufragivists, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for electoral rights would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in the women's vote basket, and the Blacks' right to vote was to come later," Hetter said.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women had attained voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchings with the South Women ' s Association for the Prevention of Lynchvani.
Almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, this group appeared, says Mitchell.
From Mitchell's point of view, the rise in reactions from white feminists to the problems raised by Ferguson's situation - police behaviour and racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to “take care of” the problems that black women had dealt with in several generations.
"Yes, it would be great if activists who have such [traditional feministic] ideology took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do to the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
A prominent white feminist activist, Gloria Steine, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, used Facebook and published a cutting article by Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take part in more protests about racism.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason for understanding the dangers of the body - and views on racial issues, which are significantly different in public surveys - will be at the head of change," wrote Stynem.
Although Stynem is fighting for more overlapping feminism, which includes both problems of race and gender, her comments on race in America are still surprising to some.
A researcher at the American Institute of Business, Christine Sommers, author of "Who Stealed Feminism?", said that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, "are more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's footnotes about Ferguson contradict the criticism she had previously expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, "Look out for my brother", to help vulnerable black- and Spanish-speaking boys, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steine.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that promotes the front line of traditional feminism.
Following the arrest by the U.S. Border Guard of some 63,000 minors on the south-west border of the country this year, immigration reform has returned to the surface - this time the problem of women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that she had only to share the stories of immigrant women in order to present the problem as important to women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued [to male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in positions that are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are answered by women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich's house is sold with pigs.
The picture of a house set up for sale in Saffelka was removed by real estate agents when it was shown to be a large pig resting in the living room.
A separate house with one bedroom is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was characterized by a photograph of the living room - a pig with a head resting on the couch.
Connells' Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the photograph was the homeowner's favorite.
“However, the photograph has been placed by mistake and has already been removed”, reported the representative of the company.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former Assembly House as "a unique separate house with a single bedroom."
Although the agency removed the photo from its website, it was still in advertising.
The sale of homes aroused interest in social networks, where some asked if pigs were sold along with the house.
Russian tennisist Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of US Open, Karolin Woznitski, feels that she lacks stability.
According to the sportswoman, she wants to finish the year and try to get to the new level, handing over Vasili O.O.S.V. from New York.
How do you generally evaluate your results at the Greater helmet tournaments this year?
Of course I'm glad I won at Rollan Garros.
As for the three other tournaments, I did not have enough stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't even get to the fourth.
What tasks do you set before the end of the season?
I have a lot of motivation after a beating.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year.
The Asian tour series begins in a couple of weeks.
Member of the Committee of the State on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nicholas Walouev, suggested that the TEAP should be given bonus when entering university.
He said that, in general, the standards would be the same as those of the Soviet era, and people would pass the standards on retract, run and other exercises.
We will recall that 12 Russian entities will start implementing TEAP standards on their territory as of 1 September.
I also encouraged school students who gave up TEF to give bonus when they went to college,” Waluev noted.
For example, they could add some points to the EGE.
There are also proposals to provide additional terminations to employees of enterprises who have undergone these sports tests.
In Harvey, South Wales, there was a new millionaire after winning the lottery.
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
There is a search for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million from the lottery game on Saturday night.
The Harvey Newsstand brings gold at the top of the prize for the second time in five years, last winning $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to be declared himself.
The owner of the bench, Steve Forvard, said that the win-win had caused a frenzy in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought it might be a secret win.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the prize-winning prize last month, noting the completion of several good weeks for state players.
Last week, the Canning Veil player became one of the five million million people in August, following a huge $7.5 million winning couple from Belmont just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple have been playing for 20 years and have reported that winning has given them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey millionaire brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total benefit of $85 million.
The minidevelopment wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market.
This week, the Minéconomé will introduce into the Government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, as described by the Director of the Department of the Ministry of Oleg Ploniki, on a round table held by the “Knows” on the Moscow Autosalon - 2014.
The plan had been commissioned by the Government and one of the main objectives was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document was expected to be adopted at the end of September - early October, he said that the proposed measures related to electric vehicles and hybrids - there was already a plan for the development of vehicles on gas motor fuels in Russia.
The plan (the copy is available from the "Kids") is for 2014-2017.
The criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport and how to promote the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles are to be developed.
A report to the Government describing tax and customs support measures for electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a concessionary loan and concessionary lease scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce car prices, stimulate localization and establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to amend regulations to facilitate the construction of a charging infrastructure (in parking, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to make proposals to the regional authorities during 2015 that they should also encourage the use of clean transport - in the form of the provision of advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and, by February 2016, in the form of proposals to increase public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Mineconomy will have added criteria to the list of indicators for the assessment of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of support for cleaner transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is only being formed - in 2013, about 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty for electric vehicles was empty, so sales would be about 500, predicting the main executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric vehicles any visible: in 2013, in Russia, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million cars and light commercial cars were sold.
For the time being, only Mitsubishi Motors are imported into Russia by electric vehicles.
The import is being prepared by Renault, a company that focuses primarily on corporate clients, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships Renoot in Russia, Nicolas Remis.
Most other electric transport producers, however, have taken a waiting attitude towards Russia.
Russian producers also have "", GAZ, "", but the output is tiny.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to ASM Holding, AVTWAZ released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low because of the cost of electric vehicles, recognizes the director of the autoWAZA engineering department, Sergei Amani, without a lordly breakthrough in this segment...
The development of the Russian market for electric vehicles, in addition to the expensive machinery (the electric vehicles sold in Russia, on average, twice the cost of internal combustion engines) is limiting the indevelopment of the charging infrastructure (the gas station units), and the director of the autostat, Sergei Scelikov, sighs.
Due to the costly and low rate of reduction in the cost of electric vehicles, Mikhail Travelanski is expected to remain a niche segment of the Russian market over the next three to four years.
On the other hand, manufacturers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional vehicles.
The Russian market for electric vehicles has good prospects, and above all, to inspire confidence in consumers that “electricity” is real; this will be facilitated by, inter alia, the emergence of new charging stations, as stressed by the President of the BMW group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented by, for example, the State Company Rosnets: Moscow has built several stations, and about 80 more will soon be available.
Negotiations are under way on the construction of a gas station network with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofiin, director of Rosset, the company believes in the electricity market and is willing to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging different brands of electric vehicles.
In addition, Rosnet, as a network company, has no right to sell electricity, and the opportunity is being explored to do so with regard to the charging of electric vehicles.
The Pankov considers the most effective measure of lordly support for the establishment in Russia of the market for electric vehicles to be the clearance of customs duties.
The zero rate will continue until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it, or expanding the grace list, is being explored.
The replacement of the transport tax on environmental (the idea is discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, says Pankov.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, in contrast to Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sale of electric vehicles - now accounting for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for car owners, such as free parking in the centre of the city (as already done in Moscow), sure Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles along marked lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private aircraft crashed in Colorado
Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado, U.S.A.
Three of the five people in it are dead, passing on ITAR TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident took place a few kilometres from the airport runway of Denver.
The causes of the tragedy are now being determined.
In Donetsk province, prisoners of the Donbas Battalion are being dealt with.
The guards were surrounded by Ilowaysk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of soldiers were killed under fire.
Survivors say that if they knew what the real situation was in south-east Ukraine, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners are lucky.
The Donbas Battalion is still alive after the meatmeat they were caught under Ilowaysk.
In the vicinity of the Donetsk People's Republic army, the militants spent several days, effectively abandoned by their commanders and the Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from headquarters that the ring could be removed from the alleged corridor, the column moved.
But literally in a couple of minutes, there were shells and bullets on all sides.
"The judge of the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed out," says the Deputy Commander of the Battalion with a call for "Lermonts."
And when we went down the valley between the Multi-Polis and the Redselkie, a cross-fire began with anti-tank-controlled missiles, with “traps”, 30-millimetre grenades, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me, and there were three cars behind me, and then there were only two cars left.
The officer with the Leermont call relates that almost immediately, at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, many died later.
Survivors are now being treated by those they've come to kill.
Now prisoners are surprised that so-called "terrorists" treat them well, provide food, medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and sentenced them to death.
We were simply betrayed, they say.
The entire battalion, so they can destroy it.
As with many of his companions, Alexei was a volunteer in the Donbas battalion because the Ukrainian news reported atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east by “separatists”.
Alexei's already seen a different picture.
His mother in Luganska was killed, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that mortar fire was coming, that it was most likely the Ukrainian armed forces, as one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We weren't released from Ilowaysk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already made arrangements with the commander, and the report has already been written about the departure.
We were taken to Ilowaysk from the congregation fees with Zurahova.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in the "cottle" of Ilowaysk.
Some survivors now admit that if time could be turned back, they would not join the punitive battalion for anything.
All the prisoners were handed over to the DDP forces.
Everyone is checked for involvement in war crimes.
A food price limitation headquarters has been established in the region
A headquarters has been established in the Krasnoyar province, which will limit the increase in the prices of products on the market in the region, if necessary.
The decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the province ' s Government, representatives of the executive branch and the oversight agencies.
Together they will monitor agricultural prices in the province.
Vesty Economy – Will Kiev pay $140 million in damages?
Igor Sechin, head of Rosnefti, stated that the company estimates the damage caused by the shooting of Lisichan NPAs in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported it in an interview with Spiegel.
“We estimate damage of $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government for compensation,” said Sechin.
According to him, the modernized Lisichan NPA was planned to enter into service in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting, there were no "unscraped rebels," but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
Also, there was a missing technological oil pumped into the pipes," he said.
We will recall that on 18 July, in connection with the shelling of the Lisician NZ, the oil storage tank was burned down and two warehouses were destroyed.
The Lysician NPO, the main refinery in Ukraine, was first introduced into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichan NPA is about 7 million tons of petroleum raw materials per year.
The plant is able to produce the fuel of the Euro-4 standard as well as the diesel batch of the Euro-5 standard.
In March 2012, oil supplies to Lisichan NZP were suspended owing to its loss.
The company decided to start repairing.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichan NIP along with other Ukrainian assets from TNC-XB.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Japan Sea.
According to South Korean media, this occurred around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
As told by Interfax in the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, it is believed that the rocket fell into the Japanese Sea after flying some 220 kilometres.
Rubber falls against the background of geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar increased by 3 cop to 37.15 roubles, the rouble fell to a bi-currency basket in the face of geopolitical tension.
The dollar exchange on ETC was initiated by transactions at borders of 37.11 to 37.2 roubles/$1, an average of 37.16 roubles per dollar in two minutes./$1, which is four cops above the level of the previous closure.
The euro rate was 48.79 roubles per euro, which was 3 cop above the level of the previous closure.
The price of the basket was added by 3.5 cops and amounted to 42.395 roubles.
The US dollar is traded by 23 cops above the official rate, and the euro by 16 cops above the official rate.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but this time there was no panic.
He continued to make it cheaper and rouble and even updated the historic dollar maximum.
Now investors are already playing a long way in terms of the deterioration of geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
For the time being, however, it's more like artificial hysteria blown through the media, especially Western ones.
The options for introducing new sanctions on the Russian Federation are not many.
Teletrade "At the opening of the Moscow Rubl Exchange, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, unless we see a new negative soon, both Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
The Orenburg Airlines will be tried with the Ideal Tour.
The Orenburg Airlines filed a claim for a total of 4.7 billion roubles.
These are two cases that will take place in October.
There will be different judges to hear cases.
According to Interfax, the first claim was filed on 14 August.
Its sum is just over 425 million rubles.
It is scheduled for 7 October.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
Its sum is 4.24 billion rubles.
It is scheduled for 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Union, industrial tours have been assigned different cases.
In July, the “Ideal Tourism” debt to the “Orenburg Avillions” totalling 1.5 billion roubles was reported in the media.
The airline director, Victor Zukin, speaks of a sum of 1.6 billion roubles.
Vitaly Savelev's director of "Aeroflota" calls it an even higher amount, two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to get more interesting for new users
Twitter micro-blogging has changed the process of user registration to involve new participants more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their micro-blogging.
New Twitter users will now be looking at a large number of accounts recommended by the service at the time of registration to form their own readership.
The recommendations shall be made on the basis of the interests indicated in the registration.
Twitter automatically checks all automatically selected accounts for subscriptions.
That's why the user's gonna have to hand-picked so he doesn't read to those who don't.
If previously only recommended users saw microblog users, Twitter now prints a sample of one of the blogger's popular Twitters to help make an impression of the human being.
It's the biggest change in Twitter registration over the last three years.
Twitter has been actively working on the modernization of the service lately.
This activity is primarily linked to ongoing attempts by the service to achieve a win-win approach.
In 2014, the microblogging service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a decline in the activity of readers.
The company now desperately needs more loyal consumer resources, which, once in a while, would remain long.
Only in this way can there be a steady flow of advertising tools.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be smooth and rainy.
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy all day, reports meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow is between 16 and 18 degrees, and in Podmoskovy - 13 to 18 degrees.
When the weather is clear and clear, it will rain in the weather, and the wind in the east quarter will be relatively weak - only three to eight meters per second.
Vehicle reclamation programme resumed on 1 September
Since 1 September, the car recycling programme in Russia has been re-established.
Ten billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose until 31 December 2014.
The head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, Denis Mantourov, explained that money was allocated from the limits already delivered to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redeployment from other areas of support.
The programme will cover all vehicles over six years of age.
The amount of compensation will range from 40,000 per car to 350,000 rouble per truck.
In the past, Russia had a similar car recycling programme.
The main difference between the current project, the Minister explained, is that it is now envisaged not only to dispose of the vehicles for the subsequent discount, but also that if the car has reached the age of six years, to acquire a new discount at the time the old one was placed in the Trade-in dealer's office, the Interfax is passed on to the dealer.
The previous federal recycling programme, which was in effect from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, had spent more than 16 billion roubles.
As a result, car production in 2010 was about 1.2 million (that is plus 101.4 per cent compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game of modern journalism.
Heimsainer Nikki Case, famous for playing Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game of modern journalism.
He told me about his project in a Kill Eight interview.
Case started work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has been widely known only now.
The game was inspired by events in Ferguson, where protests began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be on how information coverage of stories affects their impact.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will have to take a picture of what is happening in areas where police-public clashes are taking place.
The hero can take a different picture of what's happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he films the scene so that the police appear to be heroes and the protestors are bandits, the police will start treating him better and letting him go where the ordinary person can't go.
If he highlights things differently, his photographs may turn peaceful protests into a major rebellion.
The points in the game will have to be dialed with a Twitter of the hero, where new subscribers will appear if the photographs presented there are popular.
The game has not yet been named.
The date and platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how the event can change depending on how a photograph of it was taken and processed.
In an interview, Kill Eight Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for quite some time, but initially wanted to devote it not to protests in the United States but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, he realized that he lacked knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media covering the events in Ferguson, he decided to play on the basis of what had happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
The most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which describes events in Case's curriculum vitae, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to tell homophobic parents about his relationship.
Heletei drags Ukraine into the blood
The call to prepare for the next “ten thousand” victims by the Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Valery Géletey, draws the people to the continuation of the bloody struggle, says a communication from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Göletei, who stated that “the completion of the operation for the liberation of the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the Great Domestic War, which would be counted as “ten thousand”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military agency, which published the post on its Facebook page, a subject for research not in the military field, is stated in a report by Russian diplomats.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Ukrainian Minister of Defence wrote on Monday: “The Russian side has threatened several times through informal channels that, if resistance continues, they are prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
In doing so, he stated that the “operation on the release of eastern Ukraine” had been completed.
Perez Hilton removed all intimate images of the stars and apologized.
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars are terrified.
The hackers hacked the primitive passwords into iCloud in smartphones, and then their intimate images appeared on Perez Hilton's blogger website.
It's true, not for long.
Recall that Jennifer Lawrence, the official of the Star of the Famine Games, has already reported the theft of photographs from her cell phone, and he has confirmed that all the pictures that “sow” in the Network are genuine.
Perez Hilton, the creator of a single-name tabloid site, apologized to the actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues in the shop for publishing their frank images, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
Their agents didn't contact me.
And now I'm going to remove the frank pictures of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," wrote a blogger on Twitter.
However, all the frank images of the stars have already spread over the network.
David Beckham was involved in an accident, hiding from Paparazzi
David Beckham was involved in a motorcycle accident, sleeping from Paparazzia.
This happened in Los Angeles at the turn of the Sunset Bulvar.
The British football player broke apart by spraining and stretching the muscles of his right hand.
Beckham came out of the daddy Salon, where he was expected to be a paparazzi.
Fleeing from their persecution on his motorcycle, he failed to manage and fell, writing TMZ with reference to sources close to football.
As a result, Bekham was hit, and the muscles of his right hand were stretched and scratched.
Tony Stuart suffers from an accident when he returns to the track
Tony Stuart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart hit the wall a second time after his right front tyre broke into 172 circles, ending his performance.
Stuart took his stuffed car to the garage and then went out without talking to the reporters.
The leader of his team, Chad Johnston, said that the 14 members of the team were upset but would now focus on the next weekend race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a more successful attempt and a more successful finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and I hope we can do better there.
Stuart first hit the wall earlier on Sunday night following a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repair on the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty good hope of coming to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "just didn't work."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded onto the truck, and the team was ready and ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Spring Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during a ground route race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to take part in the persecution.
He returned to work during the investigation of the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went on the road to complain to Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities indicated on Friday that the investigation of the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
No decision was taken as to whether Stuart would be charged.
The three - time champion was greeted by loud shouts and applause as he was presented before the race.
Starting from position 12, Stuart walked at the first 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching position four.
Then 122 circles after Bush's restaurant.
The car 18 got off the track towards turning 2 and hit Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart continued, but got behind 21st position.
Sovczak and Vitorgan have cigarettes with Zwanecki in Odessa.
Xenia Sobčak and Maxim Witorg are now in Odessa, which the television conductor has not failed to report in her Instagram.
True, one photograph surprised and confused the couple.
The picture's taken from Zwanecki.
"At breakfast at Mikhail Mikhalić Zwanecke Maxim explains what an instagram:) #Odessa," signed the photograph of Xenia Sobčak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, buns, butter, etc.
The couple decided that Ksusha was smoking too, and they condemned her for it.
"Whose cigarettes? "Court Kills!", "What's a cigarette breakfast?", "It's like breakfast, and only cigarettes)) ", "Kseniya, do you smoke too?" -- excited about their favorite followers of her blog.
Remember, Sobczak recently boasted about the delicious meal he had prepared for her for the first time in her life.
"Happily, when you come to the cottage, and your husband has prepared dinner for you (for the first time for married life, which is good for you.) "It's important not to say at the end of the meal, "that it should be so every day," and boasted of being the husband of Xenia Sobczak.
You can see from the picture that Maxim is working hard on something, and there's salt and baked chicken on the table.
The prison officers of Bulgaria conducted a national protest campaign
Hundreds of prison officers from all over Bulgaria had carried out a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in Sofia, the capital.
During a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for a return to their former working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Salaries are also included in the list of claims to be discussed with the Acting Minister of Justice, Christ Ivanov.
During the month, officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the prison service union has met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, the agreement has not been reached, as reported by the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, as reported by the head of the General Directorate for the Enforcement of Sentences, Rosen Zhelnad.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join in the protest of the Prison Service Union.
The army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Prait (right) appointed the Minister of Defence, Herit Wongsuwan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the country ' s new Cabinet of Ministers, in which more than a third of the positions were held by retired generals or generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was officially confirmed as Prime Minister, following the formal approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the head of the interim military Government.
A 60-year-old military officer who took over power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup of 22 May was the only candidate for the Prime Minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed members of Parliament.
According to Prauta Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations during which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Jinglaq Chinawat.
Officially, Chang-Ocha will be a temporary prime minister, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
in the context of full paralysis of the civil power.
Leaders of major political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military took office, they temporarily arrested the leading politicians of the country, including Prime Minister Jinglik Chinavat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is taking root in 2006, when the army removed Brother Jinglik Chinawat Taxin from his post as Prime Minister.
Both enjoy popularity among the rural population, particularly in the northern part of the country, which has often ensured their success in the elections.
However, many middle class and capital elites have entered the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralysed the country since November 2013.
No one's ever told me it'd be better in the Media salad, I didn't promise you that, the new Palm lassera waitress.
It must be formally acknowledged that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain inviolable.
It's been known for a long time that we're saying "Belgium" -- we're talking about Media -- we're saying "Belgium."
Restaurators like to say in depth that the success of an institution depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There are places that aren't good, they're good, but they're not.
In short, when I sat down at the Palm table, I remembered that there was once a City Café (in honor of the same television program), then a Odessa Mama, and then a Bogole restaurant and a beer friendship.
Now it's beer again, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, it's Belgian.
Only the top of the iceberg — the barstand and a pair of tables — had all the rest of the space left without even a hint of sunlight.
But it's fun here in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, multicolored chairs, instead of windows, televisions where the girls swim.
Belgian institutions in Petersburg have long been out of touch, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of spilling beer (260-300 roubles per 0.5 l) and countless bottles (170-1550 roubles).
The company-positive waitress introduces the menu cheerfully, telling us that "Middies are fatty big seeds," and it should be noted that it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is, the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpectedly.
For example, for whom it has been suggested that a meat roll with a Walloon prune (280 roubles) is actually carpachcho, cut so thinly, that parchment paper, compared to it, would appear to be a substance that is so thick.
You can only feel any taste if you're heating up half a man together.
The salads are worse.
Classical Leszic (260) is best recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: some smelly iceberg that was once cooked with potatoes that were once a long time ago, and that was a waste of Kenyan beans, bacon chips, plus some pickled onions.
You're not going to want to meet anyone with such a lazi salad!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If it was still possible to close your eyes to the immature quarters of the cherries or the overheated shamignons, why would the almonds look as if they had been able to unfrozen and uncooked several times in their lifetime!
I already know that there's a perfectly normal Belomorian dingel!
They're served in pots "in a sauce on your choice" (490-560 roubles per 0.5 kg).
The half a dozen sauces, the white wine, the saltery and the carrots, didn't go straight.
Vegetables are eaten and the aroma is not there, and wine is still a mystery.
But good copper-based fries with home-based mayonnaise.
The chicken water supply here is not a groove thick enough to allow you to decide, depending on your mood, the first or second dish is in front of you, but it's just a nice plumbing soup.
It was said that the rabbit was prepared in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about the rosemary.
On the floor, the situation turned out to be the opposite: Rosemary silenced everything.
It seemed as if this rabbit had been fed in the course of his life exclusively with grassy shrubs, which gave him such an unusual aroma.
But the rabbit's leg was attached to it -- no, it's just a great pear in a caramelized short.
Palm waffles are offered not only sweet but also fat with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce turned out to be an excessive water source and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table asked very informally for a meal.
So we should come back again.
The dollar rate has risen to 37 roubles on news of new West sanctions against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar calculated tomorrow by 10:29 p.m. rose by 26.9 roubles and was 37.02 roubles, the euro was raised by 30 roubles to 48.73 roubles, and the data of the Moscow Exchange show.
The basket grew 28 copies to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached its maximum cost of 36.43 rubles on 19 February 2009 and 37.005 roubles on 3 March 2014.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that U.S. President Barack Obama and German chancellor Angel Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The drying of the rub is long-term, coupled with the euro and the dollar.
The long-term forecast had to do with this, says senior analyst Anna Bodrov.
Everything related to Ukraine will, in one way or another, be affected by the course.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, rumours of military incursion are not confirmed on either side, but the market has proved to be very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news was turned off yesterday.
The week is projected to close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, gas transit through Ukraine is all one chain.
Inflation is also forecast: between 5 per cent and 10 per cent will be added to current prices for autumn.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will soon end, and there will be a vacuum as networks shift to other suppliers.
“Dollar came to the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and came back, there's no great hysteria,” comments the head of the Market Analysis Division, “The Broker” by Constantine Bushev.
It will still be seen whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The Rubl, he said, was severely weakened after the tax season was over, then news went to Ukraine, and last week the CB stated that by the end of the year, it was completely moving towards a floating rate and refusing any exchange rate intervention.
If you look at day-to-day fluctuations, they were no different than the previous ones during this month, they're all scared by the 37 rubles, and they're still an analyst.
So nothing big happened in terms of traffic.
The alarming times for the currency market were, I will recall, when demand for currency rose at the end of January, as well as the third March, when the CB downloaded a record number of currencies.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the yaw relaxing.
First of all, this increase in the revenue from export operations and the competitiveness of domestic producers through higher import costs, says top analyst UPS IC Alexei Kozlov.
The travel of imported goods and services may be negative.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, trigger inflationary pressures and, as a result, cause more expensive borrowing, which, in turn, impedes the country ' s economy.
When it comes to the stock market, the depreciation of rubes has somewhat reduced the price of shares expressed in rubes.
For example, the MBIB index dropped by 1.67 per cent during the Thursday tender, and the RTS index lost 3.27 per cent.
This significant difference in the relative reduction of the indices is due to a reduction of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5 per cent.
The weakening of the rub is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy currency.
As practice has shown, emotions gradually fade, and rubies are partially or completely restored to lost positions.
“We believe we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near 36 rubles per dollar”, says Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years thinking that she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharko-Marie-Tuta (SMT), a group of hereditary disorders that cause nerve damage outside the brain and the spinal cord.
A CMT UK charity reported that the misdiagnosed is a common problem among people with SMTs because there is so little knowledge about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are said to have CMTs that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, unreliable walking, and naked toes.
Patients may experience burnout or pain, and the condition is not cured and progresses, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13 years old, she thought she was suffering from Friedrich's (AF) attack, a condition that was very bad for her to predict.
Rogers thought she would be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and would die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew as a child that I couldn't do what the others did.
I fell every day, and I had more time for everything.
I could never ride a video or a skateboard with other kids, and I was having a lot of fun at school because I was walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13 years old, after several operations to release the Achilles tendon and turn her feet, she looked into the medical record when her doctor came out of the room and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn't be, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, I found information about this state in the library, and I wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and I had the worst panic ever.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my powers in this space.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she knew that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and she asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you've got this disease because you'd already been in a wheelchair."
I think you've got something that poses a much smaller threat to your life.
After several genetic tests, SMTs were found.
"When he explained what SMT is, I thought I pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The U.S.S.S.F.A. has announced a month of information on SMTs to try to draw attention to the disease.
The Washington Zone ' s business tax burden increases as the economy recovers
A restored economy means more clients, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies across the country increased moderately last year, when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington Zone were no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia have collectively paid $27.6 billion in state and local treasuries in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local business increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent earlier, and this was the third consecutive year after successive years, when the accounts decreased, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent more than local taxes, 3.9 per cent more than local taxes, according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernest & Young and the State Tax Centre, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenue in the district, 56 per cent, is taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax revenue is taxed by firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, generates the least tax revenue, proportionately, from entrepreneurs.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to the return to the continuing value of company property, say researchers, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years when growth was less than 1 per cent.
While large states, such as California, New York and Texas, account for a large proportion of these revenues, it seems to be the same in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia combined $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent over the previous year.
However, the recovery of real estate value is not having any similar effect on the growth of State and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes are barely higher than one fifth of the company's tax accounts.
Virginia and District of Colombia pay about half the State and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Colombia, belongs to either the Government or the non-profit organization that does not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay the same services as other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully attributed to the restoration of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs ' incomes also seem to be being adjusted according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared a corporate state income tax of $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income from income tax, most of all in the region.
While trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same speed in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Colombia was the same as the national average of 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was much faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average of 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, there was the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is relatively high - 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia, taxes for state and local entrepreneurs are lower, and generally a more favourable climate for business taxes than in Maryland.
The county was not assessed in the study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation reducing the corporate rate from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its tax revenue targets next year, this law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs even to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington Zone seem to be feeling better and thus pay more State and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid in the form of individual income tax for owners of small businesses - a transitional structure where most small firms are located - rose by 20 per cent in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia last year to $2.4 billion at a much faster rate than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in income from business taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with revenue from State and local taxes rising by 6.2 per cent over the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.
The Washington Zone may, however, lag behind because the decline in federal spending has an impact on the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of the Russian Judo
The judo World Home Championship brought two silver and seven bronze prizes to Russia.
As a result, the Russians have been replaced only by the main competition favour of Japan’s congregated competition.
The tournament in Chelabinsk started on Monday, and the first day he brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
It was owned by Beslan the Wise, up to 60 kg.
However, in an equal final battle against Baldbaatar Ganbat of Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was only one comment received by the Russian.
The second day of the tournament was the most successful for Russia's prefabricated country. Three medals were won on Tuesday.
Mikhail Pulaev was awarded up to 66 kg of silver in male competitions and bronze Kamalu Khan-Mgomedov.
In a final alliance, the Russian gave way to the 2011 and 2013 Japan peace champion Masasi Ebinum.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost his compatriot in the fourth stage, passed through a comfort tournament and became the holder of a bronze prize.
In a women's tournament of up to 52 kg, also up to the third step of the pedestal, Natalie Kuzutin was honored.
In the semi-finals, she lost the active World Cup of Mailinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who was flying the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully defended the title.
In the bronze dispute, Kuzoutin won Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she hoped for.
Once again, the obstacle to Russia’s golden gold was Kelmendi, who had defeated Kusuutina earlier in the European championship.
On the third day in Chelyabinsk, bronze was placed in a piece of prefabricated Russia by Musa Moshkov, who fought in a category of up to 73 kg.
In his fourth quarter, he was offended by the former Moldovan representative, Victor Skovortsov, who is now in favour of the UAE team.
But then the Russian won two fights and became the owner of the prize.
He was performing at the home championship with the trauma of the nunstop he was planning to heal shortly, so he'd take a break in the competition.
As for the ex-Moldovian Squartsov, he and he got to the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots who had accepted UAE's sports nationality, Ivan Remarenko, completed a class of up to 100 kg with bronze.
The fourth day of CMM-2014 also brought one bronze to the Russians, which was conquered by Ivan Niphont, up to 81 kg.
In the heavy battle of the little finale, he won a Frenchman, Alan Schmitt, with a comment from a rival.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at the tournament, but the Russians were traditionally confined to one bronze in a male tournament up to 90 kg.
Its owner was Cyril Question, and Russia’s complete medal was guaranteed: its rival at the consoling finale was a compatriot with Cyril Denisov.
However, the interception did not take place: the opponents of the Question were unable to reach their fathers because of the trauma.
The men's bronze was won by the owners and on the sixth day of the competition, it was placed in a piece of prefabricated pen by Renat Said, who was in the category of more than 100 kg.
In a comforting finale, he won a pure victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus the individual part of the world’s succession came to an end.
On the last day of a tournament in Chelyabinsk, Sunday, the world championships were playing in team competitions.
The two Russian- speaking men and women were among the main applicants for the prize, but as in individual competitions, the women of the beautiful sex were not lucky; they did not reach the medal.
And then the Russian Judaists won the command silver.
In a decisive confrontation, they took over Japan ' s main competition favours, the Japanese team, in a hard fight against account 2-3.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 following the net victory of Khan Magomedov and the left, Denise Jartsov (up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories, Mourat Habachev (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope with their Japanese rivals.
In the same scenario, a bronze match developed in a women's tournament where the Russian prefabricated two-to-one replaced the Japanese two-to-three.
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was present at the team competitions in Chelabinsk and congratulated the male team on the silver at the end of the tournament.
"The second place is very honorable, but I'd like to say that it was obvious that you could be champions," said Putin, who says RIA News.
To lose the Japanese, the judo's parents, there's nothing out of sight here.
But I'm sure you can win them.
The Russian national championship of the world was much better than it was a year ago at a competition of the kind held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals, one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was passed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstian and Mansour Isaev.
We're all big perfectionists, of course.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is part of the eight strongest, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
Even more so in a form of sport such as judo," the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation, Vitaly Mutko, quoted by the champion's press service.
Japan’s collection was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of varying dignity, five of which were gold.
The next world championship will take place next summer in Astana.
Other material, news, and statistics can be found on the summer sports page.
The Joan Rivers Family Hopes for the Best
Joan Rivers is unconscious of arriving in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed the hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from illness.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in her statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai on Thursday following an emergency call that she had a heart arrest at the Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, reports sources.
The doctors deliberately keep her under drug abuse and strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “heavy”.
The response was broad, including extensive Internet support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Everyone can be kings.
To sell the debut album of the Royal Blood group, the new hope of the British year, which led the rock duets out of the clubs straight into the stadiums.
Dueth Royal Blood is on stage for a year, but he's already active for a BBC musical prize, an Arctic Monkeys heating tour, and a New York concert show visit by Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut album, a few months before the release, had received 100,000 orders and the contract for its release was in the portfolio of Major label Warner Music.
In view of the current sad situation in the music market, this is not the new Lana Del Rey, or the new sweet-speaker of the new R'n'B, but the duet of the bull-looking British who played with the volume and intensity that was the last one in fashion a couple of decades ago.
Generally speaking, the first album rates for all the above circumstances were particularly high and had already been justified.
Dueta had taken for granted a name that might have been affected before, except by desperate metalworkers, and the blood of what kings seemed to flow in their veins, too, is understandable.
This, of course, is primarily about the heroes at the last level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood seeks to shake up the stagnant blood of the British year by bringing it to a new height.
It may be too early to predict the success of the enterprise, but something can be confirmed.
A dozen songs in 30 minutes are not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composite gift as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of individual numbers cannot be denied, for example, the pilot single "Out of The Black" is characteristic of the drum band rather than the melodic line.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is easier to knock than to drink.
Also worth highlighting is the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing plate of "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in its title.
But the truth is, each of these songs will sound great at a heavy-year party, but when they're played in a row, they come together in a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it's not necessarily bad, even vice versa.
Royal Blood's power is that they don't claim new Lennon and McCarthy's laurels (faster than Motörehead's successors), but they've brought many rock duts out of the ghettos of the Indies Clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, is designed for stadiums, in a room of fewer than a few thousand people, it is obvious that it is close.
The secret is in part the subtle use of bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format invented at the beginning of the zeros of The White Stripes.
But it's not just about the instruments, it's about the composition of the songs.
The heroes of the zerolings had to struggle to move beyond the post-technical paradigm, with great reluctance to acknowledge themselves not only as epigons but as independent creative units.
The sound of Royal Blad is so powerful and can be heard right now that it has been successful in scratching some of the secondaryity and hardness of music.
And after all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: An online store - and a video producer - and a hundred other things - buys the Twitch stream service for $1.04 billion ($US 970 million).
This news was a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination was natural.
Twitch, based just three years ago as Justin.tv, set out to be a flow service of a general nature, a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their game moments; YouTube for real-time games, according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a film genre where all-knowing people give (mainly, old) processing games, like in "The Mysterious Theatre", is already popular on YouTube.
The point is that YouTube is mentioned often when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with no particular interest, a classic example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from the Executive Director, Twitch Emmett Shire, saying, "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Scoundrel like me who say they'll do better than watch sports, it's hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of taking a joystick.
One thing is to look through your friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she slips through Resident Evil, and another thing is to watch someone else get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are designed for one person today, so watching them without controlling the angle of view on your own may be a recipe for the headache worth Do It Right.
I agree that the high-speed walk where the Rogers of the Bennisters of our electronic century end up playing all kinds of games in record time is fun.
But if you're not talking about the virtuosis of a game or humor, it's unlikely that his channel Twitch will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics know about me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and this is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How does Amazon make it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will turn into Amazon Institute Video as beautifully as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
But Twitch has something that any company would love to have: a bunch of young men that advertisers dream of.
As chapter Twitch Shire said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of the game," and this channel does not offer signs of insensibility, even--oh--like a spectacular sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed in the 2004 terrorist attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to surviving hostages -- almost all students now, parents of the deceased, cemetery supervisor -- the City of Angelov, Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of Mothers Beslan's Committee, Susan Dudiev, who had participated in a special operation by the Ministry of Justice, relates Elizabeth Antonov's Community Correspondent, who worked on a special project.
On their return to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who, 10 years ago, was an adviser to the President for the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with Russian FSB officer Vyacheslav Bocharov.”
What was particularly shocking to me since I was working on this topic is that in Beslan, it's like it hasn't been in the past 10 years.
It is a very painful topic for all who have anything to do with it, and it is difficult for people to agree to talk about what has happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," Antonov said.
A special project has been prepared by a studio of colder & Co., which has been working with a company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to World War I and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
The DPRK launched a short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the Japanese Sea, reports Renhap.
The launch took place around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando Province, on the border between North Korea and China.
The rocket reportedly fell into the Japanese Sea, flying some 220 kilometres, and declared before the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
Member States proposed accelerating the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, these Russians will not be stored on servers abroad as of 1 January 2015
A draft law has been introduced in the State to change the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative framework of the lower chamber.
It was sponsored by Vice-Chairmen Vadim Dygin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Eugenius Fedorov ("One Russia"), Vladimir Parahin ("Right Russia") and Alexander Yushenko (CPRF).
This change, in the view of the sponsors of the initiative, will help to ensure more quickly and effectively the rights of the citizens of the Russian Federation to the security of personal data and to respect the confidentiality of communications and communication networks.
The Act, whose entry into force is hastened by parliamentarians, requires that Russian personal data be stored in the territory of the Russian Federation and processed via the Internet.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, maintain, clarify and extract personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located on Russian territory and to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right by a court decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of Russian personal data legislation.
The law also proposes the establishment of so-called “black lists” of abusers' websites, an automated information system “Registration of violators of the rights of individuals”.
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The draft was sponsored by Andrey Lugova and Wadim Dougin of LDPR and Alexander Yushenko of CRC.
Moneygin and Yushenko are also among the sponsors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who do not have data centres in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent.
Commenting on the draft bill introduced in the State Duma today, the first sub-heading of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, stated that he saw no problem in moving the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
He said that those companies that, by 1 January 2015, would not have their own Russian personal data warehouses in the territory of the Russian Federation would be able to rent them, for example, by “Rostelcom”, which repeatedly said that they were willing to rent their servers and already provide their servers, by Mail Group, from Western companies that are now providing their servers”.
“There are also some independent data centres willing to cooperate in this field,” he added.
“If companies decide to enforce the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problem - they will have technological opportunities for accommodation”, said Levin.
Controversial Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed its concern that, if the bill was adopted, the Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
These include on-line air travel services and hotels.
According to the association, “the bill deprives entities of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data - of the mandatory determination that their recording, systematization, etc. should be ensured only in databases located within the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of where the recording is done, to systematize his personal data.
In that case, it would be possible to choose which territory the actions in question would be carried out.
The adoption of such laws on “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the departure of global services and significant economic losses.
The victim of the ice-water test had her jaw dislodged
Isabelle Roberts of Britain was so loud when her head was poured out of ice that she was damaged by the bone structure of the face.
That test by the teddy bear went to the pain wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she was so screaming during the ice-water test that she put out her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts was so furious when her head was poured out of the ice that she was damaged by the facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I shouted, but when I did, my jaw began to get stuck," she said.
They're spilling water for 20 years.
Isabel Roberts, a second before the accident.
I tried to close my mouth, but he didn't shut, he got stuck, and then it came to my senses that something was wrong.
Then my mother and my sister received the same understanding, and they began to hunt, but I had to be taken urgently to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old British woman was taken to the hospital to correct her jaw after participating in a popular party on Tuesday.
The video was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Over 400 prisoners were handed over to the Ukrainian military
In the Novorossiyah Army, the Ukrainian Su-27 is alleged to have been shot down and the enemy is accused of violating the ceasefire agreement
As of 10 a.m. on 1 September, prisoners were handed over to the Ukrainian side 402 of them, 72 of them wounded and the bodies of 35 soldiers killed.
This was reported to Interfax by a spokesman for the Novorossia Army.
He added that “the Su-27 aircraft, which violated the ceasefire arrangements, was shot down by air defence forces in the area of Mereska.
According to the Agency ' s interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions in shelling the Lugan airport.
The spokesman of the press service noted that the militia had managed to destroy two Ukrainian Air Force helicopters during the night at a field airfield, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
“The loss of life by the enemy - up to a hundred people killed and injured - captured 13 people”, summarized the staff representative.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the “people's republics” of Donbassa announced the transfer of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side as part of the ceasefire.
At the same time, at night, the NDP army, according to the Novorossia Army, “suffered the attempt of the Nazi-Guardians to withdraw heavy equipment from the area of the environment, in violation of earlier agreements”.
At the time, militias reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 troops.
According to the headquarters, the total loss of enemy in all directions (Dontec, Luhansk, Mariopolsk) during that night amounted to five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian troops found themselves surrounded by militias in the Ilowaysk district of Donetsk province.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia requested the leadership of the “people's republics” to release Ukrainian soldiers from the environment.
The NAM has agreed to do so subject to the delivery of weapons and ammunition by the enemy.
The first dozens of troops began to leave the surrounding communities on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion Donbass, Simeon Semenchenko, 14 others left the Kkatla on Sunday night.
In his Facebook account, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are “captured by a regiment of 32 divisions of the Russian Federation and 9 tanks brigades of the Russian Federation” where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of Russia denied reports from Ukrainian military and NATO concerning the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation: Russia will respond if the EU introduces new sanctions
Russia reserves the right of reply aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the imposition of new anti-Russian sanctions, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A report from the Russian Foreign Diplomatic Authority stated that the European Council's “concludation” of 30 August had demonstrated the failure of EU member countries to overcome the inertia with which they supported the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, on the basis of “exclusively unproved allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country”, the agency's website states.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation regrets that, contrary to the interests of its member States, Europe is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening confrontation with Russia.
The members of the Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as the conditions for a full “dispute between the warring parties”, emphasizes the agency.
Also on the agency's website, it is noted that there are no current assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbasa, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has occurred, as well as a growing number of civilian casualties.
We recall that specific proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation are planned for the next seven days in the European Union.
In doing so, EU representatives cooperate closely with United States officials.
It is expected that they will align the measures taken for the period of operation and the degree of severity.
New EU sanctions may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Tricky ways to save on university textbooks
Although the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who is about to move to the second year, has devised a subtle way of cutting costs.
He developed a system to rent books from seniors, offering them nominal compensation so that they could postpone their sale.
"My math study book, which is usually 180, I got on a staff for $10 and a cookie for "Chick-fill-A," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The necessary literature on the last term would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Colleges Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and educational supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet shows and creative ideas like Schroeder's.
The rental of books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use it during the term, and often costs much less than buying it.
Nibo Incorporated, owned by more than 250 university bookshops, reports that the volume of books has doubled since 2011.
Research in the industry shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookshops were rented during last spring's semester, says Vice-President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased from university bookshops, according to the professional association of the National Association of University Stores.
Here's an introductory course on how to make a good deal.
Buying in the Internet store
Sometimes if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you'll see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of Math Analysis, by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hosteller, is worth about $290 on pre-scourant, but a new copy is available for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Buying a used one
If you're not against someone else's marks or damage, the textbooks used are a good option.
“Mathematic analysis” is sold for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Kessadey, 25, a fourth-year-old student at Brigham Young University, says that he paid 42 cents for a copy of the book Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business of Advertising Business.
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the College of Wallless University of Massachusetts in Emhurst, invite students to clarify from their professors whether they should not use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are not essential for classes.
In such cases, older publications are often found for a very small percentage of the cost of the latter.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, which belongs to eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to the purchase of used books.
Leaking
The idea of renting textbooks should be considered if you were to treat them well enough, remember them, and do not want to keep them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of the new book.
For example, one student was able to hire Math Analysis on a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you may receive for notes, notes, and injuries.
If you hire a book, remember that if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of the new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented by electronic licenseers for a certain period, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" on Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Brace says that students studying literature can often find the best prices because many classics can now be downloaded free of charge, whereas literature in science and engineering can be very expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Holt, 29, who is about to begin her studies at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using ISBN to find out the price of the book, since this guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering on the Internet, says Holt, check for the book in the warehouse.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he had acquired was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid a full price at the university bookshop.
Putin stated the total ineffectiveness of the Far East Development Fund
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, showed at a meeting on priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, was ineffective, says Interfax.
“15 billion rubles remain in deposits,” the President said.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested the approval of the list of territories that preceded development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of thetors should be introduced in the State party this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, did not approve by 1 July the list of pre-development areas in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin has also identified key challenges to the development of the Far East.
Among them, increased transport accessibility of the region, removal of infrastructure constraints - both on the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create prerequisites for additional investment in the region, as well as to establish pre-development areas that should become competitive with the APC key business centres, the President stressed.
It was recalled that it had been reported earlier that the pre-development area could replace the EPA.
Why the Galaxy Guards were unable to save cash charges
Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget in the United States, whereas "The City of Sins: A Woman for Whom to Kill" returned only $12 million from his $70 million budget.
"Practical Video" with Cameron Diaz only brought $13.6 million on the first weekend, while children's movies such as "How do you get dragons 2 also disappointed with the proceeds.
An article by the Telegrapher Robbie Colleen shows that when it comes to children's films, it may be about the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colin called 2014 "the worst" year in history for children's movies, and he called "How to hand in dragons of 2 to barely "function" a continuation of the fantasy.
However, when it comes to films directed at audiences of a somewhat older age, the problem does not necessarily seem to be as the film itself.
In July, Hangly compared the average ratings of CinemaScor and Metacritic for each film that ran for at least 2,000 copies in summer between May and 20 July, 2013 and this year.
Results that take into account the views of both movie viewers and movie critics suggest that this year's production is similar to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that it can be about changing spectatory habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services, such as Netflix.
The director, John Fawro, who's currently working on the soon-to-be-pronounced Fresne film "The Jungle Book" said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We need to recognize this and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current fall of the Hollywood cash charges, Netflix's revenue from the stream reproduction service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too heavily on the comics franchise, and predicted Hollywood's crash.
In the light of the current recession, some commentators claim that his grim predictions had a share of the truth.
Since several potential cash hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including the Bridges: Era Altrona, Minionov and Jur Park, other film industry representatives are more optimistic.
Simon Kinberg, producer of "Human X" recently called the fall of cash charges "cyclic," said Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the most cashier in history, and no one will worry about it."
Food sanctions do not frighten the owners of the Caucasus and Middle Asian food establishments, but for European and Japanese kitchen restaurants, Russian suppliers are a nightmare.
In general, the general public still prefers to replace the prohibited imports with products not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“Better is a small cucumber than a bad mosarella” is the Italian restaurant chief cook Barlotti Mariano Valerio for the quality of the cheeses offered by suppliers in exchange for Italian.
Motzarella and cheese burrata ended in the restaurant first, they have a short storage period.
Parmesan supplies should last for a couple more months.
What should I do?
Going to Russia?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomile market.
Mariano Valerio makes such her eyes that it is clear that shocking memories do not release him to this day.
The meat was only eight inches [30 cm] from the floor!
There's cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant, we would never buy anything from Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it changed.
But I got a fish from the Far East for trial the other day.
That's how she's getting sick!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many of Italy’s usual things are for a Russian manufacturer in the wild.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy a Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in the refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1 to 2 degrees.
It's got to hang out to get soft to let the muscles relax.
I did all this with a local beef.
Then they asked me, where'd you get that tender meat?
I said, it's yours.
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
The five-minute walk from Barlotti to the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" has a stop-list on the kitchen that lists missing products: French oysters, seafood.
"Brasserie Bridge" and "Ströck" bar, Regis Trygel, are not as pessimistic as Valerio: the oysters from France have already been replaced by Austrians from Tunisia, and the French cheeses will be replaced by Swiss cheeses.
But Régis is getting more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The color capusto is 200 roubles!
I say, "Why is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make a living."
But that cabbage shouldn't be worth more than 80 rubles!
The Far East oysters we buy by weight, but they live for 15 or 20 years, you know, how much weight does their shell weigh?
At the price, it turns out it's a super-delicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of pancakes for foreign cooks.
Standard story: "The first three months were all right, then the quality dropped dramatically."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibre and quality.
Many restaurants in Europe don't know what's gonna happen to them when the cheese supply is gone.

The Approval Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of separate economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are mainly called food sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and subproducts from domestic birds, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurts, cassavas, cheeses, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrup.
Restaurants began to have a cherries with suppliers: food prices had increased, and it was urgent to look for analogies from other countries.
This will have the greatest impact on expensive restaurants with monocouples in France, Italy, Spain, to which products were delivered directly from “material” countries.
The generals had to be renovated before.
For example, in early 2014, Rosselhozzor banned the import of Australian beef and a year earlier American and Canadian meats.
In return, suppliers set up the supply of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer 2014 sanctions have been much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dimitri Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree that exclude Atlantic salmon and trout, non-cancer milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for planting.
The Italian, Valerio, hopes that the sanctions can be mitigated.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in an uncertain environment.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the final segment was up to 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants will have to change menu to what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergey Mironov, Rector, the owner of RestConsalt.
If the chef's strong, it won't be a problem for him.
We're the only ones with very few of these, and it can take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the Brasserie Bridge is ready to do this: 10-15% of the food will have to be abandoned, half the menu will have to be reworked.
The mixed kitchen restaurants are starting to replace dishes, such as marble beef steak for befstrogans, says Sergey Mironov.
“Claims from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian, Serbian, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, by Oxana Glibchuk, representative of East-West.
Plums and dairy products from Europe have parallels in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the United States may be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seed from Norway - salmon, seed, trout from Belarus and Chile.
Lack of vegetables and European produce can be compensated by domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, it will be easier for budget network restaurants to reshape than for the pre-eminent segment: it is unlikely that there were Gourmets capable of distinguishing the Italian Mozarella from the Russian one.
Although it would be difficult for Ginza Project institutions to do so, he believes.
Ginza Project has dozens of restaurants under different brands and from their menu.
It's gonna take a lot of time to replace," says Mironov.
In Ginza, the comments were withdrawn, referring to the absence of owners in the country.
Caucasian and Central Asian Cafés emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are better than Europeans
But there's a lot of restaurants that won't be affected by sanctions.
These include institutions with CIS kitchens: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive foods in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatuna Kolbay, the owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe "Wai Me!".
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, and we don't use the exotic greens as the basis of many dishes."
No food has yet been removed from the menu in the institutions of Kolby.
Timura Lanski, owner of Chihona N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchens, there's no confusion in the sanctions: he's only going to have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia set up imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we would even gain price, for us it would be cheaper than imports from Europe,” he said.
Cutting, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit may be cheaper from LPG.
However, what is imported from Central Asia is much better than what is imported from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Uzbek tomatoes are known to be delicious, sweet.
No one talks about Spanish.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Olymba Artikov, stated that he planned to increase the export of productive products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Restaurants who responded to Deneg's request also respond quite calmly to sanctions.
McDonald's Press Service stated that localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanov, head of the Subway Russia supplier department, about 80 per cent of the products are purchased by the network in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices of meat products produced from imported raw materials.
The “Temke” had no more than 4 per cent of the “sanction products”.
They didn't touch the sanctions or the noodle Walker.
KFC, Burger King and Little Kartoska did not respond to Daneg's request, but other market participants argue that Burger King's localization is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, Rectors are willing to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East
On his humpback.
Meanwhile, Rectors complain that even local products are increasing prices as demand increases.
“Grabley products have an average price increase of 10 to 15 per cent, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio twice,” says Rector Roman Rozhnikovski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will increase by 5 to 10 per cent, and Colbay admits.
East-West doesn't deny that, "For example, Belarusian milk products have been traveling 10-15% since early August."
"The Brazilian suppliers have raised the price of pork almost twice," complains Sergei Cancer, Deputy Director-General of Stardogs.
The chickens were 35 per cent traveler.
Waiting for China's prices, maybe they'll cool off Brazil's hot heads.
Stardogs will soon have a planned 8 per cent increase in prices.
Now it's very undesirable to raise prices, says Rack.
According to statistics, the increase in the total revenue for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest indicator since 2010.
The difference prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how fast: while most of the reporters are stocked in food for the next two months, in the hope of waiting for the price overruns.
But what's gonna happen in two months is nobody knows.
In front of Moscow’s mayor, there are dozens of tents decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the scene, musicians play waltz.
It's a regional product festival with a funny name, "There's Time."
"We've been going to do a local food festival for a long time, and here's the sanctions, we're in a hurry, we're organizing the festival," says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, the Greek cook Anastas prepares macaron salads and home candy, and the other day there was a master-class for preparing a boar with caramelized apples.
All Russian products assure the organizers.
In the tents is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian people's economy.
The honey from Bashkiria, the deer from Salehard, the vegetables from Lenin's Boom, cheese from the fallen Italian, Jay Clause.
"Fall for restaurants can be replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East," says Philippe Halkin, owner of the fish store.
We've got a kidney, a cat, a boiler, a peacock, a shoal, a king's salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because it's wild fish.
The Norwegian salmon is an aquaculture.
You're taking him in, he's not even moving.
And our Far East salmones will not be held in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian mosarella with a domestic one
In the shade of his tent is shrimps with a jar of Magadan, cod, molasses, flour, copper from Crimea, cracks from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's time to go fishing from the Far East.
According to statistics, fisheries in Russia in 2013 are over 4 million tons, and a large proportion of fish go to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
"His People" has been in operation since 2012, selling fish through the Internet store, serving another one and a half dozen restaurants, such as Simple Things, before imposing sanctions.
Now there are applications from another 15 restaurants.
You can make the same sushi out of our fish, it's hot.
We're frozen, we've tried different recipes.
We're selling sushi through the Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish are a few times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilo.
I'm being prepared for the Filadelphia rescue at Galkin's tent with a cat.
Unlike the rolls of the seed, these have to chew for longer, but the awareness that this fish is ours, our own, is giving us strength.
There are even rolls of paltus and sea perch on the website of "My People's" benches.
In sushi bars, it's true that Norwegian salmon is preferred to Chilean.
Galkin explains this because lavender cooks will come up with new recipes for distant - east fish.
"The Russian fish suppliers have not yet been offered us," gives an explanation to the owner of Killfish Bar Dimitri Eviev.
About the same situation with other products: Russian producers could have occupied a niche that had been released, but that was not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimova project, it is now possible to talk more about importing imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and high volumes.
They can quickly replace prohibited imports with those of our farmers.
That is, the main beneficiaries of the ban will be the major producers of other countries,” Akimov says.
But last month, the restaurant industry received a more disturbing signal than food sanctions.
As a result of mass exceptional checks, Roswannadzor was temporarily suspended by three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg.
“We are examining the nature of the claims submitted to determine the actions required for the early opening of the restaurants for visitors”, stated Dengam in the McDonald's Press Service.
No one really knows what's going to happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, it's one option that can be experienced, says anonymity of a company's consulting firm.
If you start closing McDonald's all over the country, then the script will be different.
“Europrotocol” in place of the GIBD's certificate
Cascot payments will be available without a GIBD certificate, and the CB intends to encourage the introduction of “europrototocol” in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has drawn up draft guidelines according to which, as of 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to obtain cash-in-service payments without a GDSD certificate.
It is true that only cases where the accident has been “europrotocol” without the involvement of the road police are involved.
That is, if only two vehicles were involved in the accident, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the established limit, and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
As of 2 August, the “Europrotocol” payment limit is 50,000 roubles and will be raised to 400,000 roubles from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad districts.
The point is that, often with minor damage, in a situation where accidents can be treated by “europrotocol”, drivers who have been injured cause DFS.
If there was a policy of Kasco, no compensation could be obtained without a GIBD ' s certificate.
The parameters outlined in the draft directive are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of “europrotocol” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment of the helmet in respect of accidents without HYBD personnel should not be lower than the limit for the “europrotocol”.
At the same time, however, it cannot be higher than the limit defined in the Kasco insurance policy.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the DFS and the roads.
But she's not likely to be admired by either the motorists or the insurers.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new policy rules for the payment of the Kasco.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver will in most cases wait for hours for an inspector to report a minor accident because it's more reliable.
And we don't know what's easier to do if we beat the fraudsters or convince the drivers that the Europrotocol is reliable.
The savings certificate will make the name and the irrevocable
Minfin wants to ban bearer certificates, but he's going to let banks make them like an irrevocable contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill that will ban the bearer's savings certificates.
Recently, this tool has gained popularity because the rates are higher than the rates of bank deposits.
The fact is that the bearer ' s savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system and the bank is cheaper because they do not have to be credited to the depository Agency (CAS).
The pictoriality of this step is that it is planned to be taken by small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and will suffer from it by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to ASW estimates, control 98 per cent of the professional market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow is estimated to be about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, as explained in the ASS, is that the clients of a small bank that bought the certificate are trying to get money from the AER if the license is withdrawn.
Some investors may assume that their investments are insured by not having sufficient financial literacy and by purchasing savings certificates from the bearer.
The justified absence of insurance payments for these certificates if the licence is withdrawn from the bank may lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.
In the practice of the agency, there have been cases in which the bearer certificate holders have attempted to recover insurance compensation through the courts”, stated ARA.
The problem is, of course, a mind-blowing one.
There would still be no one to pay certificates to buyers, since they had no legal right to compensation from the State.
If it were true that the instrument was not insured in ASS, it would also prohibit metal accounts in which citizens ' funds are recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and pallady.
Because these accounts are not included in the deposit insurance system either, but they have not yet been attempted.
It is likely that the bearer certificates are a very convenient security, which can actually act as a quasi-dengege.
There is little control over their movement: any bank client can buy a certificate, hand over a certificate to any citizen, and before cashing such a certificate can replace many owners.
It is no coincidence that the bill provides that the savings certificate must be the very security that must be kept in the depository.
In order to send a saw to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without due payment.
I mean, there's an equivalent of an irrevocable contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests were made by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in central Newport on a march against NATO.
And on Sunday at Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff Hall for what was described as anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclau followed us over the weekend and talked to the protesters who had come from around the world, from Bridged to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will deliver weapons to Iraq to counter the terrorist group “Islamic State of”, communicating on 31 August ITAR-TASS, referring to a decision taken following a meeting of FAR Government representatives led by Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Germany is reported to be sending 30 portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The supplies will be delivered by the end of September.
In addition, it has been decided to allocate an additional 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will deliver a government statement on the subject in the Bundestag.
So far, Germany has not delivered its weapons to hot spots.
The opinion of the FAR on the sending of weapons to Iraqis has been divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop members of the “Islamic State” fighting; others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Politemen hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donet militia hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TAS.
It is reported that this occurred in the Gulf of Tagango, near the towns of Chiroquino and Nonamen (10-20 km east of Mariupoli).
A number of Ukrainian media report the shooting of two coast guard boats.
It is clear that the incident took place today at around 4:20 a.m.
Adolescents were taken from the Blue Mountains by helicopter
TWO Bushuokare teenagers were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man went camping shortly after noon on Sunday at Govets Lip in Blackheit.
The concerned relatives called the police about 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team was sent to join the local police and rescue unit, and a couple were found about 11 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with the couple overnight and were picked up on a swan Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition.
Two alliances met
The Minsk summit negotiations did not resolve the problems for which they had been convened but had given rise to a new format: the European Union ' s first people met with the first ones of the future Eurasian Union.
The EU and Customs Union leaders discussed a number of “hot issues” for the first time on an alarming note (the situation around Ukraine has not been delayed).
Whether such a structure can work effectively is not clear; however, it is clear who has taken off the cream from this summit.
Questions in this regard fell back on the evening of 26 August, when Belarusians, followed by other Eurasians and Europeans, saw a new President, Lukashenko, on television.
The Belarusian leader was an example of focused respectability; it was the behaviour of a man who had just broken a Jackpot and planned to grow old in a higher society.
How Maydan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European commissioners (EU Ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to address the final briefing on their behalf is not just the legitimization of the President with 20 years of service.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged actor of European policy and as the main thinker of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Denis Melyantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"That Catherine Ashton has met Aunta-Tat with Lukashenko suggests that relations with the EU will continue to be unfeeled," he said "The Fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: the preparations for a breakthrough by the Belarusian authorities began well before the November Maydan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
“The results have also been achieved with the EU, namely, successful negotiations on visa and readmission facilitation, modernization dialogues,” lists the Ogonca interlocutor, and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The United States even lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them have only contributed to this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, was able to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade - and President Poroshenko was able to come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Russian militias in Donbassa with all severity, did not fight with Moscow either.
Minsk has not withdrawn from either the Customs Union or the CSTO, while Baranović has a Russian airbase.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it - the Belarusian experts are confident.
How successful the Lukashenko movement will be in political diversification will be seen by how often Minsk will soon be able to host EU+TC meetings.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expected of the relationship in the new format.
The Spokesperson, Ashton Maya Kosyančić, merely stated that the issue was not a priority in the context of war and peace.
At the same time, it has been reported that Kazakhstan could be the next place for a meeting on the Ukrainian question, with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The small delegation to Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaev in which he admitted that he was personally asked by the representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, in the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made clear that it is not against all parties that Minsk remains a central venue for meetings, both in Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” will become a well-known European leader who helps to solve the global problem.
A European farmer’s best friend
The composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissions on Trade and Energy, had led to the conclusion that the main basis of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbassa but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future negotiations on gas supply and to address the concerns of the TC countries under the Ukrainian Association Agreement with the EU is more ambitious than the peace declarations without specific dates and numbers.
The Trade Commissioner, Karl De Güht, nevertheless, indicated that EU representatives had “come to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that had economic consequences rather than vice versa”.
However, the crisis in Ukraine appears to be “working” on Belarus.
Its consequences - and above all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk a long-awaited field of manoeuvre, so far under the pressure of sanctions.
According to the head of the Mises Research Centre, an ex-candidate to the President of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanczuk, European investors are actively interested in the capacity of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation, circumventing sanctions.
There are supply schemes for which Vladimir Putin, at the summit, pitted Minsk.
“The originators of these schemes,” said Romanczuk Ogonka, “are not Belarusian businessmen but Russian companies.
They have long worked out supply patterns, including those from Poland, Germany and Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
The Russian business needs to be restored somehow, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies are willing to start production in Belarus of Ukrainian raw materials in addition to the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be very useful.”
According to Romanczuk, the role of the host of the EU and TC negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and for developing economic relations with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agrarian sector from the sanctions of Moscow were estimated at Euro5-10 billion, while the European Commission had now offered only Euro125 million in compensation to the agricultural community.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the effects on Eurofarmers.
This could raise Lukashenko ' s credibility in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality Without an Initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk, by its active role in the birth of the TC+EC format, is revealed, while the Belarusian leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague emphasized that he had initiated a new format and that he had become the initiator of Kiev.
“It was your proposal to meet, without any urge to discuss, not with the barracks bay to take a decision, after signing the EU Association Treaty, to investigate the situation that had been created in Ukraine at the time,” he addressed the cameras to Petr Porosenko.
The observers, however, interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow; it was reportedly initially opposed to Minsk mediation, which greatly increases its political power.
In the Belarusian diplomatic agency, it is stressed that Belarus, in organizing the EU-TC interaction on its land, has no self-interesting objectives and the ultimate aim of such a format is to create a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“This is in the spirit of those concepts that, in other areas, particularly in the area of security, put forward and promoted the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation,” said Ogonka in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, an agency that has recently been scrupulously chosen.
Free entry zones may appear in Moscow
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of free-of-charge zones as a method of controlling the congestion of central roads similar to other major cities in the world, and refers to the Moscow Deputy Transport Officer Maxim Likstov.
One option that has proved successful is that of paying entry.
This is an expert opinion, and we're going to study it, and we're going to look at all the negatives and benefits.
To say that some decision had been made on this matter before it was too early," Liksutov explained.
Zamora stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and load to Moscow, was of great importance to the capital’s authorities.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already under way construction of a central ring road, adding Likstov.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that not all traffic through Moscow is necessary.
If there were enough transit infrastructure, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow,” the mayor noted.
Also, Maxim Likstov stated that the introduction of paid parking spaces had substantially unloaded the capital streets.
And according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to dwell on what they have achieved.
We will recall that on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobian, participated in a bookmark ceremony for the construction of the first Moscow Central Ring Road (CACAD) launch complex.
Fatigue of Sinful One
Frank Miller and Robert Rodrigues film "The City of Sins: A Woman for Whom to Kill" did nothing but revolution.
The first City of Sin (2005), filmed with a minimum but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized between films, comics and literary Nuar.
Sikwell is also revolutionary in his own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental line of thinking today's "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if you mean by the the thesis of the universe, and the antithesis - the cosmos of comics).
It should now read "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
"The City of Sin Two" is chaotic both at the playwright level and at the philosophical level: both times it's chaotic in the bad sense of words.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first City, although Marv (Mickey Rurk), remember, finished his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing can ever be taken away - as that folk wife - from the air of the knives and other axes with favours.
But the old men are literally pushed by the elbows of the newcomers, like they broke into a city from some other movie, about the meaning and story of which the viewers are asked not to worry.
So his story, shamelessly torn by the authors at the most interesting point, is that of Johnny's superb player, Joseph Gordon-Livette.
His own is for the lusty-fried Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for the vengeful Dwight (Jos Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight's face, let's say, is not different from Johnny's -- especially since the faces, like other parts of the body, the characters are subjected to an inexorable regularity -- not trouble or even half a victory.
It's not people, but we realize they're nara archetypes: a rock bitch who's too confident of himself a player who's a sex media trap detective, a corrupt turpentine.
Well, when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and an archetype chases away, it's no longer a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And it's funny to ask abstract painting questions about logic.
Besides, even in this crazy world, there is something permanent.
Warlords from the first City continue to defend themselves in a circular manner against the shadow of their native slums.
And Detective Hartigan's ghost is not-no, and he will look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always happy to see.
The main problem of "The City of Sins 2" is another.
Frank Miller was good at putting a comic book and a nair together as a painter, and as a director, he flipped the idea of how to put comics on the screen.
Comicx and Noir are two aggressively opposite "realities."
The comic book phenomenon was born in the late 1920s, but when the novels of Dashil Hammet’s “blood gravy” (1929), Maltese Falcon (1930) and Glass Key (1931) created the canon of Nuara, then called hard-boiled school, which was called a “cool school”.
Or pop fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood dozens of heroes, from a pophai sailor to a spinach eater, giving him the wealth of power, to Superman, to Batman, and to Dick Tracy's screecher, to Hulk, Tora, Spider-Man, and other "venges".
But in every movie on the basis of comic books, there was something harmful: the figures were stubbornly reluctant to grow the screen flesh, and they remained an act of fads in the environment of their will-to-be "real" world.
Simply put, they were purely deprived of "exclusive."
Noar, on the contrary, is the most exotic genre of the world's literature.
After the wars of the world, the traditional novel -- with experiences, personalities, family scandals and historical background -- lost all credibility.
What kind of Foresights, what are Tibo and Rugon-Macarra, what are even the Bologna and Rostov thinking after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
The novel was peacefully mutated in soap opera, and the criminal - by definition marginal - the novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett found out what it's like to work as a health worker on the front.
He was a communist.
Like, by the way, there were at least close to the company and the pillar of the genre, such as writers Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors of Jules Dassen, Joseph Lauzi, Edward Dmitrick.
So the Nuar, whose archetype they named, first, is rough and cynical, and second, is purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first City of Sins was observed in that it was unnatural but organically connected the comic book to the Nuar.
For the first time on screen, the comic book was relived, not being ashamed of its graphical nature, but acting like a real movie.
The darkness of the selling world, where the cardinal ordered murder and the senator covered a terrible sadist son, was quite worthy of Per Hammett.
And the painted details of a kind of cut-off head, which the sadist used to decorate his nest, the pen of the genius James Elroy, the author of the Black Orchid and the best -- that is, the declarating thinner -- the neonar representative.
The City of Sins 2 is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller's radical style-- Rodrigues before a comic book tradition.
Probably a lot of this happened because of 3D technology.
When you watch the second "Grand of Sins", you feel like you're trapped in a glass ball inside which the snow goes into a toy bed.
Most of the time, though, it's not snow, it's blood marks, but what's the difference?
And there's nothing to be said about socialism.
Because it's possible only if there's a girl on the side of a muddy swamp somewhere around us, but there's a normal world where you can bring back a girl who's down the curve or, say, tell the distraught parents that her killer is being punished.
But when there is no place for sin in the city except sin, then sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
I'm bored, like any other rule.
The City of Sins 2 chaos is boring.
Justice for the sake of domestic corruption has given that little but little glove to this freshwater sin.
Titles warn that the movie contains harmful scenes of smoking.
With regard to maturity, in the most vegetarian episode of which a person’s fingers are broken, this gives hell’s humor.
Hammet would love it.
The socialists of France must "stop and bring France to order," says the key ally of François Holland.
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left-wing forces to “exercise warm affection” towards the socialist President who was under attack, whose movement had not been approved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect; he deserves our loyalty; he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay close to him," he said, calling applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured his Government would not question the disputed 35-hour workweek in France, despite the inflammatory proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Makron, the new Minister of the Economy earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobira, Minister of Justice, put his sticks in his wheels, came to a meeting of dissenting members of Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticized the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost their faith in the future”.
Marin Le Pé, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, expressed contempt for permanent internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not imagine that the new Wall's Government would last longer than a few months.
François Holland is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to gather a new government when the summer did not last.
"And the new one won't hold on in the fall or in the winter," Mrs. Le Pen told the reporters.
It reiterated its party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that it was confident that the party could easily win the early elections and was ready to run.
The ruling party of France experienced a breakdown in the March municipal elections, and the extreme right national front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey of Sunday's Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of French people believed that the Socialist Party was at risk of falling into several competing factions before the end of Mr. Alland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at Xians Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose their patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to feel that something's changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"The City Without Drugs" has no claim
The Swerdlov arbitration court left the Regional Ministry of Public Administration's decision-making authority to the drug-free City Foundation without consideration.
The Office intended to recover over 7 million roubles from the organization as rent charges for the building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the Court of Arbitration of the Sverdlovsk Region has left without consideration a claim by the Executive Directorate of the Department of Public Property Management of the Region (MIGSO) for the "Court Without Drugs" Foundation (one of the founders is the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugenius Royzman).
The regional authorities intended to recover rouble 7.3 million as rent charges from the organization.
It is now known that the claimant did not appear twice before a court, which led to the decision not to examine.
The reason for the absence of representatives from the ICGESO administration was not clear, and the Chief of Legal Affairs, Maxim Titov, did not respond to telephone calls.
The Fund was also unable to contact representatives.
We will recall that this is the mansion, which has occupied a fund in the centre of the city on the street of Belinsk, 19 on a grant basis since 2011.
This decision was taken by the ex-governor, Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the directional authority of the Ministry of Public Property Administration of the Sverdlov region filed a claim with the Sverdlov arbitration court for the removal of the fund from the building.
According to the claim, the agency required that through the court, a grant contract be declared unconcluded by the premises of the monument.
In the view of the management of IUGISO, the agreement did not record substantial terms for the lease of cultural heritage.
The Sverdlov arbitral tribunal dismissed the claim and an appeal was filed with the 17th Permi arbitral tribunal, which was granted.
The fund then filed an appeal against this decision with the same court, which remained unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the fund to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court accepted the management.
In 2013, a new lease contract was concluded, under which the fund began to pay the rent again, as told by Eugenius Royzman, the head of the city.
The rent was paid 300,000 roubles a month.
The region ' s previous administration has turned this building over to us free of charge, recognizing our anti-narcotics merits as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration decided differently," he stated.
Tatyana Droyaev, Ekaterinburg
Why Mayor Ekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, Monsignor Ekaterinburg’s unirosse deputy, Alexander Kosintsov, invited the mayor of the city’s Speaker, Evgeny Royzman, to resign.
A criminal case was brought against the arrested person on suspicion of the murder of the retired deputy of Gorpez Kineva, who was considered a partner of the mayor.
How Evgenia Royzman Found a Criminal Case
On 1 July, it was reported that criminal proceedings had been instituted against the “celevette” (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) on the blog of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Royzman.
This was reported by the Director of the Law Centre “Protection” Anna Filatova, the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Sverdlov region.
According to her, Mr. Royzman accused her of having committed crimes against her ex-wife on her blog.
The Mayor of Ekaterinburg is convinced that "this is a regular attempt to avenge the truth."
The iPhone's gonna turn into a purse.
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple has to present his new developments, there are more and more leaks in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
Referring to sources, the United States media report that the sixth generation of iPhones will be equipped with a mobile purse function as a result of the joint Apple project and the Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Blogberg and the dedicated Internet resource Re/code, on 9 September Apple may, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, which will make the mobile wallet available in the new smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this matter.
This function allows payment to be made on a store account by means of a smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the first use of the NFC (near field communication) technology will be introduced into the iPhone, which allows the payment to be made by means of a smartphone and an appropriate reading device on the cash register.
NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Simiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC function was introduced in 2004 as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Simiconductors and more than a hundred other companies in the so-called NFC Forum, the Association for the Advancement of Technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC-Samsung Nexus S function was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google presented a Google Wallet system that allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with an Android smartphone.
However, American experts stress that despite the large investment of high-technology companies in the promotion of NFC technology, U.S. Ritlers are still cautious of innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores by such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's entry into the market will make the Ritzlers accelerate and intensify the introduction of this technology at their trading points.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France: The position of Paris concerning the supply of Mistralley to Russia is unchanged
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs official Romen Nadal stated that Paris had maintained its position on the delivery of the Mistral type of helicopter to Russia.
" I can recall a statement by the President of the Republic (François Holland) in his interview with Le Monde on 20 August: "The level of sanctions does not prevent delivery today.
This is a decision of Europeans, not of France," quotes Mr. Nadal `RIA Newska'.
So the representative of the French foreign policy office responded to the question as to whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in Paris' position in the performance of the contract

The Ukrainian National Security Council: seven soldiers were killed in the past 24 hours in the area of military operations
The representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, Andrei Liesenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the fighting zone in the east of the country and 25 had been injured.
The situation in Ilowaysk is extremely difficult.
Until the withdrawal operation is completed, details will not be disclosed.
Upon completion of the operation, loss data and reasons for the situation will be made public.
The perpetrators of such a situation would be held accountable,” added Mr. Lisenko, refusing to discuss the situation in greater detail in Ilowaysk, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded.
According to the representative of the SNBS, “every effort is being made to return soldiers who have been captured”, reports ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Liesenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had withdrawn from Luganska airport in the direction of Georgia.
For more details on the situation in eastern Ukraine, see “Arsen Awakov: The First Ukrainian Military Outflows Under Ilowaysk” in the “Arsen Avakov” article.
Norwegian Cruise approaching $3 billion in Preside Cruises
The Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiating the acquisition of a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide the Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to cruise ships of class "lux" and secured customers of Preside Cruises because it competes with the larger rivals of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, sources reported on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Preside Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of the Norwegian Cruise.
Sources asked to remain unnamed because negotiations were not open.
The representatives of the Norwegian Cruise and Preside Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, manages 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent higher than in 2012.
Preside Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that travel to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She reported income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than one year earlier.
The 29 billion-dollar cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of the middle class in developing economies, such as China and India, in the years to come.
Companies are trying to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulatory authorities for the primary public placement of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after $850 million in 2007.
The Norwegian Cruise was created as it is now, in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator belonging to Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino controlled by the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in the Northern Cruise in 2008.
The Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a share of 28 per cent, Apollo owned a share of 20 per cent, and TPG Capital LP owned a share of 8 per cent in the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of North American cruise passenger flows, according to registration documents, at the first public publication of Prestige Cruises.
Crimea may receive 250 million roubles of subsidies
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is proposed to allocate 250 million roubles in 2014 to State broadcasters.
As shown by the draft Mincompassion Regulation on the Single Portal for Disclosure of Information on the Preparation of Regulations, grants are intended “to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information about the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also be used to purchase equipment, repair roofs and power systems in the radio transmission building based in 1959, reports RIA News.
The Hong Kong Democratic Movement has broken the statement made by the Chinese representative the day after the election decision was taken.
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress established on Sunday a procedure whereby only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the election of the head of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates should first receive the support of the majority of the members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing Lobsters.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the ballot paper and has made democratic activists promise to stop once again Hong Kong's financial centre with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform was the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders feared that the call for democracy would be extended to other cities.
Following the publication of the Beijing document describing China ' s control over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city ' s business centre and held a sit-in strike.
The briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China People ' s Congress, Jang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Bureau of the State Council, Feng Wei, were also to address a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students stated that they would meet at the head of Government of Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain has not mentioned democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 hectares of land owned by Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced their intention to join 400 hectares of land on the West Bank of the Jordan River belonging to Palestinian autonomy.
According to BBC, the decision to join South Bethlehem relates to the desire to pay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli youths in June of this year.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence announced the occupation of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish an administrative office on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saiba Arikata, the world public must call Israel to account for “the ongoing settlement activity on the West Bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin requires Kiev to begin negotiations on the “Statehood” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian Government cease fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “Statehood” of the separated region.
His Spokesperson, Dimitri Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean that the Eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be reviewed in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin ' s appeal to the Kiev Government to begin negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equal to the obvious strategy that it should have since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help separatists take over the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly declared territory of Novorossia de facto independence in order to come closer to Russia, not to the West.
In an interview with the State First Channel of Television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the separatist-held territory in eastern Donetsk and Luganskaya, which had been captured in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian island of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently named the captured territories of Novorossia, or New Russia, which refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace negotiations would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians began campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October, and while government forces attacked peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, the “Illustration plant”, reported ITAR-TASS.
“We must start meaningful negotiations immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political order of the society and the State status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said that Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the East regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict”.
The intervention of the Kremlin Press Secretary to correct the “untrue interpretation” of Putin's words underlined the decision of the Russian leadership to act against the separatist rebellion in the east in a way other than the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugan region of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million non-Russian residents and pre-conflict interviews showed widespread support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy which Russian diplomats had discussed in international forums would empower regional Governments in Ukraine to determine trade agreements and foreign policy, in fact, by giving the Kremlin factual control over territory that would connect Russia ' s main territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, joined five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical marine resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and casting plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
The Ukrainian President, Peter Poroshenko, proposed during his inauguration speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, weigh the constitutional amendments to allow more control over their finances and language status to be exercised by the separate regions.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, who are accused of arming and inciting Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to agree with separatist leaders, as equals, followed new rebel offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from before the peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took control of the city of Novoazowsk in an attack, which Ukrainian security officials say they fear to be the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory until Crimea.
This has led to extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupoli, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between the Novoazos and a narrow passage to the Crimea peninsula.
On Saturday, Powderko called on the European Union leaders meeting in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of no return," warned Powderenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; leaders called for the drafting of more severe sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaysk after two convoys of Russian armoured personnel and 1,000 military personnel entered the Donetsk region last week to support the separatists in difficulty, Colonel Andriy Lisenko, the spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, informed the reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers who are reportedly detained in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airliners captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, and reported to Lisenko on Sunday.
The naked scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his aversion to hackers who may have stolen naked photos of his bride, Gabi Greco, and an entire list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was outraged when a number of frank photographs depicting the naked Jennifer Lawrence came onto the Internet as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with famous people.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have about 60 frank photographs of the Star of the Hunger Games, Lawrence and Superstars, including Kate Appton and Kara Delevin, the singer Ryan, Arian Grande and Lia Michel, and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strakhowski and residing in Melbourne also allegedly stole photographs from the iCloud leak.
On the list of 101, the name of the celebrities.
Edelstein, who made a proposal last month to Greco, said Confidential, "That's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was "shameless" and that the people she was directed to were "responsible to be invaded."
The hacker is expected to have 30 photographs of Palmer with a former boyfriend, Scott Spidman, including two images of her lying in the naked pool.
Palmer's work in the movie includes Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of "Chac" Strahoski and the actress of "Prohibited Reception" Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen photos.
The representative of Lawrence said TMZ: "This is a sudden invasion of privacy."
Acter Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker by Twittering: "To put out photos stolen from the mobile phone is, in fact, no different from the sale of stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, you can't tolerate publishing stolen photos.
Potential method of theft of photographs of naked celebrityes discovered
The mass hacking of star accounts may be due to vulnerability in the Annex Find My Phone.
A potential scenario of events described the Next Web resource.
A Python script was published on the Gitub resource, which allows you to select passwords for the Find My Phoner service of Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
The same combination of logic and Apple ID password is used to access it as the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photographs of famous photographs were stolen.
The script allows you to recognize a password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces various combinations of symbols, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the Find My Phone service provided no password input.
When the security system is properly organized, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and the user must be informed of the hacking attempt.
Because of vulnerability, the users had not received any notice of an attempt to obtain a password for their account.
The hackers recognized the password from Apple ID and used it to access iClaude.
According to Hackapp's Twitter user, vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripting tool for selecting passwords was written on it.
The vulnerability is currently closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user of Hackapp and noted that the vulnerability mentioned above was common to many services, but noted that it had no evidence that such vulnerability had been used to access the “star” account.
It's not me, plz RT.
The Prime Minister has re-enacted foreign records on Twitter
Although there is no solid evidence that vulnerability in Find My Phone has been used to steal photographs, there has been a wave of harmful acts using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, the safety of the clouds was not compromised, but did not investigate how users had lost their accounts.
Russia has also previously been hit by the Twitter of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev.
If the perpetrators have access to iCloud as described above, the password of the head of government account in the microblogging service may also be stored there.
The Next Web resource could not obtain Apple's comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-conqueror
President Vladimir Putin of Russia gave Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anna Burak.
The relevant decree is published on the Internet legal portal.
Earlier this year, the athlete moved to Russia to a permanent residence and asked the Federation of Modern Five Camps to give her the opportunity to speak in favour of the congregated Russian Federation.
In 2013, it won two phases of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European championship in personal life, and became the world championship of a mixed-staphet, one of the new kinds of sport.
It maintains leadership positions during the current season.
According to the rules, she will need special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee to address the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Anna Burac is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her nationality.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to Shakhmatist Ekaterina Laggen, a native of Lviv, who is a two-time champion of Europe (2005, 2008), a world on the face (2010) and a rapid chess game (2014).
Within the Ukrainian women ' s team, the athlete was the winner of the chess lympiad in Turin (2006), the command championship of peace in Astana (2013) and the command championship of Europe in Warsaw (2013).
SCR dropped its investigation into the disaster of Tu 204 in Vnoukovo
The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation (RCC) has terminated its criminal investigation of the accident of the Red Wings aircraft Tu 204.
This is reported by the agency ' s press service.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and the aircraft engineer.
The forensic examination revealed that the disaster was caused by an increase in landing rates, a failure by the crew to comply with standard landing procedures, and an inadvertent departure of engines to higher direct drive speeds.
The Red Wings flight to Prague Moscow took off on 29 December 2012 when it landed at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.
The airship flew across the airstrip and was set on fire.
At the scene, an aircraft commander, a second pilot and a flight engineer were killed.
Two flight attendants were taken to a hospital where they subsequently died of injuries.
Three additional flight attendants who had been hospitalized with severe bodily injuries had been treated for a long time.

Anger has proved to be the most universal and functional human emotion
The hard expression of the face is biologically universal for mankind, and every organ and group of muscles involved in it is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists in Australia and the United States have clarified.
They described their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavore, and they can be briefly read in a press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - moved and lowered down the eyebrows, drawn into a thin line of lips, crushed nostrils - is the same in all cultures and is made by children who are blind from birth who have never seen it, notes the lead author of the study, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has emerged to deal effectively with disputes during conflict.
The more physical harm one person may cause to another, the more ability he has to dictate his circumstances, and the more he reports it to the householder by means of anger.
Researchers have found support for another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to become angry and to move to action, feel that they have the power to impose conditions that are not suitable for them, and prefer to use force to resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner.
In view of the fact that anger is primarily “the emotion of the tender”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles that create the angry expression of the person should make the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor, thereby making him accept his conditions as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, researchers simulated on the computer the persons where each of the seven elements of the angry person was present or missing, and showed them to the informers.
While the lost eyebrows or forward-looking chins did not individually make a person wicked, the physical participants who were represented with such characteristics recognized the strength of the study as unanimous.
Man’s anger, like that of animals, poses a threat: an exaggerated display of his own strength, forcing him to accept and obey.
A man crushes his nostrils and squeezing his lips for the same purpose as a plumbing frog, or baboon, that shows its ticks.
“Gneve “starts” by refusing to accept the situation and the person immediately takes the form that best demonstrates the consequences of the refusal.
But the most amazing thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," noted Anthropologist John Tuby.
Mincomms proposed to allocate 250 million Crim radio transmission roubles
Mincombs proposed to allocate 250 million roubles from the federal budget to the autonomous non-profit organization Krim in 2014.
This is referred to in a draft Government Regulation prepared by an agency that has studied Lenta.ru.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed “to cover the costs of creating a wide-ranging coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is planned to convert the hardware studio unit, video walls, central hardware and video server.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite sender is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fibre-optic link (VOLS) and for the renovation of the energy system.
Grants will be provided within the framework of the federal budget provided for by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The State Broadcasting Company Crimea was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, over 75 per cent of the peninsula has been reached on television.
In 2011, the Crimea Television Company obtained a digital television license.
