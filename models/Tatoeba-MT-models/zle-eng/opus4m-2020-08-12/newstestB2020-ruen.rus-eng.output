We need to get them ready and fix the situation.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably be fixed.
But first of all, I think we need to add to the component of unity.
I think we have a problem with this.

China strongly opposes the adoption of the “Taibey Bill” by the United States.
China strongly opposes the adoption of the so-called “Taibey Bill”, which seriously violates the one-China principle and the three-American joint communiqués.
That was stated by the official representative of the Office of the Gossovet of the PRC for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan on Friday.
The approval by the United States Senate Committee on International Relations of the bill also constitutes a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and gross interference in China ' s internal affairs, noted Ma Xiaoguán.
He said that Taiwan was part of China, and the issues involved related to China ' s internal affairs.
“We call upon the American side to clarify the situation, immediately to stop moving forward with the relevant negative bills, and immediately to stop interfering with the Taiwan question in order to avoid further damage to China-American relations and to peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits,” he noted.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by no one and no force, stressed Ma Xiaoguan.
TikTok hides unpleasant videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under the age of 18 years.
China / Reuters
TikTok, a Chinese social network, censorships videos that mention Tiananmen Square, the independence of Tibet, or the banned religious group Falun Gong, relates The Guardian.
Papers from the publication show that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is promoting China ' s foreign policy objectives abroad by means of an application.
The majority of violations of China's policy fall under the “inflammation of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places unpleasant publications in a context appropriate to the general rules so that the activities of the social network do not appear to be censorship.
For example, the prohibition of criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general prohibition of “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on the mention of incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “stirring of China's history or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of 20 “Foreign leaders or public figures”, including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sena and Kim Jong Yin, the Indian policy of Mahatmu Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, the Japanese Prime Minister Sinzo Abe, the South Korean President Park Kin Hee, the President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo and the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications in the first category are removed by social media administrators and may result in user lockdowns.
The second category is not too severe: such publications remain on the site, but are limited to TikTok algorithms.
The representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "Now we use a localized approach for modernization, and we attract independent local professionals."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says Co-founder Rustem Bogdanov’s “Praducer Center”.
The Preducer Centre is a Russian media company that formally cooperates with TikTok.
All of the bloggers of Preducer Center agree with the social media, but the user's material can be placed without agreement, and passed on to the Bogdans.
Asked if TikTok could speak about politics or Putin, the Bogdans responded positively and said that they had seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of the Our Digital Roman Zaripov: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: there is no way to present shocking content that discriminates against speech and so forth.”
But under these rules, any content that the modernists don't like, says Zarip.
Zaripova is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under the age of 18.
By user agreement, TikTok may only be used by persons over the age of 13.
Social media administrators test their age by artificial intelligence: the neurosthet analyzes persons and determines how long a person looks, tells Bogdan.
If the narossus decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on WeWork ' s Quarkina.
The people of Istanbul reported on an earthquake in the city
A severe earthquake caused panic in Turkey’s largest city
Last Thursday, 26 September, an earthquake hit Istanbul on 5.9 in Istanbul.
Thirty-four people have been injured, 10 of whom are still in hospitals.
A woman in Istanbul, Melika, admitted that she had had a panic attack for the first time in her life.
"I cried so much.
She was crying right at the workplace.
Later it became easier, and I went back to work.
But I'm so embarrassed now!" she told the TV channel "360."
"There was a really strong earthquake in Istanbul.
I can't come back!
But in general, I'm fine," he shared his experiences with political scientist Jaylan Ozgül.
The project manager Celin noted that the mayor of the city kept everyone informed, but she said that the citizens still felt a little hit by a magnet of about 3.2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the communication problem immediately after the earthquake.
The woman said she couldn't reach her mother, but the Internet was "good" and she was able to send a message through the CupApp.
As kp.ru wrote, after the earthquake, all kindergartens and schools were closed, from which all students were evacuated.
473 buildings were damaged.
The epicenter of powerful underground pushes was recorded 68 kilometres west of Istanbul, in the Marble Sea.

Of course I made a mistake.
And I take full responsibility for what I've done.
But everyone makes mistakes.
And the club and I have been discussing how to deal with this situation.
I don't think anything's gone wrong in our relationship.
In Roszarzor, the results of the examination of amputation of the child ' s hand were reported
The child in Rostowsky region was amputated because of a medical error, reports "The Look" with reference to the site of the territorial authority of Rosdravnadzor.
The 11-year-old boy broke his hand and was cast into the Zernograd hospital.

Russian warned of false calls from banks
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of calls from fraudsters who replace the phone number of the bank.
This is reported by Commersanta with reference to the Central Bank's data.
During the summer of 2019, the regulator transmitted information to the communication operators about more than 25,000 numbers from which the clients of the various financial organizations had been reached.
In 189 cases, operators found a replacement number.
A further 218 numbers have been blocked and 59 have imposed restrictions on the use of financial services.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the CB, Artem Sicev, reported that a wide range of Russian banks had been affected by the change of number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings about fraudulent calls, referring to the absence of such a duty in the Communications Act.
The opening bank, Rosbank and Alpha Bank confirmed the increase in the number of false calls with the replacement number.
As reported by the press service Bilaina, part of the information on the fraudulent calls that the CB had transmitted was incorrect: the lists had numbers that were actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their closure would lead to disruptions in the work of the organization.
Artem Sicev explained that the Central Bank was planning to establish a number base for fraudsters, which the liaison operator would contact on each call to check the number.
He explained that such a framework would require legislative amendments.

The commissions came under the supervision of Medoza, MBX Media, Voice of America, Real Time, Radio Liberty, and Russian BBC Service.
Previously, planned audits of Google and Facebook services were reported.
Piscarev also stated that he would ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to decide on further accreditation of German Deutsche Welle, in whose publications the Commission found signs of justification for extremism.
In September, Roskomnadzor discovered political advertising in Google, Facebook and Youtube services.
According to the agency, this was the case during the Russian elections on 8 September.
The facts of the violations have been referred to the Commission of the States Parties.
Google later stated that the company supports responsible political advertising.
Staff members felt that it was bound by the laws of the country.
Facebook noted that the responsibility for compliance with Russian electoral legislation should be borne by advertisers, not the playground.
The head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, accused companies of applying double standards when posting political advertising.
Stoltenberg discussed with Ukraine's Green Entry to NATO
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greenski, discussed Ukraine ' s membership of the alliance in the margins of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
This was the subject of a speech at Columbia University in New York.
In response to the question as to whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg stated that they had indeed discussed the issue and stressed that the reply did not indicate the time frame for Ukraine ' s entry into NATO.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance had an obligation to meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, wrote RT.
In Crimea, the Green Alternative for NATO was proposed
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greenski, should instead pursue good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
This was reported on Friday, 27 September by the Co-President of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinitz.
"The President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of the predecessor, but should heed the advice of [the President of the United States] Donald Trump, who listened to his sour face, and establish relations with the President of Russia," said the Chegrinitz to journalists "RIA News."
Chegrinsky noted that Greenski was a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
He said that it would be possible for the Ukrainian President to remain in power only if relations were established with the Russian Federation.
Earlier on 27 September, the NATO Gensel Jens Stoltenberg reported that he had held a discussion with the Greenski on the country ' s accession to the alliance.
He said that Ukraine was obliged to do so.
On 5 June, Councillor Evgenius Balicki stated that Ukraine ' s possible accession to the alliance did not guarantee a better life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
"Barcelona" blackmailes Neimar
The Spanish "Barcelona" and its former football player, Brazilian Neimar, are trying to resolve the financial dispute that arose after the attacker moved to French "Pari St. German".
The case had almost reached trial, but the Catalans had offered to settle the dispute without Femida's intervention.
Otherwise they refuse him to return.
Neimar and his clever father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, had an interesting focus: by agreement with Barsoy, which the player signed in 2016, he was expected to receive Euro40 million.
However, after just one year, the forum ended up with SWD for the record 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he got 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Not only do Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest on late payment.
When Neimar's claims were reported in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.
“Sine-Granatov” insists that the bonus relied on the performance of the entire contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considers that only a quarter of the Euro40 million was held by the player and requires that the proportion of the first payment be returned.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neimar and Barsa almost agreed to the return of the "bad" player to the Latino of Calonia.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope of a reverse transition remains.
Thus, according to Sport.Ru, with reference to the Insiders, the lawyers of the club stated to the player that unless the issue of financial claims was settled in a pre-trial manner, it would rule out the possibility of returning a Brazilian.
Neimar himself wants to come back so much that he asked for assurances that the Catalans would buy him back.

The EKRE members have not been and will not be invited to the Board.
The composition of the Board of the Bank of Estonia leads to the conclusion of confidence in the Estonian State.

At the same time, the Reform Party wanted Andrés Sutty to join the council instead of Jaanus Tamkivi.
But Laar replied that the aim of the Reforms Party was to have two seats on the Council of the Bank of Estonia so that, in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi, Andrés Sutty would join the Council.
On Tuesday, 24 September, Riigikogu rejected the Laar proposal to appoint new members of the Council of the Bank of Estonia.

Rooms in the centre of Moscow are rented at the cost of an apartment on the outskirts.
Despite the decline in the number of communes in Moscow, there is no demand for them.

Not only the Russian Pension Fund, but also non-State pension funds are able to pay the pension.
The NPF is a private company, reports Volgograd Truth.ru.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and over time it returns interest.
If you are interested in this method, first look at the NPF on the Bank of Russia website.
All funds operate under the same rules established by federal laws.
Pensions can be bought by law.
The number of missing points depends on how many years of service you do not have to pay your pension.
This method is suitable for those who worked informally.

Miller saw Bivers's find and was upset.
He thought he could claim a cart because he was the first to dig in the garbage.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly, Bivers grabbed a cart and ran with it toward his home.
Then Miller took the sword he found in the same heap of samurai and pursued the opponent.
He got Beavers near his house.
Miller pulled his sword out of his knife and started waving it in the direction of the thief of the cart.
Beavers told Miller that what was happening was recorded on the video.

Mass riots on the Three
The “Moscow case” against the participants in the summer protests, the farther apart, the greater the break-up and the loss of political content.
Evidence of “mass disturbances” itself does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to bring the case down on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of the charges.
The collapse of the case must inspire society, but it is certain that it will leave to the extreme irritation of the security forces whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disturbances) - Alexei Minailo was suddenly released without any obligation and, after a few more hours, completely rehabilitated - the JKR dropped the charges.
The past was in custody for almost two months, followed by several professional communities: historians, priests, and Letteraries.
The case then left only two accused of involvement in the riots (originally 13): Sergei Fomin, transferred on 3 September to house arrest, and Samaeddin Rajabov, who was extended by the court the day before the end of December (also charged with violence against the representative of the authority, art. 318 of the Criminal Code).

Meanwhile, along with this petition, Latvia's accession to the “Galactic Empire” and its withdrawal from the solar system and the Milky Way were collected on the website.
It is noted that criminal proceedings have been instituted against Bartecski on the first paragraph of article 82 of the country's Criminal Law, “Publish appeal to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.

Will phytostergorens and phytoandrogenes help to prolong youth?
The subject of phytoandrogenes has been poorly studied.
One of the most famous is pine dust.
However, phytosterrogenes are well researched and have a positive effect on the body.

Hydrometres called the people's loyal omens.
There are many popular acceptances in Russia where people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometre Center, all the techniques that are supposed to work were checked.
Meteorological scientists have concluded that only two of them can truly be trusted in a short period of time.
As the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometre told us, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will indeed be warm, as our ancestors had pointed out.
And if the light of the sky is white, it will be raining the next day.
The second working reception is based on bird surveillance.
More often than not, it's raining if they're flying low.
It is simply explained that when the humidity of the air is large, the mosses are wetted with their wings and the feathers are forced to drop to hunt insects, writing TASS.
There are popular acceptances on various continents.

Unidentified oil stains were found on beaches north-east of Brazil
Oil slicks of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches on north-east Brazil.
Pollution points were scattered over 2,000 kilometres of the coastline.
The first oil stains were reported as early as second September.
However, each day until Thursday, their number, like territorial coverage, continued to increase.

"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after treatment of the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
It is more likely to enter the ocean current," told the Brazilian news portal G1 by the coordinator of the oil union of the states of Pernambuco and Paraíba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches, four of the eight affected states of the north-east of the country identified nine marine turtles covered entirely with oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment will work with Petrobras to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute's specialists recommend that tourists and local residents bypass the oil slicks by side and warn of all sites of pollution that have been detected.

The Russians have nothing to put on retirement - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentine Matvienko, believes that Russians do not have sufficient savings to make a guaranteed pension bill fully available in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions from personal savings in the world is quite common.
The other thing is how timely it is to introduce it.
“In my view, a large part of the population now has incomes from which they have nothing to devote to future increases in pension coverage,” said V. Matvienko.
Russians, according to the Speaker, are unable to understand the mechanisms for the creation and application of the pension, as “continuous changes in this field have ultimately confused them”.
That doesn't mean I'm opposed to improving the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social State, and we must do everything we can to make the pensions, the social security of citizens, better.
But steps in this direction need to be deliberate, responsible, responsive to domestic realities,” stated V. Matvienko, “RIA News”.
The head of the SF stressed that if the initiative (a guaranteed pension bill) was to be developed, several basic principles must necessarily be provided, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and State responsibility for the preservation of pension savings.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that a bill on guaranteed pension products (PPP) would be sent for harmonization.
Among its main elements are the purely voluntary accession of citizens to the system of savings, the guarantee of long-term pension savings on the part of the State, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.

President Marvel Studios Kevin Faigi said he was delighted.
It's amazing that the journey of the Spahi in the crowned Marvel will continue.
"All of us in Marvel Studios are very happy to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a figure.
It's a hero whose history affects all generations and audiences around the world," says his press release.
In doing so, Faiga recalled that Sony also creates his own royal, built right around the Spider-Man.
"It's like he's the only superpowered hero who's ended up in a lot of different captors.
So while Sony continues to develop his own Space Universe, the future may bring unexpected surprises," he noted.
Tom Holland, who played the Spider-Man in five movies, apparently commenting on the news, put in his "Instagram" account an excerpt from the film "Wolk with Wall Street" in which the hero Leonardo de Caprio calls "I'm Not Going!"
Information on the contradictions between companies appeared in August.
According to the media, Disney wanted to receive half of the cash receipts from the Spider-Man films, provided that both companies paid half of the cost of producing paintings.
But Sony didn't do it.
The news of the possible departure of a favorite superhero from the crowned Marvel caused anger among many devoted worshipers.
Details of the new conditions shall not yet be disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement but stated: "We have cooperated perfectly for the last four years, and our joint desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans.
We're glad we can go forward together."
The Bridges: Final film, which brought together the Spider-Man, Thora, Hulk and other superheroes of Marvel, became the most cashier in the history of the world cinema, moving from first place to Avatar.

The description refers to the fact that Winnik was a member of the Russian anti-Ukrainian propaganda action #The World, aimed at translating the responsibilities of Russia (the aggressor country) into Ukraine.
We will recall that Vladimir Pozner, Mirey Matier (France), Alessandro Safina (Italy), Valeria, Soso Pavliasville, Igor Crotta, Zara, Tamara Gverdzti, Denis Clever, Valery Soutkin, Dmitry Malikov, Maxim Pozrivsky, Jan Powlsky, Maxim Averin, Xenia Alferova, Nonna Grishaev, and others took part in the video.
Most members of the flossmobe publicly support the Kremlin’s aggressive policy.
Winnik was the only Ukrainian participant in the project.
In the press service, the singer had previously explained that the artist had participated in the project in support of the International Day of Peace, which was celebrated on 21 September, and that his patriotic position had not changed.
Remember, there was a wave of resentment on the web.
The video itself is called a joke.
How can artists who have visited the occupied Crimea, who have supported Putin's policy, who waged war on Donbassa, where people die almost every day, talk about peace?

The expert told me why I should give up the tea in the bags.
A team of Canadian scientists from McGill University found that over ten billion microplastics particles were added to a cup of tea in five minutes.
An expert on food security, Elizabeth Tchinov, said, can also be added to a packaged drink.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients there that will not appear on the package.
They don't throw them out at the end of the season, so they might end up in tea.
"More than that, it's not always tea plants in the bags," said Tchinova.
She said that it would be better to avoid using such a drink in favor of a tea at a wedding that was sold in specialized shops.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packed tea was not only in composition but also in production - microparticles were heated to high temperatures, which could cause them to release harmful substances.
"It's best to buy clean green or black tea - it'll have the least extra in it," the expert said.

Regions were invited to share business support secrets
As the “Parliament Gazette” noted, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Council of the Federation ' s Economic Policy Council, Andrei Kutepov, addressed a letter to the Minister for Economic Development, Maxim Oreskin, and the Minister of Finance, Anton Silvaanov, inviting him to express his position on initiatives by the Federation ' s players to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship (SME).
It is time to establish interregional links
The Committee of the Council of the Federation for Economic Policy has compiled information from the regions on their business development and legalization programmes and on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions shared with senators the problems of SME development and made proposals to improve existing legislation.
“To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently established, and as a result, the business community in all regions has identified the issue of the lack of information on regional programmes for enterprise development in the country as a whole,” noted Andrei Koutep.
In an annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive regional work on legalization of self-employment and a summary of regional proposals and issues (available at the disposal of the text).
In addition to line ministries, summary data from the regions are also sent to regional executive heads.
The exchange of information on positive gains in the regions could give impetus to enterprise development in general.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” said the senator’s “Parliament Gazette”.
Useful Experiences
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully implemented programmes to support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, there is a Business Support Centre in the Voloda region which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
The Ivanov region has developed a business support system that implements the principle of one window through multi-functional centres.
In the Krasnodar province, grants are made to agricultural consumer cooperatives from the regional budget.
The Orlov region has a cluster development centre.
The Amur Region under the federal project entitled “Acquisition of Small and Medium Enterprises” provides for the possibility of subsidization of business incubators established through existing non-State Koorking Centres from the federal budget.
In a number of other regions special support measures for youth entrepreneurship are being implemented.
Self-employed keep getting out of the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes to existing legislation should be made to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Archangelical Region proposed to replace the term “self-employment” with “business”, since this “is most appropriate for the content of public services to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In Ivanov province, amendments are considered necessary to expand the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including activities related to the separation and renovation of accommodations, day-buildings and physical training.
The British region considers it important to strengthen the control of unfair milk producers through the Mercure veterinary system.
In the Kostrom and Magadan provinces, the concept of social entrepreneurship and support for social entrepreneurship is promoted.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized entrepreneurship and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills,” assured Andrey Koutep.
The airline helped passengers to avoid neighbors with weeping children
A Japanese Airlines (JAL) aircraft launched a new function: when booked, it is now possible to find out where young children will be sitting.
Now you can avoid them if you want to be close to them.
The Japanese Airlines (JAL) passengers were given the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted neighborhoods with young children.
The air carrier has launched a function to track the locations of the children.

Thus, those who do not want to fly next to the babies because of the possible inconveniences associated with their crying may be as far away from them as possible.
The Internet users who use airline services were thrilled by the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One juder complained that he had flown from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and there were three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator proposed the introduction of “reams for adults only”, expressing his willingness to pay for such a flight.
Many tourists have noted that they will now try to choose Japanese Airlines for their travels because they see nothing pleasant about flying next to a crying child in a closed space.
In the past, a woman traveling with a breast-feeding child had tried to placate the travelers during the Seoul-San Francisco flight.

Akter Pavel Ustinov joins the "Freedom All" series of single pickets, which are held on Friday at the President's Office of the Russian Federation's Old Square in Moscow, which is broadcast by Interfax correspondent.
A series of pickets began on 18 September in support of Usstenov himself and has continued every day ever since.
At present, participants in the action stand holding a sign with the title “Freedom for All” and the names of the convicted and arrested following the unconsented meetings in Moscow in the summer of 2019.

The supply of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times
In the Government of the Russian Federation, it was estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo had been reduced by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin by the Russian Federation, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries during the first half of the year 2019, compared with 3 million 442.2 thousand tons in the same period in 2013, reports Interfax.
The value of imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4 billion,975.5 million, respectively.
It is the supply of goods that are not subject to the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the volume of imported products has been offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.
It will be recalled that, at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the rules on the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food that are prohibited from entering Russia within the framework of counter-sanctions.
A document posted on the official legal information portal noted that the rules were extended for a further period of one year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Originally, the order to destroy sanctions applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, since 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Ukraine have “joint to join” the list.
Putin's decree on the destruction of the illegal entry into the country of “sanction” (products under the food embargo which Moscow imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.
The Government, in turn, allowed the destruction of “sanction” food by any legal means.
As the sanctions of the West continued, the Russian Federation also extended its response.
This measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption up to five kilograms.

In Chile, a telescope worth 1 billion euros began to be built
TASS reported this with reference to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
According to ESO, this week the construction of the building's dome, where the E-ELT telescope (European Extraremely Large Telescope, “European Superheated Telescope”) will be located, has officially begun as long as it is the most expensive and ambitious ground astronomical project.
Its total value is estimated to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the construction of equipment and the building of the observatorium.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 metres.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments of 1.4 meters.
It's a huge mirror as well as two supporting reflection surfaces that are 4.2 and 3.75 meters in diameter will help E-ELT get the first detailed photos of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and look for Earth's doubles.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surrounding Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Although the construction of the dome is only started, mirrors, scientific instruments and other observatories have been developed by scientists, engineers and other specialists for three years since the first E-ELT construction plans were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, with a total value of about Euro400 million, was awarded by the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
