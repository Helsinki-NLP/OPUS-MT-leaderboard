We'll have to prepare for them and fix the situation.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably be fixed.
But first of all, I think we need to add to the component of unity.
I think we have a problem with that.

China strongly opposes the adoption of the “Taibey Bill” by the United States
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called “Tabey Bill”, which seriously violates the one-China principle and the three-American joint communiqués.
This was stated by the official representative of the Office of the Gossovette of the PRC for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan on Friday.
The approval by the United States Senate Committee on International Relations of the Bill also constitutes a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and gross interference in China ' s internal affairs, noted Ma Xiaoguán.
He said that Taiwan was part of China and the issues involved were China ' s internal affairs.
“We call upon the American side to clarify the situation, immediately to stop moving forward with the relevant negative bills, and immediately to stop interfering with the Taiwan question in order to avoid further damage to China-American relations, as well as to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he said.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by any one and no other force, Ma Xiaoguan emphasized.
TikTok hides unpleasant videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under 18 years of age.
China / Reuters
TikTok, a Chinese social network, censorships videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet Independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong, relates The Guardian.
The documents before the publication state that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) uses the application to advance China's foreign policy objectives abroad.
The bulk of the violations of China's policy fall under the “inflammation of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places unpleasant publications in a context suitable for general rules so that the activities of the social network do not appear to be censorship.
For example, the prohibition of criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general prohibition of “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
A ban on the mention of incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “stirring of China's history or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of the twenty “Foreign Leaders or Government Officials”, including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sena and Kim Jing Ein, the Indian policy of Mahatmu Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, the Japanese Prime Minister Sinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kin Hee, the President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo and the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications in the first category are removed by social media administrators and may result in user lockdowns.
The second category of violations is not too severe: such publications remain on the website, but are limited to TikTok algorithms.
The representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "We are now using a localized approach to the modernization, and we are also attracting independent local professionals."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says Co-founder Rustem Bogdanov’s Preducer Center.
The Preducer Centre is a Russian media company that formally cooperates with TikTok.
All of the bloggers of Preducer Center agree with the social media, but the user's material can be placed without agreement, and passed on to the Bogdans.
Asked if TikTok could speak about politics or Putin, the Bogdans responded positively and said that they had seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of Our Digital Roman Zaripov: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: there is no way to present shocking content that discriminates against words and so forth.”
But under these rules, any content that the modernists don't like can be subsumed, says Zarip.
Zaripova is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under the age of 18.
By user agreement, TikTok may only be used by persons over 13.
Social media administrators test their age by artificial intelligence: Neurosthet analyzes faces and determines what kind of years a person looks like, tells Bogdan.
If the narossus decides that the user is younger, his account may be removed, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on WeWork’s Quarkina.
The people of Istanbul reported on the earthquake in the city
A severe earthquake caused panic in Turkey’s largest city
Last Thursday, 26 September, an earthquake hit Istanbul on 5.9 in Istanbul.
Thirty-four people have been injured, 10 of whom are still in hospitals.
A woman in Istanbul, Melika, admitted that she had had a panic attack for the first time in her life.
"I cried so much.
She was crying right in the workplace.
Later it became easier, and I went back to work.
But I'm so embarrassed now!" the girl told the TV channel "360."
"There was a real big earthquake in Istanbul.
I can't go back yet!
But I'm fine in general," he shared his experiences with political scientist Jaylan Ozgül.
The project manager Selin noted that the mayor of the city kept everyone informed, but she said that the citizens still felt a little hit by a magnet of about 3.2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the communication problem immediately after the earthquake.
The woman said she couldn't reach her mother, but the Internet was "good" and she was able to send a message through the CupApp.
As kp.ru wrote, after the earthquake, all kindergartens and schools were closed, from which all students were evacuated.
473 buildings were damaged.
The epicenter of powerful underground pushes was recorded 68 kilometres west of Istanbul, in the Marble Sea.
Matthews met with Toronto's management.

But everyone makes mistakes.
And the club and I discussed how to deal with the situation.
I don't think anything's gone wrong in our relationship.
In Roszarzor, the results of the examination of amputation of the child ' s hand were reported
The child in Rostowsky province was amputated because of a medical error, reports "Looking" with reference to the site of the territorial authority of Rosdravnadzor.
The 11-year-old boy broke his hand and was cast into the Zernograd hospital.
In time, the child developed gangrene and amputated.
The test found that the timeliness and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as the standard and volume of assistance provided, had been violated.
The verification materials have been transferred to the Russian CCS for the region.
Previously, URA.RU had reported that the head of the southrulsk Hillary had been arrested.
Russian warned of false calls from banks
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of calls from fraudsters replacing the phone number of the bank.
This is reported by Commersanta with reference to the Central Bank's data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator transmitted information to the communication operators about more than 2,500 numbers from which the clients of the various financial organizations had been reached.
In 189 cases, operators found a replacement number.
A further 218 numbers have been blocked and in 59 cases a restriction on the use of financial services has been imposed.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the CB, Artem Sicev, reported that a wide range of Russian banks had been affected by the change of number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings about fraudulent calls, referring to the absence of such a duty in the Communications Act.
The opening bank, Rosbank and Alpha Bank confirmed that there had been an increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a replacement number.
According to the press service Bilaina, part of the information about the fraudulent calls that the CB had transmitted was incorrect: the lists had numbers that were actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their closure would lead to disruptions in the work of the organization.
Artem Sicev told us that the Central Bank is planning to establish a number base for fraudsters, which the liaison operator will contact on each call to check the number.
He explained that such a framework would require legislative amendments.

The commissions came under the supervision of Medoza, MBX Media, Voice of America, Real Time, Radio Freedom and Russian BBC Service.
Previously, planned audits of Google and Facebook services were reported.
Piscarev also stated that he would request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to decide on further accreditation of German Deutsche Welle, in whose publications the Commission found signs of justification for extremism.
In September, Roskomnadzor discovered political advertising in Google, Facebook and Youtube services.
According to the agency, this was the case during the Russian elections of 8 September.
The facts of the violations have been referred to the Commission of the States Parties.
Google later stated that the company supported responsible political advertising.
Staff members felt that it was bound by the laws of the country.
Facebook noted that the responsibility for compliance with Russian electoral legislation should be borne by advertisers, not the site.
The head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, accused companies of applying double standards in the posting of political advertising.
Stoltenberg discussed with Ukraine ' s Green Entry to NATO
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and President Vladimir Greenski of Ukraine discussed Ukraine ' s membership in the United Nations General Assembly ' s fields of alliance.
This was the subject of a speech at Columbia University in New York.
In response to the question as to whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg stated that they had indeed discussed the issue and stressed that the reply did not indicate the time frame for Ukraine ' s entry into NATO.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance was obliged to meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, wrote RT.
In Crimea, the Green Alternative to NATO was offered
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greenski, should instead pursue good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
This was reported on Friday, 27 September by the Co-President of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinitz.
“The President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of the predecessor, but should heed the advice of [the President of the United States] Donald Trump, who listened to his sour face, and establish relations with the President of Russia,” said the Chegrinitz to the journalists of RIA News.
Chegrinsky noted that Greenski was a good actor for him, but he was a bad politician.
He said that the Ukrainian President would be able to remain in power only if relations were established with the Russian Federation.
Earlier on 27 September, the NATO Gensel Jens Stoltenberg reported that he had held a discussion with Greenski on the country ' s accession to the alliance.
He said that Ukraine had a duty to do so.
On 5 June, Councillor Evgenius Balicki stated that Ukraine ' s possible accession to the alliance did not guarantee a better life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
"Barcelona" blackmailes Neimar
The Spanish "Barcelona" and its former football player, Brazilian Neimar, are trying to resolve the financial dispute that arose after the attacker went to the French "Pari St. German".
The case had almost reached trial, but the Catalans had offered to settle the dispute without Femida's intervention.
Otherwise they refuse to return him.
Neimar and his clever father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, had an interesting focus: by agreement with Barsoy, which the player signed in 2016, he was expected to receive Euro40 million.
However, after just one year, the forum ended up in the U.S.J. for the record of Euro222 million.
Nevertheless, he got 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Not only do Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest on late payment.
When Neimar's claims were heard in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.
“Sina-Granatov” insists that the bonus relied on the performance of the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considers that only a quarter of the Euro40 million was held by the player and requires that the proportion of the first payment be returned.
But the most interesting thing is that, in the summer, Neimar and Barsa almost agreed to the return of the "bad" player to Catlonia.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope of a reverse transition remains.
According to Sport.Ru, with reference to the Insiders, the lawyers of the club stated to the player that unless the issue of the financial claims was settled in a pre-trial manner, it would rule out the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Neimar himself wants to come back so much that he asked for assurances that the Catalans would buy him back.

But Laar responded that the aim of the Reform Party was to have two seats on the Council of the Bank of Estonia so that, in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi, Andrés Sutty would join the Council.
On Tuesday, 24 September, Riigikogu rejected the Laar proposal to appoint new members of the Council of the Bank of Estonia.

How to increase the future pension without reprocessing
Not only the Russian Pension Fund, but also non-State pension funds, are able to pay the pension.
The NPF is a private company, reports Volgograd Truth.ru.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and over time it returns interest.
If you're interested in this method, first look at the NPF on the Bank of Russia website.
All funds operate under the same rules established by federal laws.
Pensions can be bought by law.
The number of missing points depends on how many years of service you do not have to pay your pension.

Mass riots on the Three
The “Moscow case” against the participants in the summer protests, the farther apart, the greater the break-up and the loss of political content.
Evidence of “mass disturbances” itself does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to bring the case down on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of the charges.
The collapse of the case must inspire society, but it will certainly leave the extreme irritation of the security forces, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the remaining three accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disturbances) - Alexei Minailo was suddenly released without any obligation, and several hours later he was fully rehabilitated: the JKK withdrew his charges.
The past two months of arrest, he was followed by several professional communities: historians, priests, and Letteraries.
The case then left only two accused of involvement in the riots (originally 13): Sergey Fomin, transferred on 3 September to house arrest, and Samaeddin Rajabov, who was extended by the court the previous day by the end of December (also accused of violence against a representative of the authority, art. 318 of the Criminal Code).

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation proposes punishment for assaulting police officers on the Internet.
The Ministry of the Interior has prepared amendments to the Police Act to protect police custody from the dissemination of slanderous and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal legal portal, and the draft instrument itself had not yet been published.

It is not clear how to protect the police from the slander of the network.
However, the explanation of the document indicates that the provisions of the amendments will be applied “by the individualization of the mechanism”, an already pre-judgment law on the blocking of posts that offend the authorities, and a law on fines for such posts.
Both laws entered into force in March this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussion and independent anti-corruption expertise.

Will phytostergorens and phytoandrogenes help to prolong youth?
The subject of phytoandrogenes has been poorly studied.
One of the most famous is pine dust.
However, phytosterrogenes are well researched and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain age-related diseases (including cardiovascular, certain cancers).
The known sources of phytoestrogen are all beans (the most popular is soybeans), hopel, seeds lyre.

Hydrometres called the loyal people's renditions.
There are many popular acceptances in Russia where people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
In the Hydrometres Center, all the techniques that are supposed to work were checked.
Meteorological scientists have concluded that only two can truly be trusted in a short period of time.
As the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometre told us, Roman Willand, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will indeed be warm, as our ancestors had pointed out.
And if the sky is white, it will be raining the next day.
The second working reception is based on bird surveillance.
More often than not, it's raining if they're flying low.
The explanation is simple: When the humidity of the air is large, the mosses are wetted with wings and the feathers are forced to drop to hunt insects, writing TASS.
On different continents, there are popular acceptances.

Unidentified oil stains were found on beaches north-east of Brazil
Oil slicks of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches on north-east Brazil.
Pollution points were scattered over 2,000 kilometres of the coastline.
The first oil stains were reported as early as second September.
However, each day up to Thursday, their number, like territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute for the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out that they're all identical and it's crude oil.
In the State Petroleum Corporation of Petrrobras, which was transferred to analyse the samples found, it was stated that they were not in the composition of the oil extracted from the deposits in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It may be dropped from one of the ships after the treatment of the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it was in the ocean current," told the Brazilian news portal G1 by the coordinator of the oil union of the states of Pernambuco and Paraíba Rogerio Almeida.
He added that despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches, four of the eight affected states of the north-east of the country found nine sea turtles covered entirely by oil.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment will work with Petrobras to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute's specialists recommend that tourists and local residents bypass the oil slicks by side and warn of all the sites found.

In addition, Mr. Medvedev instructed all of the above-mentioned agencies other than the Ministry to submit proposals for a monitoring experiment on 1 January 2020 for general service organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad region.
By 11 November, the Ministry and the Ministry of Economy had been instructed to introduce a bill to the Government, amended by the COAP, to apply administrative suspensions for violations of nutritional requirements that had caused health damage.
In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Economy, Roswannadzor and Minfina need to work on a gradual transition from 2021 to the establishment of a consumer basket based on a basic set of products that provides a healthy diet.
Remember, the out-of-date standards of business community requirements were discussed after one cafe from UnderSon was closed.

The Russians have nothing to put on retirement - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentine Matvienko, believes that Russians do not have sufficient savings to make a guaranteed pension bill fully available in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions from personal savings in the world is quite common.
Another thing is how timely it is to introduce it.
“In my view, a large part of the population now has incomes from which they have nothing to devote to future increases in pension coverage,” said V. Matvienko.
According to the Speaker, the Russian Federation is unable to understand the mechanisms for the creation and application of the pension, as “permanent changes in this area have ultimately confused them”.
That doesn't mean I'm opposed to improving the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social State, and we must do our utmost to ensure that pensions, social security of citizens, are improved.
But steps in this direction need to be deliberate, responsible, responsive to domestic realities,” stated V. Matvienko, “RIA News”.
The head of the SF stressed that if the initiative (a guaranteed pension bill) were to be developed, several basic principles must necessarily be established, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and State responsibility for the preservation of pension savings.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced on 6 September that it would be sent to agree on a draft law on a guaranteed pension product (PPP).
Among its main elements are the purely voluntary accession of citizens to the system of savings, the guarantee of the security of long-term pension savings of citizens by the State, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.

Sony and Disney agreed
The right-wing illustration of Getty Images Image caption News about the withdrawal of a favorite superhero from the kingly Marvel caused the anger of many devoted worshipers
One of the most famous comic book heroes, the Spider-Man, will remain in the crowned Marvel.
Disney and Sony Pictures were able to agree on rights to use it in franchise films.
This was reported in Sony's press release, which states that the third part of Spider-Man with Tom Holland will appear on the screen on July 16, 2021.
Previously, it had been reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on income-sharing, which would cause the "Man-Man-Man" to leave the abandoned Marvel.
Sony owns film hero rights.
She rented them for Marvel films, which belongs to Disney.
As a result, Sony earned revenue from film rolls and Disney earned from gifts and toys.
It was reported that at some point such a situation had ceased to exist, and the company wanted to review the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Faigi said he was delighted.
It's amazing that the journey of the Spachi in the crowned Marvel will continue.
"All of us in Marvel Studios are very happy to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a figure.
It's a hero whose history affects all generations and audiences around the world," says his press release.
In doing so, Faige recalled that Sony also creates his own royal, built around the Spider-Man.
"It happened that he was the only superpowered hero who found himself in a variety of captors.
So while Sony continues to develop his own Space Universe, the future may bring unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, who played the Spider-Man in five movies, apparently commenting on the news, put in his "Instagram" account an excerpt from the film "Wolk with Wall Street" in which the hero Leonardo de Caprio calls "I'm Not Going!"
Information on the contradictions between companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the cash receipt from the Spider-Man films, provided that both companies paid half of the cost of producing paintings.
But Sony didn't do it.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from the crowned Marvel provoked the anger of many devoted worshipers.
The details of the new conditions are pending.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement but stated: "We have cooperated perfectly for the last four years, and our joint desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans.
We're glad we can go forward together."
The Bridges: Final film, which brought together the Spider-Man, Thora, Hulk and other superheroes of Marvel, became the most cashier in the history of the world cinema, moving from first place to Avatar.

The description refers to the fact that Winnik was a member of the Russian anti-Ukrainian propaganda action #The World, aimed at translating the responsibility of Russia (the aggressor country) into Ukraine.
We will recall that Vladimir Pozner, Mirey Matier (France), Alessandro Safina (Italy), Valeria, Soso Pavliasville, Igor Crotta, Zara, Tamara Gverdztsati, Denis Clever, Valery Soutkin, Dmitri Malikov, Maxim Pozrivsky, Jan Powlsky, Maxim Averin, Xenia Alferova, Nonna Grishaev, and others took part in the video.
Most members of the flossmobe publicly support the Kremlin’s aggressive policy.
Winnik was the only Ukrainian participant in the project.
In the press service, the singer had previously explained that the artist had participated in the project in support of the International Day of Peace, which was celebrated on 21 September, and that his patriotic position had not changed.
Remember, there was a wave of resentment on the web.
The video itself is called a joke.
How can artists who have visited the occupied Crimea, who have supported Putin's policy, who waged war on Donbassa, where people die almost every day, talk about peace?
Four people were convicted of a series of robbery in Khabarovska.
In Khabarovska, the court sentenced four residents of the village of Droedba who had robbed the Cosmos and Raduga partnerships in the Black River for two years.

The criminal group consisted of former men aged 31 and 37 and two brothers aged 21 and 24.
It was found that the originator of the crime was an older brother who, in his youth, had served in a juvenile colony.
On his own, he robbed nine houses, and later the rest of the houses were connected.
The damage to each of the thefts was between three and two thousand roubles.
The criminals took out ovens, refrigerators, curtains, buckets, gas cylinders, chairs, shoes, and many other items.
They were captured by the security alarm in the last house.

The expert told me why I should give up my tea bags.
A team of Canadian scientists from McGill University found that over ten billion microplastic particles were added to a cup of tea in five minutes.
A food safety expert, Elizabeth Tchinov, said, may also add pollen particles to the packaged drink.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients there that will not be listed on the package.
They don't throw at the end of the season, so they might end up in tea.
"What's more, the chips don't always include tea plants," said Tchinova.
She said that it would be better to avoid using such a drink in favor of a tea at a wedding that was sold in specialized shops.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of packed tea was not only in composition but also in production - microparticles were heated to high temperatures, which could cause them to release harmful substances.
“The best thing to buy is a clean green or black tea, which is the least supplement to it,” the expert pointed out.

Regions were invited to share business support secrets
As the “Parliament Gazette” noted, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Council of the Federation ' s Economic Policy Council, Andrei Koutepov, addressed a letter to the Minister of Economic Development, Maxim Oreskin, and Minister of Finance, Anton Silvaanov, inviting him to express his position on initiatives by the Federation ' s entities to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship (SME).
It is time to establish interregional links
The Committee of the Council of the Federation for Economic Policy has compiled information from the regions on their business development and legalization programmes and on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions presented to senators the problems of SME development and put forward proposals to improve existing legislation.
“To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently established, and as a result, the business community in all regions has identified the issue of the lack of information on regional programmes for enterprise development in the country as a whole,” noted Andrei Koutep.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive regional efforts to legalize self-employment and a summary of regional proposals and issues (available at the appropriate level).
In addition to line ministries, summary data from the regions are also sent to the heads of the regional executive branch.
The exchange of information on positive gains in the regions could give rise to enterprise development in general.
The first step towards such an exchange would be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” said the senator’s “Parliament Gazette”.
Useful Experiences
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully implemented programmes to support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, there is a Business Support Centre in the Voloda region, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.

The Amur Region under the federal project entitled “Acquisition of Small and Medium Enterprises” provides for the possibility of subsidising business incubators established through existing non-State Koorking Centres from the federal budget.
A number of other regions have special support measures for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be taken out of the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes in existing legislation should be made in order to better support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Archangelic Region proposed to replace the term “self-employment” with “business”, as this “is most appropriate for the content of public services to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In Ivanov province, amendments are deemed necessary to expand the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including activities related to the separation and renovation of accommodations, day-buildings and physical training.
The British region considers it important to strengthen control over unfair milk producers through the Mercure veterinary system.

“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills”, assured Andrey Koutep.
The airline helped passengers to avoid neighbors with weeping children
A Japanese Airlines (JAL) aircraft has launched a new function: when booking aircraft sites, you can now find out where young children will be sitting.
Now you can avoid them if you want to be close to them.
The Japanese Airlines (JAL) passengers were given the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted contact with young children.
The air carrier has launched a function to track the locations of the children.
When selecting the seats in the cabin during booking tickets, passengers will be able to see a picture of a child ' s head on the ground that is occupied by children between the ages of eight days and two.
Thus, those who do not want to fly next to the babies because of possible inconveniences associated with their crying may be as far away from them as possible.
The Internet users who use airline services were thrilled by the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One juder complained that a few weeks ago he was flying from New York to Doha, and there were three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator proposed the introduction of “reams for adults only”, expressing his willingness to pay for such a flight.
Many tourists have noted that they will now try always to select Japanese Airlines for their travels because they see nothing pleasant about flying next to a crying child in a closed space.
In the past, a woman traveling with a breast-feeding child had tried to placate the travelers during the Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She prepared a candy bag for each of the 200 passengers, each with an apology note.

Pavel Ustinov joined the pickets in support of the figures of the Moscow case.
Acter Pavel Ustinov joins the "Freedom All" series, which is held Friday at the President's Office of the Russian Federation in the Old Square in Moscow, which is broadcast by Interfax correspondent.
The series of pickets began on 18 September in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day ever since.

The supply of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times
In the Government of the Russian Federation, it was estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries under Russian food embargo had been reduced by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin by the Russian Federation, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries during the first half of the year 2019, compared with 3 million 442.2 thousand tons in the same period in 2013, reports Interfax.
However, the value of imported products has fallen to $226.5 million from $4 billion,975.5 million, respectively.
This is the supply of goods that have not been subject to embargo.
As indicated in the report, the volume of imported products has been offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.
We will recall that, by the end of August, the Government had extended until 31 December 2020 the rules on the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which were prohibited from entering Russia through counter-sanctions.
The document posted on the official legal information portal noted that the rules were extended for a further period of one year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Originally, the order to destroy sanctions applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Subsequently, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, joined the list on 13 August 2015, as of 1 January 2016, Ukraine.
Putin's decree on the destruction of the illegal entry into the country of “sanction” (products under the food embargo which Moscow imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has allowed the destruction of “sanction” food by any legal means.
As the sanctions of the West continued, the Russian Federation also extended its response.
However, products imported for personal use by citizens are not covered by this measure.
The prohibition does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption up to five kilograms.

In Chile, a telescope worth 1 billion euros began to be built
TASS reported this with reference to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
According to ESO, this week the construction of the building's dome, where the E-ELT telescope will be located, was officially launched, while the most expensive and ambitious ground astronomical project was being undertaken.
Its total value is estimated to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the construction of equipment and the building of the observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 metres.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments of 1.4 meters.
It's a huge mirror, and it's two supporting reflection surfaces that are 4.2 and 3.75 meters in diameter will help E-ELT get the first detailed photos of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and look for Earth's doubles.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surrounding Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Although the construction of the dome is only started, mirrors, scientific tools and other observatories have been developed by scientists, engineers and other specialists for three years, since the first E-ELT construction plans were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, with a total value of about Euro400 million, was awarded by the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
