The social map of the resident of Ivanov province is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes include the continuation of the public passenger travel benefit.
Since 24 September, arrangements have been changed for citizens to travel on a preferential basis using the social map of the resident of Ivaniv province.
According to the press service, the Government of Russia for Ivanov Province, the changes provide for the continuation of the public passenger travel benefit and bring the social chart system into line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 of the FZ on the National Payment System.
The social map of the resident of Ivaniv province is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
Thus, the replenishment limit is no longer set for travel but for cash, with winter and summer periods not exceeding 400 roubles in winter, and for summer no more than 800 roubles per month.
Social card holders will now need to monitor the balance of their travels rather than the number of remaining travels.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens would be 1/2 of the carrier ' s rate.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for the replenishment of the social map remains the same, between the 24th of the previous month and the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to maintain a detailed record of spending on the social map with accuracy to copies.
In addition, it is possible to recover credited but unexpended funds.
In addition, the scheme of inter-payment with carriers becomes transparent, as now half the cost of travel is paid to a citizen and the same amount is reimbursable to the carrier.
No commission would be required to pay any money on the map.
In turn, Vasilia Silkin, Deputy Head of the Road and Transport Department of Ivanov province, reported that more than 33 million social map trips had taken place in the region in 2014 and almost 25 million in 2015.
The regional budget for the preferential travel of citizens using a social map provides for more than 470 million roubles.
As at 1 September, reimbursements to this effect amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
During the 911 call, the teacher admitted to murdering a friend
During the 911-voice call, the teacher at Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that he needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there's a "soul" in the house that's alive, but it's probably upset, and said that the contact of the family of the deceased can be found in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prances' body and a note that was carelessly written on a white sheet of casting paper: "I'm very sorry I'd like to get it back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the authorities of Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who was leading two online courses at the University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then gone 300 miles to a university campus where the police believed he had shot and killed all the respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt on the threshold of his office.
The Chief of Police at Delta State University, Lynn Baford, reported that the university staff had heard of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb had made the right call 911 shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the authorities were still trying to create a single picture of the motive behind Lamba.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, helped to produce a portrait of a talented but possibly concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gothia, where Prance died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
He himself included Lamba in his book, in which he expressed appreciation for the “pretty people” with whom he had interacted in his teaching life.
They both taught in the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well about Lamb, Brandon Bievers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the school year 2014-15 about how he was struggling with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the University of Delta to grant him sick leave, saying that he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university recruitment rules meant that the doctor ' s degree, which had been so persistently employed by Lamb, would not guarantee his automatic appointment as a teacher.
The president of William Laforge said he knew nothing about the Lamb-Schmidt conflict, but "it's obvious Mr. Lamba had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
The police attacked the Lamb's trail after he escaped from campus when he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-calibre gun in the backyard of his house, one mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, reported the coroner of Washington Metel Johnson County.
His car with a running engine was still standing on the driveway.
It was not clear at once why Lamb came to this house, although she said that she thought he knew the people who lived there.
Lumb has grown in those regions.
Lamb began working at a university of 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12000 in 2009 and taught geography and education.
He received a doctorate in the teaching sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamba’s old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and cheerful man.
Carla Heirston told me she was 15 years old, and Lambo was 20 years old when they met with her friends.
She and her friends went to high school, and he was a class boy older who had been trying to teach her guitar for several years.
During those years, he was successful with women.
All the girls were hiding when he was around," says Hayerston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, Brandon's suburb.
Lamb and Prance must have been dating for some time by the time of the events.
At 911 Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lighting who lived with them in a brick house in Gothia, the other side of which goes to the canal.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
The former husband of Prentis, Sean O'Stin, reported that they had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and that they had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's totally depressed," O'Stin said about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he wasn't dating Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentis when he and Abigail both performed at a summer festival three years ago.
Then they played concerts together from time to time.
O'Stin said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender and co-facilitator of the entertainment programs at the well-lighted bar of The Julep Room in the suburb of Gothie, said that he had last seen Lamba and Prentis on the evening of 5 September, when Lamb had finished playing guitar and a mouthpiece for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and we were making fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very clever.
Schmidt, a dead teacher, conducted seminars for freshmen and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, as told by Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in the Emporia and was president of the student brotherhood and student self-government.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland on the evening of Tuesday, some 900 people, including university professors, staff, students and community members, participated in a candle-burning memorial ceremony.
Schmidt Liz's wife and Brother Jeff Schmidt were also present at a ceremony during which the university chorus sang the "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
The crisis is over.
It's a day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was assisted in the preparation of the Associated Press by Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in response to a police statement that Lamba had reached 911 post-Schmidt killings and that, although Lamb had referred to Prance as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married had not been confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that he will not hire as many staff for the holiday season as he did last year, while the child's toys and products Riteller assures him that he will allow staff and temporary staff to work more hours.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 who were hired during the 2014 season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would initiate interviews with applicants this month and increase the number of staff between October and December.
While the shopping season is getting closer before the holidays, companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have sufficient staff in the shops and to sell, ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about dating Princess Diana.
The premier of "Back to the Future" was a great event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting at the cinema waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and it fell on me -- Princess Diana's sitting next to me," he told me on the trailer for the soon-to-be-out documentary "Back in Time."
The film starts, and it comes to my mind that I'm literally at the distance of my arm and in one fake plot of dating Princess Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about the film "Back to the Future" includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as by director Robert Zemkis and executive producer Stephen Spillberg.
The premier of the film "Back to the Future" was held 30 years ago.
"To me," says Spielberg, "this is undoubtedly the greatest movie on time travel that has ever been made."
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
Head of the United Nations states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states in response to Russia's military support for Syria that there is no “war solution” for the nearly five-year conflict, and the increase in arms will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the United Nations once again called upon all participants, including the divided United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Mr. Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences in the Council, as well as among the Syrians and local authorities, had “insolved the situation”.
Mr. Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had shown in addressing the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
Eight results of a survey showing that Donald Trump isn't joking.
Some tried to put a label on it.
Others missed him, taking him as a joke.
And some people are demanding a scandal.
But as some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's position in the results of the interviews, they failed (until).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump in two-digit figures, and some are beginning to ask seriously what this means for the real estate magnet in terms of the chances of getting a nominee.
Of course, this is just the start of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
Experts point out that, at that time, in 2011, Rick Perry gave up his advantage to Herman Kane, who was gaining no state in his name.
There are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups such as the “Policy Activism Super-Committee” Jeb Bush, and the Economic Conservative Group “The Growth Club” recognize the unremitting power of Trump and begin to deliver their dollars in order to overthrow it.
Here are some of the data from surveys that show that the real estate magnate is not just an intermediate phase:
Trump's sympathetic ratings turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidature in mid-June, a survey at the University of Monmouth revealed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive attitude towards this real estate magnet.
By mid-July, that was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, that was 52 per cent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive attitude towards Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say that they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators are getting out of the way in the early stages.
The Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of Republicans there had a positive attitude towards Trump.
Two-thirds of those voting for GOP would make Trump a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of Republicans said that they either “excited” or “satisfied” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "disquieted" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say they would “be delighted” with 40 per cent of those who say the same thing about Trumpe).
Next level of delight?
Marco Rubio, only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republicans say that they will be “unsatisfied” or “dissolved” if Jib Bush's patronage becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 per cent of Republican voters throughout the country feel that the magnet has the right temperament to be president, as the ABC News/Washington Post survey showed on Monday.
The same figure appears in the country's first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of Republicans think he's the same person as the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 per cent think he's not the person who can be effective at the post, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament isn't suitable for the White House, according to ABC/post.
Republic voters get used to that idea.
When they wear their hats of experts, the Republican voters think Trump is serious.
To the question of who is the most likely winner of GOP nominations, four out of 10 said Trump was a favour, according to a CNN/OC survey last week.
That's not the case when four out of 10 put on Jeb Bush by the end of July.
Total disclosure: The GOP voters had no previous right magic crystal.
At the same time, in the previous cycle, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters find the Trump campaign convincing.
Even if Republicans were united around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that this spread is likely to have the advantage of Trump, while the non-supporting Trump is evenly distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a hypothetical competition "one-to-one" between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is almost always supported by the majority.
It outstripped Carli Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeba Bush by 19 and finally Rand Paul, John Cassic and Chris Christi by 33 points.
He's got a nobody with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate around him?
Ben Carson was rounding up a businessman at 19 points in a hypothetical "one-to-one" competition.
A little over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their mind.
A new survey of CBS/NIT on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the voters supporting Trump say they are confident of their votes.
Obviously, many things can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent said that they left the door open to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with a colleague-outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their mind are likely to pick Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump referred to immigrants from Mexico as “violent” two months ago in his opening statement, the topic of immigration became the most relevant topic of conversation in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pose will prevent key Latin American voters from being rebranding the Republican Party.
But according to the ABC/Post survey on Monday, six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts universal attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Frustration by the Government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on support from approximately half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday of the new ABC/Post interview state that they want a political outsider rather than a man with government experience.
And they're also offended by Washington.
A survey of Das Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, held two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with the activities of the Republicans in Congress, with 54 per cent “unsatisfied” and 21 per cent “in rage”.
The Government will decide the fate of pension indexes in October.
The Vice-Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Olga Holotz, stated that the Government is now looking for options to implement the Pension Indexing Act in 2016 to real inflation, and is transferring it to the WG.
She noted that a solution should be found by 8 October at the time of the submission of the draft budget for the following year to the Government.
In addition, Kabmin discusses the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the cumulative pension.
The hungry man noted that the amount of pension savings was 350 billion roubles.
Approximately the same amount is due to the full indexing of pensions for the following year.
According to the Vice-Prime Minister, there is not yet a final solution to the question of who should pay contributions for the unemployed.
The hungry person believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not fair that society pays for him.
The media had previously reported that there were two options for balancing the State budget in the chimney.
Why is it that they often get irritable and red for centuries?
And Tatiana Levashov, an ottalmologist, says,
Our ages are the widths protecting the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on it.
When we forget to clean up the age regularly, we often contribute to the development of blefaritis.
Output simple:
Don't three eyes with dirty hands, carry a special wet napkin for the century;
at least one to two times a day, clear the land of the harmful substances stored there in the day.
Cleaning procedures also need to be complemented by warm compressions of herbs (shalpheus, Roma) that fan the dense secret of salivary glands and then massage the ends of the century, which should be carried out by circular movements of the pillows of the fingers;
When washing makeup, don't use alcohol-containing drugs.
They dry and dehydrate the skin, and they further silence the secret of the salivary gland.
Pianyan claims that the Korean nuclear-weapons created an atomic warheads.
North Korean authorities reported that the country's main nuclear reactor, the Jonben nuclear complex, was operating “at full power”.
This was reported on the country's Central Telegraph Agency website.
It is noted that the DPRK is prepared at any time to respond to “the US aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “in terms of both quantity and quality”.
The last nuclear-weapon test was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
Plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have not been reported since then.
Pingyan claims that he was able to create an atomic warheads.
The DPRK has also conducted multiple mid- and short-range missile tests, writing polit.ru.
Girinowski demanded that the reference to fraternal peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Girinowski believes that reference to the alliance of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said that during the meeting of the State Committee, he reported "Russian News Service".
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even the athletes can't stand," said Zyrinowski.
It is the opinion of the State party that all four quarters of the line should be removed:
In the summer of 2014, Zyrinowski stated that the current anthem must be changed to “God, the king to keep” and the Russian tricolor must be replaced by an imperial flag, writing polit.ru.
Assad called upon all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
The President of Syria, Bashar Assad, called upon all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe is to address the refugee problem, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question was not that Europe received or did not receive refugees, but that the root causes of the problem needed to be addressed.
If Europeans care about the plight of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That is our view on this issue.
"That's the essence of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue to engage in dialogue in order to achieve consensus.
However, if we want real success, they cannot be achieved as long as people die, as long as bloodshed continues and as long as people do not feel fully secure.
“So we can reach consensus, but we can't achieve anything until we win terrorism in Syria,” Assad stressed.
We will recall that some 500,000 migrants, including those from Syria, arrived in the countries of the European Union during the year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world had been the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that thousands of extremists from the “Islamic State” group may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization prohibited in Russia may use the situation to establish their own cells within the EU for the conduct of terrorist activities.
German city dwellers had organized a holiday for refugees.
In the past month, Germany had become a leader in hosting refugees, although it had recently strengthened border control to contain their influx.
It is estimated by the authorities that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts call significant numbers.
Since early September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived.
The BBC correspondent, Jenny Hill, visited Darmstadt, where migrants receive a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbin debuts questions to the Prime Minister at the session
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, the Prime Minister is looking forward to his debut at the session.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, will shortly address the Prime Minister for the first time, acting with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak on the first of six issues in the afternoon; his statement is likely to be followed closely by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss certain meetings by leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr. Corbin as leader; it will take place after he has appointed a shadow cabinet and his speech at the Tread Union Annual Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader to remain silent during the performance of the national anthem on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain, has been criticized by a number of conservative members of Parliament and has been the subject of several headlines in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin ' s decision not to sing a State anthem drew attention
Mr. Corbin's Spokesperson stated that he had “standing in respectful silence” and had acknowledged the Royal Air Force's heroism in the Battle for Britain.
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the shadow office, reported Newsnight on BBC 2, that he would advise the Leborist leader to sing a national anthem “independent” from his conviction that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play Mr. Corbin ' s team, expressing differences on economic, defence and international policy issues, while less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant said that political differences would also be “caught” in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr. Corbin to the European Union and the Government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Tread Union Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at eliminating the very idea of restrictions as a whole.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that there was a “full clarity” in the party that it was only in opposition to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from Pound26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth Labour Leader to whom David Cameron will meet at the “courier's box” in the last ten years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who promised a different approach to politics, stated that he had “involved collective resources” in order to gain ideas for Mr. Cameron's questions and had received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from Islandton North said that the Prime Minister ' s questions were causing undue confrontation and that he would refrain from answering and exchanging colliding, instead promising to focus on serious issues, such as poverty, inequality and problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him with a prime minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also suggested allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, to discuss the matter.
As leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to move away from the political style of “armaric balagana”, often associated with the Prime Minister's affairs, but acknowledged several years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have become a key indicator of the leadership's views, their ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires major reforms.
"Done in Johannesburg"
Johannesburg Business Centre is a tough place for homeless people.
But one group of former streetmen found a way to develop a trade and earn a living.
"I was taken in Johannesburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the neighborhoods and make money for it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound2 goes up as wages go up in the U.K.
The Pound grew up with rising wages in Britain, and the FTSE 100 index was raised with the proposal to purchase SABMiller.
From May to June, British earnings, less bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared with the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009 and has been seen as a carry-over of forecasts for possible increases in quotations.
The Pound sterling increased by more than 1 per cent in relation to the dollar to $1.5505 and by 0.84 per cent in relation to the euro, i.e. 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index grew to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
SABMiller shares were highlighted in the general context, which grew by 20% due to the purchase offer from the competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together two of the world's largest beer companies, collecting brands such as Budweier, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry stock grew by 0.9 per cent against the encouraging news of a competitive group of producers of class lux Richemont products.
The latest data on Richemont sales exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - the key market for Burgerry - had begun to grow again.
Glencor's shares grew by 5 per cent after the mining giant claimed to have managed to get $2.5 billion through equity, which was done as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The stocks of the Mandi paper and packaging group were index leaders - 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's rating to “sale”.
The JD Sport shares increased after the sport clothing company reported an 83 per cent increase in profits prior to six months ' taxation to £46.6 million.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages can interfere with expansion
The Executive Director, JD Sports, Peter Kaughill, says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers”.
But it was unlikely that such purchasing power would outweigh the increase in labour costs, he said.
The cost could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, adding what might have meant a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metckash launchs a bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi
Mattsash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
An optical food supplier, on the initiative of the bottom, launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA Ritellers in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming injection by Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 shops in South and Western Australia early next year, Metckash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and at Adelaide Show-type events.
The campaign is joined by Ritlers and suppliers of IGA, such as the manufacturer of Simmo's ice cream from Dunsborough, who offers scaffolding at IGA shops, and store owners selling discounted tickets to permanent customers of the football League of South Australia.
Mattsash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on 29 September, a day when this wholesale supplier of food, alcohol and economic goods will spend its annual investor ' s strategy day.
Much has been said, since in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA markets account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash shops and show higher cost-effectiveness than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known to be followers of conventional routes, so the market is more favourable to IGA Ritlers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland -- more than 30 per cent in UA and 24 per cent in WA, compared with about 14 per cent in Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of its first shops, taking the sales from all the players present, but mostly from independent Ritlers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA Ritelers may lose $360 million a year and that Metcash will lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops next year in SA and 30 in WA with sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of profits and sales of food at a high fixed cost to Metcash could cost companies about 13 million revenue before paying interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat considered.
At the same time, Mattsash loses its share in the market in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and the Colosses, but a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA had the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, it is believed that the sale of Metcash food will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company ' s share of the market from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading stock manager, Hamish Douglas, founder of Magellen Financial Group, noticed that a business dinner in Melbourne was likely to disappear within a decade.
Mattsash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that Mr. Douglas was contacted by a member of the Metcash Board of Directors last week.
The share of IGA in the market fell from 18 per cent in 2010 to 14 per cent, and Metsash ' s income from food business, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA Rityelaires, fell by 43 per cent compared to 2012 owing to the operational développement and the pressure on sales and profitability.
Nevertheless, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million a year to balance retail prices with the prices of Colles and Volworths in a thousand positions each week, and helping IGA ritlers to reshape trading grounds, and offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider range of branded foods.
The Director-General of Metcash, Ian Morris, says that price balancing and trade conversions are gaining momentum, and he hopes that the company will achieve a net return increase in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis is supported by President Tennessee Australia, Steve Hili
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his conduct.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly injured in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more honor than critics, as President Tennessee Australia says.
Kokkinakis, Jr., in a talented duet and often called Special Ks, was involuntarily focused because of the shameful conflagration of Kirios and Stan Vavrinka at the Mont real Masters tournament.
Soon thereafter, during a hot qualification match in Cincinnati, the judge on the tower had to double-strike Kokkinakis and his enemy Ryan Harrison, and Harrison stated, "The Vavrinka was to be placed on Kirios' blades, and I have to put this guy on his blades."
Since Kokkinakis last saw a rocket breaker after the ship in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible US Open hit, Hill is loyally protecting Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grott for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomić in solitary confinement in the semi-final Davis Cup against Britain.
"I am deeply concerned about one thing, namely, that Tanasi was involved in the conflict," said Healy.
He really broke the rocket when he got his foot on US Open, but he's not the first player to break the rocket when hopes are broken, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But, in fact, he was very good at pretty provocative situations in the U.S., Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he's trustworthy.
He's surrounded by a great team, and he's got a beautiful family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's working hard, he's a great team member, he's never had any trouble with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's intensively trained, he's in excellent shape, he's a very dedicated and developed young man, and I think he should be valued.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match beginning on Friday, believing that mutual consent was the right option for all, but he hoped that a young man from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term player.
"Usually, we want the team to concentrate entirely on the match, not on the disputes around [Cyryos]," said Healy.
And I think Nick's gaining strength very quickly, as people like Federer and Marrey prove, he's growing up in front of the public, he's making some serious mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think I need to get him out of focus for a while, so that he can think about them, and that's the best thing for the team and the best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
Having declared a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detains those who attempt to enter the country illegally to keep the flow of migrants flowing.
On the border there were disturbances - hundreds of migrants had disappeared on the border territory, which had been reciprocated by the Serbian authorities.
In an uncertain time on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland broke their tents and settled in the area.
However, frustration has developed.
When a police helicopter circled over them, the migrants shouted “Open the border” and shouted insults against the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared “unacceptable” the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, with more and more arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution of the problem rather than the associated harm.
Negotiations should be held with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” Ivica Dachić stated in Prague.
The bombings along the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after a cluster of 28 countries was unable to formulate a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and hoped that an agreement would be reached in the future (the following month or by the end of the year) that the member States of the European Union would host another 120,000 refugees, including those from Hungary.
The chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, and Austria, on Tuesday, demanded that an emergency EU summit be convened next week to discuss the immigration crisis affecting the continent.
Hungary, however, does not look forward to rapid action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to deal with the crisis, enabling them to close roads and expedite asylum cases.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Minister of Hungary, Peter Sierrato, stated that his country was also planning to erect a barbed wire fence on the border with Romania to close the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were involved in urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main narrow spot and the EU border crossing point for settlers, many of whom are war-affected refugees in Syria and the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orbán, insists that most of the people who arrive are economic migrants seeking a better life than refugees who are victims of war, who are entitled to protection, and this view is sharply at variance with the views of other EU countries, Germany.
The new laws that entered into force in Hungary at midnight now consider it an offence to cross or damage a four-foot (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, as well as to include longer prison terms for the accused of trafficking in persons.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency”, said a representative of the Government of Zoltán Kovac in the southern city of Ségéd.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, Parliament should still authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected to take place next week, but reporters from the Associated Press who are at the border have been seeing the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs there for several days.
Djérj Bacondi, Orbán's National Security Adviser, reported the capture by the authorities of 45 persons trying to cross the border on the border itself, and another 15 others on the inside of the country.
They have crossed the border by breaking the fence and are currently in police custody and accused of administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passageways at the border with Serbia, blocking one of the aisles with a railway wagon wrapped in barbed wire.
The riots broke out at the main crossing near Rhooske, Hungary, as Hungarians placed a service space to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds pressed one another to get inside.
About 20 people were able to get inside, and thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road route leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced that food and water would not exist until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton ' s superiority over Bernard Sanders has been halved in the national survey
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit advantage in the democracy race for the country's name, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching it up.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support for primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders is the second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
The Vice-President, Joe Baiden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to take part in the presidential race, receives 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months prior to the initial election competition, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they have decided with the candidate they will support.
Clinton's supporters are more confident of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton retains a great advantage among women and moderates, but this advantage has decreased.
Her support for men had fallen significantly, and Sanders was only five points behind her.
Clinton's preference for democratic voters up to the age of 50 has disappeared, and he and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
Clinton, however, still has a great advantage among the older voters.
In the past month, Clinton overpowered Sanders by a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has an advantage of five points in this group.
Almost half of the country ' s primary democratic voters said that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if it became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would only support it because it was a candidate.
Six percent would not have supported it.
It may not be surprising that the current supporters of Clinton are likely to show more enthusiasm for her.
Among those who do not support Clinton at the moment, views are more controversial - only about a quarter of them with enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of the primary democratic voters said that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republic voters said the same about their leader, Donald Trumppe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters ask an open question about why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), then that now is the time of the female president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for that post (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also speak of an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
There are also questions and options for election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters would like him to join the race, although one third do not think he should.
When they are asked who they would like to see second place among party candidates, the primary democratic voters are mostly known as Baiden.
Among those who support Clinton, over half says they'd choose Byden for the second, that's more than Sanders's.
If Byden decides not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Byden to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of democratic voters saw a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning the general elections; however, that figure had fallen since 78 per cent last month.
By this Baiden figure, with a large backlog in second place, the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
Nevertheless, in response to the question that is most important in the candidate, democratic voters choose options other than the chances of being elected.
Similarly, last month, none of the candidates for democracies or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some of the key features of the primary voters of their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Baiden to be honest and trustworthy people of good leadership.
Byden of all three leads in honesty, and Clinton's strength is in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on it.
Primary democratic voters also generally consider the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Baiden to be similar.
In all these terms, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Although questions about the personal e-mail box and server at Hillary Clinton continue to be asked by its Secretary-General, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and feel that this has not adversely affected their general view of her.
But this is a completely different story for the American public at large.
Half the Americans today are not satisfied with its explanation, but only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided as early as March, shortly after that story became known.
Most Americans say that the debate about e-mail had no effect on their general view of Clinton, although 36 per cent said that their view of it had deteriorated.
They're mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 people who claim their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers the voters of her party to be honest and credible, this continues to be a problem for her among the registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider her to be honest and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of the registered voters do not consider it to be honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump, however, both receive good leadership marks.
Of the six candidates tested, Byden, Carson and Bush show the best results in honesty.
Most people see Sanders as an honest person rather than not, but, like Carson, many have no idea of him.
The limit of error for a sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
On the basis of the national survey, Ben Carson approached Donald Trump in close proximity.
Ben Carson came up close to Donald Trump in the last CBS/New York Times interview.
Two of these candidates won half the votes of the voters in the new poll, leaving everyone else looking for support underfoot
Republic voters throughout the country continue to support Trump, whose percentage of support increased from 23 per cent in a recent CBS poll held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in a Tuesday survey.
But Carson took off from 6 to 23 per cent in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups by raising Trump's strength in the group of Republican voters with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carli Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Kasic, retreated back with Governor Vicensin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Hakabi and Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, are together in third place from 6%.
The limit for sampling a sample of 376 Republic voters in this latest survey is plus-minus 6%, and the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed the growth of Carson in the surveys - showing support to 19% of Republicans at Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
With the increasing support of Carson last week, Trump made several critical incidents against the former neurosurgery, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of Baruch College freshman
About two years after the death of the college student during the dedication ritual in the Pokono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"Phi Delta Psy of the Baruch New York College severely attacked Chan "Mikla" Deng during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and failed to deliver him to the hospital on time, which resulted in his death," they reported to the police.
Officials say a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times while he was trying to achieve his goal by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The P.D.P.P. did not call 911 when Deng passed out, and he was expected to wait an hour before he was taken to the hospital and told the police.
They took time, however, to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google and contact Andy Meng, the National President of the Brotherhood, to ask the council, as Chief of Police Chris Wagner told the press conference.
"At this point, members of the brotherhood began to hide personal property, essentially by putting the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to save himself, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt injuries to his head, torso and thigh.
“A great deal of families have suffered as a result of dedication rites, as at least one student dies every year since 1970,” said Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brotherhood and their members must be held accountable, and this is an important step by the authorities.
Monroe jury counties have propped up charges of murdering the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against a newcomer and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to hold not only individual participants accountable, but if there is an organization that has authorized all of this formally or informally, neither,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College banned brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood expelled the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in the rates, and the bull market will collapse, the bond return will increase and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take before the arrival and how long it will last.
Specifically for the economy, history explains little about time.
The recession occurred only 11 months after the first increase in rates and for a whole of 86 months.
The stiffness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, albeit not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
The Central Bank of the United States, therefore, is so insistent that investors should not focus on how much they start to raise interest rates, but on how much adaptation takes.
In fact, there's a lot of variables in the game.
After all, however, market participants may find that the whole area of rising rates is exaggerated.
“The first increase in rates by the Federal Reserve, with the emergence of a global financial crisis, will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of an era of cheap money”, said Julian Jessop, chief international economics specialist in Capital Economics, in his commentary to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to a more normal but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy might have responded to historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, waiting for higher rates may lead to instability for some time.
However, the impact is usually less dramatic.
"It's not the same that equity revenues are suspended 12-24 months after the first leap, which again probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," said analyst Deutsche Bank in a recent study of the results of the Federal Reserve's appreciation of interest rates.
More specifically, the market has changed dramatically over the past approximately 35 years - about 14 per cent - towards higher rates, within 250 days (average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average return of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief trade strategy specialist in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
In Deutsche it is said that the result for securities is not immediately more pronounced at the rate rise stage, and equity revenues are beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but higher rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that did not exist earlier and that could accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be located at almost its lowest point during the time of the high rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of higher rates since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was lower than 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it to be long, but it is only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question of “whether this time it will be otherwise”, reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise Federal Reserve System rates throughout the year and their views are attached to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategy specialists and economists believe that FOMC could have approved an increase in rates at this meeting, futures trade suggests only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all cycles of interest rates until today have been in a supercycle of increasing financial leverage for GDP, covering peaks leading to recessions very quickly after recovery began," the report says.
In contrast, it was a very slow recovery following the worst recession in the period chosen.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting since the end of the last recession, with a record of 35 months, a total of 74 months, and not yet over.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market is waiting for higher rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to what is being realized for shares.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will be faster than for shares when the Federal System changes the strategic direction.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change the vector as soon as the first increase/reduce rates in the cycle have arrived.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, the bond return immediately falls,” reports Deutsche.
The strategy experts from Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will bring long-term and short-term bond returns closer together to make the curve more flat.
High-income bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we are still afraid of income fluctuations”, says a study by Cathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal System policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stronger monetary policy”, she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the return curve is flater, credit slots have increased, volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market, with the tightening of Federal system policies.
Generally speaking, companies with major business interests in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates, while local products will become more attractive.
International debt companies would be worse off as a growing dollar made their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt more expensive in financial terms.
“The history shows that `quality' shares demonstrate efficiency above the market within three months of the initial rate increase”, said Goldman Sachs analysts in the customer report.
Firms with stable financial status were affected by an average of 5 percentage points per increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Capital return companies, as well as low volatility shares, have also proven to be better off than low-quality shares by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big question.
High-interest, floating-rate companies will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely trading transactions, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts differ as to how fast this will take place.
"BBC Radio 3 - A copy of Classic FM" - claims by Andrew Bingham, Member of Parliament from Conservatives
Andrew Bingham, Member of Parliament for Conservatives, criticized the station for “the reduction of standards”
Proves that it's becoming less and less separate from a commercial competitor
He also targeted BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize was just given to the British.
The Demien Collins Parliamentary College, which struck The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM," said the leader of Parliament, urging the broadcasters to prove that they are doing anything that commercial companies are not doing.
Member of Parliament from Conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC leadership that the public radio station seemed to be “shocking” and becoming less and less separate from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "simplification" - but it seems to be turning into a Classical FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards awarded last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Bulbs under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- these are two examples that first came to my mind where you're really just copying what's already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The Director General of BBC rejected the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was well ahead of his commercial rival when it came to living music and the formation of an audience.
What I find out about Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and music is not really comparable to anyone else.
"It is also very important, I think, to the interest of Radio 3 in finding new music and moving new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davy argued that radio stations had to work a lot more to attract audiences than in the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC who had been attacked for attacking commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, the Media and Sports.
A member of Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of £22 million.
See why this programme is often discussed because of the lack of originality and distinctiveness?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George participate as judges, was made in a "typical BBC style".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to find a hit in her own home stable the next time she started a fun project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the ordering of new seasons The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the licence fee for other entertainment formats.
The growth of Internet sales slowed as fast as possible in August, and it might be the Black Friday's fault.
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase of 7 per cent in online sales
Last month there was the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that the Black Friday of November could have helped to contain waste
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs of equalization of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August showed a minimal increase since it began to be recorded in 2000, an increase of only 5 per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of equalization of online sales after the latest figures show only a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they've always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IRG sales index.
He explained that online sales had increased three years earlier, when buyers began to use their mobile phones to shop.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on a couch.
But now it's coming out on the plateau, and you can see the decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowing down of sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying before the event on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers were five times as quick to use computers to make good offers, thus closing down a number of salesmen ' s websites.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, when buyers go into a real fight for profitable purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retal Consortium, a little over £1 out of every £5 is spent online.
With regard to products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through Internet shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online than in fashion stores in the central streets.
Muslims bury those killed in the fall of the faucet in Mecca, and Ben Laden's family is subject to sanctions
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead in the streets, as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the accident on the construction giant Savid Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the tap was destroyed
Hundreds of Muslims have flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims killed as a result of the collapse of the faucet on Mecca's main mosque.
Dressed mainly in white, those present at the funeral filled the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went to their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A sad procession passed past a sacred place where only a few days earlier, a building tap had hit a ceiling of the mosque and had fallen upon a congregation.
The bodies were issued for burial and, at the same time, the King of Saudi Arabia fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 churchmen who died in a tap crash at the main mosque were carried in the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Kasim Akram of Bolton, the Grand Manchester, who was on his first pilgrim trip when the tap fell.
Mr. Akram was at the main mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the haj to Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that Binladin Group should not have left a tap arrow in a non-working tap.
The Arab version of the decree published by the Saud Press State Agency states that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the offence.
The English version of the news agency did not describe this detail, but reported that the leaders of the company were not allowed to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the tap’s fall into the courtyard of the main mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were streaming into the hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements on the breakdown of the tap and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and of not being properly coordinated with the Meteorological Service.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Main Mosque, as part of the large-scale construction work being carried out by Binladin Group.
The Ben Laden family has been one of Saudi Arabia ' s immediate ruling families for decades and is managing the largest construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Usama bin Laden, was a renegade son whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to engage in pilgrimages, which is compulsory for every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay 1 million rials (about £174,000) to the relatives of the deceased, and the same amount was irreparable.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q states that the trend is due to the existence of Eastern European masters who work for small sums of money.
According to Verona Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
Outcome: opening of more than 200 new Screphix shops for specialists
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q warehouses throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Chief urban correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to be putting the hammers and the malaria rolls aside and instead hiring qualified Eastern Europeans to do their work in the house.
If you can handle a hammer or try to paint walls, it seems like you're in a minority today.
Because, according to the owner company B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring master specialists to perform simple housework.
Véronique Lori, the new director general of Kingfisher, who owns a network of home maintenance services, reported that the trend was followed by a significant influx of skilled experts from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screphix shops specializing in craft products, while closing 60 B&Q warehouse shops.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in B&Q stores, since eight of the 10 shopping decisions in the shop were made by weak women.
At present, most of the staff are men.
She said that the latest demographic trends, characterized by the increasing number of single women households, which were more involved in the development of their homes than in the past, could not be overlooked.
Mrs. Lori said, "Our stores are still mostly male-dominated.
Action must be taken to achieve a balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women in charge of the leading British companies whose shares were recorded in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top managers team to equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the general and financial director.
Ms. Lori said: “It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
It was not difficult to find suitable women on the board of directors.
After the group incurred the costs of closing the shops, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales over a period of six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screphix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new shops.
Time of decision at the interest rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The world is observing a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, at which the crucial decision to raise or not to raise the interest rate for the first time in the last decade is discussed within two days.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who believed that the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believed that it would be more time-consuming and maintain the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, since seven years have passed since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero to start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy works efficiently, economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the impact of the decision on the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared for change, but everyone speaks of their confidence that all chances against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
“Open it” – hundreds of refugees are scandaling at the Horgosh checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for the settlers.
Asylum-seekers are already beginning to perceive other routes to the European Union.
One of them stands across the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
The other one, through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some data, buses carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading for the city of Shidou on the Croatian border.
Drivers were instructed by the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojsa Stétanović, assures us that his country is doing everything it can to help the refugees, but its capacity is limited:
Our work is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to ensure that they are treated humanely.
But it's already a pan-European problem.
It is difficult to resolve, and no country in Europe can do so alone, much less a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not wish to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is unflinching:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia they must fill in the necessary documents to do so.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country either, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already built a 175-kilometre fence along the border with Serbia.
But the Orban doesn't want to stop there. He's planning to build the same barrier on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
The Gospel of Maymarakis, "Europeans want to help us."
The Gospel of Maymarakis, for a number of years, was part of the law-based governments, which, in the opinion of the left, led to a financial crisis in the country.
Now he is a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, challenging Cypras.
A few days before the election, he met a journalist, Euronus.
Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronos!
Evangelis Maymarakis: Thank you for your invitation.
Euronius: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by giving up the SIRIZA coalition, but now, according to the polls, the New Democracy was as popular as it was.
What has changed over this time period?
The Gospel of Maymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Cypras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
The country now has a new fiscal deficit and high unemployment rates.
Investors left because Mr. Cypras drove them away.
In the last nine months, the Greeks had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Zipras.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what actually happened.
Daily life has been markedly worse than in January, when the situation improved, with the majority of Greek citizens.
But you're saying that if you win the election you're going to seek alliances with other parties, including SIRISU.
The Gospel of Maymarakis: The point is that, as we have seen in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, political forces and all ruling parties have met together to implement a programme on which they have reached agreement without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of the political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronius: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Zippras and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you implement the agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Evangelis Maymarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of the Greek movement on the European road, because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences that a country's withdrawal from the EU would have.
Europe now helps us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Junker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there had not been a deal with Europe.
But the current cost-saving measures were the result of Mr. Tsypris' negotiation.
I know Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government in the first year wants order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has strong political will to implement a rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments made, which cannot be fulfilled because of the resulting recession, can be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that, as early as the first year of operation of the new agreement, we will be able to resume negotiations with our creditors, as they look forward to the full implementation of the agreement.
If we are to regain their credibility, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to take advantage of EU financing and the great investment opportunities that we must offer for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Zippras Government has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have found by discussing these issues with our European counterparts.
I can give you an example of farmers' incomes.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore it cannot be taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Zippras had never said that.
I mean, the Greek Ministers were untrained and poorly informed, so they failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronius: If you win the election, you will soon be at the table with Mr. Junker, Olland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Evangelis Maymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we were trying to implement best the 2012 agreement by bypassing its sharp corners.
We have moved forward with reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted under extreme circumstances.
The market fell and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek government.
I was then the Speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then the majority government.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process was not interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronus: The recent weeks have seen a massive flow of refugees throughout Greece.
What do you think of this situation and the reactions of European countries to which these people are seeking?
Evangelis Maymarakis: The refugee crisis is the time bomb that we will be dealing with after the election.
The reason is that the SIRiza Government did not act in the same way as it should have.
Such matters should be proactive, for if the problem confronts you, only emergency measures remain.
And that's what we're in right now.
Even the interim government that replaced Siriza did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsypris did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim Government, which has received valuable assistance from the President of the Republic, who called for an EU summit, will lead to a solution.
We need to see how many refugees we can leave the country, and notice, refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are victims of the Syrian war, victims of some of the extraordinary events that have taken place with them.
There is a deep humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will adhere to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
A decision should be taken at the EU summit and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance received from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Gospel of Maymarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Dorkovka, Donetskka, during the 24-hour period, criminal investigation officers of the Department of Police in the province, together with military counterintelligence, identified and detained a suspect who was found to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Kriva Horn (Dnipropetrov region), who had fired an automatic gun at his opponent on the eve of the night before sharing alcohol.
A 22-year-old boy was reported to have been injured from a hospital where he was hospitalized with through-the-way gunshot wounds.
According to Artem Vasitzki, deputy chief of the Criminal Investigation Department of the police chief of the province, the law enforcement officials proved that he was involved in another serious criminal offence: the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operators found that on the same day, there was a conflict between the suspect and another local resident, resulting in a fatal gunshot wound in the head of the man.
Criminal proceedings have been opened by the Investigative Unit of the Druzkowski OG under the articles “intentional murder” and “intelligence of serious bodily harm” of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee is liable to 15 years ' imprisonment.
The officer was detained and placed in a temporary detention centre, and reported to the Donetsk Police Press Service.
Two inhabitants of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in the colour of the Ukrainian flag, including two of Vladimir Lenin's monuments, were sentenced to imprisonment by the Russian court.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to deprivation of liberty.
Novosibirsk prisoners were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years ' imprisonment.
Two other convicted persons received a 14- and 18-month restriction of liberty.
The Leninsky Court of Novosibirsk found the four citizens guilty of vandalism with respect to Lenin's monuments, which were located on the territory of the CDPF and on the street of Tricotska, as well as on the Memorial of the Memorial of the Glory.
In the latter case, Katyusha and T-34 missiles were painted.
We will recall that on the night of December 12, in Russian Novosibirsk, unknown men painted military equipment in the colour of the Ukrainian flag on the Momentum of Glory.
The civilian wife of popular Russian actor Evgeny Ziganov Irin Leonov gave birth to a seventh child.
The girl appeared in one of Moscow's clinics.
Newborn and her mother feel good.
We'll remind you of the recent breakup of Tsiganov and Leonov.
Eugenius refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions for everything.
Evgenia Zyganov is 36 years old.
He's an actor at Moscow's Petra Fomenko Master's Theatre.
He's known for the films "Protection," "The Cosmos as a Premature," "The Regional Strongness," "The Otteppel" and "Farza".
On 8 September, Eugeny Ziganov was recognized as "Accer of the Year" and "Aman of the Year" by the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
A man who opened fire at Delta State University left a note of apology.
After shooting and killing a friend of his in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he would “hear” the first murder and would like “all to return” to the authorized authorities on Tuesday.
Police in Gothie, Mississippi, reports that a professor of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta called 911 in the morning.
On Monday, and he said he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police should send people to his home.
He said, "Yesterday, I killed my wife" and he mentioned that there's a "dog" in the house that doesn't touch anyone, but probably upset.
The police asked for the name of the phone call, but he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shooting.
When the police came to the crime scene, they discovered Amy Prance's body there, 41 years old, and a 45-year-old note from Lamba, which said, "I wish I could bring it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb traveled 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday night, when the police surrounded him, he killed himself.
University Rector William Laforge reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite the information received on Monday that Lamb had envisaged a novel between Prances and Schmidt, the official services on Tuesday reported “no information or evidence” of the “love triangle”.
The Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who said that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prance had a daughter who was 19 and that she was "uncomfortable."
He added that Prentis and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay News, what San Herald calls a close friend of Prentis's, the last person worked from home on the Internet.
Noles told me that Prentis had a hunting dog called Lighting and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Noles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family at some point on Monday to say "he won't go to prison."
On the evening of the police hit him on the 1-way near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods, and got shot.
According to a summary posted on the university website, Lamb received a doctorate degree in pedagogy at the University of Delta in the spring of 2015.
Stars losing their luck
Akter (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), had endured several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his multi-year life companion Farru Fosette, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reported to have suffered from drug addiction and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this, of course, played its part.
Luke Shaw from the Manchout United got out for a few months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the game of the League of Champions, where the Manchester United lost the PSV in Endhoven.
While the defence counsel is concerned about this subject, which will prevent him from entering the field for at least six months, Louis van Gale hopes that Shaw will be able to play again during this season.
The trauma occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless sub-cat at 15 minutes when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penal zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double fracture and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or day later, and then he'll be operated.
It's terrible -- the young man came to Manchout United at the age of 18 and overcome a lot of difficulties and played fantastically, and it happened here.
He had an oxygen mask on his locker.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you've got a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy can't play the group stage.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno's lucky he didn't get a red card and he wasn't assigned a toolbar.
Nicholas Rizzoli's arbitrator didn't punish a Mexican.
Van Gale believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge yourself when I tell you it's worth the toolbar and red card.
It was a really bad run-in on two legs.
The Twitter of Shaw says, "Thanks to everyone for your messages, not to describe how I've been devastated, my path to recovery begins, I'm going back even stronger than I was."
Also on the topic: Manchout United is going through an accident with Luke Shaw in a PSV game.
The British defender will have an additional incentive to recover to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocoach, coach of PSV, said, "This is a very serious trauma."
When any player gets hurt like this, everybody's really upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the enemy.
Moreno moved his leg fracture while playing for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gale at the World Cup in 2014.
"It's very difficult for him right now, because he didn't intend to hurt the enemy, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, he feels bad," said Coco.
I couldn't see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball that flew in another direction, so it looked like he (Morno) touched it, but I didn't see a palate under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what this is, I know how difficult it is to endure.
I'm very hard, and I'm sorry.
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about "Lorax"?
Every parent takes one thing very quickly: If your child likes a book, it will take some time before you know it almost by itself.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question from a representative of a holiday organization regarding his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, an environmental story written by Dr. Suz in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment published on SuperCamps' website, and it goes, "This fun, moving, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children because it always reveals some kind of image or message that we're missing."
Everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to paralyse the contents of the book, but he actually tells the story of the one-named film that was filmed in 2012 with new characters and details added to give us a very brief original narrative.
"In a city surrounded by the high walls of the city of Mumbujville, where there was no green, and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart -- a girl of his dream, fulfilling her wish -- to see a real tree," we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Suze (the real name of Theodore Seusse Gazelle) who died in 1991.
If it seems not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of the film "Lorax" on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high-walled city of Westwood, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart, the girl of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as an active parent, is so familiar with the contents of a book in which the unnamed boy learns about the destruction of the environment by a greedy tree-sealer and the entourager Najdkins, despite Lorax's protests (whose name is given in the book's title) — a funny creature with a mustache who "speaks on behalf of the trees."
Perhaps such a simple PR task was assigned to an perpetrator who had never read a book about Lorax 20 consecutive times.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text had allegedly been received from the Cameron office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron headquarters, but no further comments had been received.
For Adam Litt, there was clearly a risk of not getting into prefabricated England, but it's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you look at the combined tour that England has chosen for this, it does not seem likely that I will repeat the strike in the 3-0 test series that occurred last time.
I would not rule out winning my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but among the reflectors there are players who are actually taking the rolls, and collective thinking is strong; they will not carry scars from 2012, but only the young man's positive.
With Myen Ali's ball, it turns into a bowler, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for the test level, is an attack option.
On the other hand, Adam Lit dropped out of prefabricated England on a test cricket and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to remove Adam Lita to me, his chief coach in "Yorkshire," of course, is difficult to analyse.
His seven test games had two good attacks under difficult circumstances, and the obvious but harsh reality was that cricket players were judged by the judges on the outcome.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for instance, which led to this announcement, because (and I said this earlier) the players are the best choice.
A couple of half a hundred, and Lithuania might have been waiting for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for "Yorkshire," there will be another possibility.
The chief coach of prefabricated England, Trevor Baliss, spoke well of his mood, even when he didn't show up what he was capable of, and it didn't surprise me; first of all, he's a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the betaman of the test cricket gives the impression is a complex question.
Lithuania played seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Compton was the only one who got the chance to play his own and somebody else's field.
The only thing you would like to welcome is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Prime League when Lithuania was in the best form, but this is a lost opportunity in the past.
Alex Hayles shows up, and he's a batsman that I appreciate highly.
He's an unpredictable cricket, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season, when he got 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was something already.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those before him, but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moena next to Cook as a opening baton, which would allow for the introduction of an extra spinner by retaining four speed bowlers, is thinking, and I don't mind.
I can't see the reason why a beat player can't hit a ball there, and this lion has already shown that he's a damn good cricket.
Moen may not be exactly what he needs for his county of Woostershire, but has become the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 "third batsman" test games before starting in 2001.
He won three hundred right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the prefabricated spinner, and with my brief interaction, he appears to me to be a very promising young man.
People can look at his example statistics -- on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think that's a risky rate, but among spinners who vote a little bit, and selectrs choose youth.
He'll learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the prefabricated, England is planning to make a few practical additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayaouordin, Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test matches, could be an exercise.
He's one of the best guys to play a game that will bring her the richest experience she's ever had in all circumstances and in all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games that use the white ball and will provide both energy and an unflinching pace in the grid.
I've always felt that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, whether it be a game or a coaching job, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what they said before, can give new strength to the team.
Colly's team, Darem Ben Stokes, is left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break in Australia, and for example I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, the coaches and the people who choose the players do not determine the timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
Britain’s camp for European Union withdrawal can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's thoughtless policy to resume negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is increasingly difficult every day, even without looking back at the election of brilliant Jeremy- "Is It Yes or Not?" -- Corbin as a Leborist leader or TUC's opposition to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbinas and Nigela Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained on the other day that in the current situation of the EU, which is experiencing a wide range of crises - not all of them own - some of the member countries have been fed down by the British self-centered agenda of conflicting concessions and undermining agreements that they generally do not want.
Having met in Brighton for the annual meeting, TUC decided that he did not want them in any case if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "Self Dave and George's program."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance ride at summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the background of a well-known local monument, in or without the company of the local celebrity, and then come home and say they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining external contacts with Britain under the shadow of the European Union — “Don't leave us with France”, says Berlin — suggests that the frozen ministers and officials in some capitals reach an understanding when they get to be, stay or leave.
Angel Merkel, a very cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she's in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before her situation deteriorates, as she's worse off for her 11-year-olds, Mitterrand (14) and Kola (16).
France's head, François Holland, stands before either re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland could soon obtain a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It's hard to see them coming out of the skin to help "selfi Brits," whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving Britain -- which they also don't want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan to issue deliberately useless SNP-style straps during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to stimulate Britain's exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
“The review was an idea-fix” and “Britain received nothing of value from resumed negotiations”.
Europeans know what kind of predator Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical of the EU media magnets are, unlike Tony Ben's referendum in 1975, which supported our entry into 1973 by the ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely recall Boris Johnson, a well-rooted Europortunist, famous for his “direct bananas of the EU” of a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a quick company of fearful scavengers, foreign telephone hackers and non-resident pseudo, which owns most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was quite the same about them, but he was aware that when you're in a cell with a big gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her from eating lunch and tea again.
In fact, Milliband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself was in the face of the Cameron referendum idea, as Blair accepted the principles in favour of the repealed EU Constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which issued him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him.
But Mile Jeremy Corbin, who was friendly to my back on Monday at Westminster -- I told him he no longer had time to spend it on me -- seems to be risking repeating Neil Kinnock's "Merdok's boycott" strategy of the '80s -- error, then and now.
It might take a while, but he has to develop a consistent strategy to interact with the press -- not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on whose couch on the Air Force he sat on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditional Ukip trend and a wider circle of small England's "partners" among the thorax might say yes.
That's the same thing as Hilary-Benn, but not Bennit-Benn said on radio and TV this week, and his internal boyscott refused to acknowledge that Corbin's appointment John McDonnell to be a "thin" Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought hard on the TV for his disloyalty to his colleagues in the Labour Cabinet, not going too far or losing his office in the Cabinet.
The Hilary battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain “under all circumstances” -- Benn's phrase -- is not what McDonnell said, nor is it what J.C. told the Pars and Members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, generally thought.
To inform democracy and Corbin's "his boyfriend" -- remember, he touched even me -- the discipline of messages remains important in the 24-hour television age seven days a week, especially in the watery social media, the hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to allow Cameron to withdraw from Europe so easily, allowing him to accept as his due support for the Labour Force during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbin’s major misunderstanding of EU membership - within the “Bennit” besieged strength economy - is no longer a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, caused by minor differences, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his errors regarding Nato - Tom Watson is unswerving that J.K. will not campaign for the exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on British concessions, when it might be meaningless?
The US has already been very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of Tori is cutting costs, which I was reminded of on Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes by Public Health England
Statements by a government-funded agency that 95 per cent less harmful than smoking were made at a meeting of 12 persons, some of whom were related to the tobacco industry, reported researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), together with Lancet, criticized the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) agency in their electronic cigarette report.
PCHE published an important report - a turning point last month called it a comprehensive review of the evidence.
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the relationship of some experts to the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month, a “extraordinaryly fragile argument” was criticized on the basis of which PHE built its main opinion.
In article BMJ, two more researchers asked whether these statements were “solid or irrevocable”.
Martin McCy, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: “The fundamental principle of health - the rules must be based on proof of effectiveness”.
According to them, the public expects PHE statements that “the current best assessment shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco” were based on detailed evidence analysis and modelling.
In fact, this is from the only meeting of 12 people to develop a model for multi-criteria decision analysis in order to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McCi and Capewell reported that one of the co-sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was reported to have received funding from the British American Bank for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT health certificates in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting announced funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he had previously received from Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the selection of Board members, but several prominent e-smokers were among them, some of whom also announced the financing of industry in publication.
It is not known if other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The head of the PHE tobacco service also visited the meeting.
A scientific article published by the group “concures very well” that there is a lack of “recognizing evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria”, wrote McCi and Capewell.
However, none of these links and limitations were addressed in the PCHE report.
McCi and Capewell reported that PHE ' s statements that "no evidence currently exists that electronic cigarettes are expensive leading to children or nonsmokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of the health and well-being field in PCHE, said that BMJ statements had previously been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two smokers died of his passion.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote consequences.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what the evidence does not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative risk of tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs NHS 2 billion a year.
Having clearly identified the obvious — that while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only cause part of the harm caused by smoking — we carry out our tasks before the nation.
Former chapter Channel 4 thinks BBC should stop East Enders
Former Chapter Channel 4 Luc Johnson believes that BBC should stop producing programs such as East Enders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would pay a lot for such successful shows as a soap opera on Alberta Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should be used only to create programmes that were not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized BBC for placing public broadcasting, which is probably only a small part of the audience, on peak airtime when competitors have high rating shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the Director General of BBC, Tony Hall, said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had tried unsuccessfully with BBC during his work on Channel 4.
“I can't get away from the idea that BBC prepares for launch and broadcasts broadcasts that could be shown by competing companies that don't receive grants”, told Johnson to the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of an examination of the future fate of BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then the company should only broadcast programmes that are neither produced nor intended to be released by other companies.
The Voice of the Voice is on the air in the prime solo, because the creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea of no one showing him again is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regression taxes should be used to finance transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one example, the East Enders is another; it's generally known that they're their own production.
Other channels would certainly have given much to her.
I don't know how it could be public broadcasting.
I don't think that would somehow humiliate BBC.
Johnson's serial businessman, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of pursuing ratings “because of staff ambitions and because of their belief that this is the best way to obtain long-term support”.
His comments on the most popular BBC show echoed the comments of Sky Tony Bolla, executive director, who, in his McTaggart Memorial lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, proposed that BBC sell East Enders series.
Johnson noted that the more niches of the BBC of a public nature “keep going on to BBC4 where it is often impossible to assess the audience, but the company's function is performed, and this can be argued in the Khane sermons that justify revenue from license fees of £4 billion: “Yes, of course, we do all these unintelligible transfers that no one looks at”.
They're putting them in a slot where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson informed the Committee: “I call upon you to find a more regression system with regard to who gets the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that £150 a year is a huge sum, but for people who have £150 a lot of money, I wonder, they don't think so because they don't look very closely and listen to BBC.
David Elstein, former executive director of Sky and Channel 5, who also addressed the committee last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of “information, enlightenment and entertainment”.
He noted that only a small part of the BBC material was now formally classified as educational - he said it was 1% of television content and 0.1% of radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the slogan “information, enlightenment and entertainment”.
On partnerships, Elstein noted that BBC should make more efforts in such areas as “Promenade concerts” (only a part of them appear on TV) and join alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available online.
"Snogenetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction as they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have produced worms with a genetically modified nervous system, which can be controlled by sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction at a time when they are influenced by sound impulses too high to be heard by the human ear.
Pulse effects by activated neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Another topic: The researchers control brain activity by light
Scientists said that worms demonstrate the possibilities of a new technique called “ssonogenetics”, which involves the use of ultrasound to stimulate certain cells in the brain, heart and muscle, and the source of ultrasound is outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a scientist at Soleka Institute, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this technique could once replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
The nematode worms don't usually respond to ultrasonics, but Chalasani found they started reacting when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that bubbles increase ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the body of worms.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves have an impact on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in some worm cells' membranes.
The ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open up and stimulate the cells that are connected to them, as reported in Nature Communications.
To create the nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasonics, Chalasani has made genetic modifications to worms, so their motor neurons used the ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasonics to affect modified organisms, sound waves were reinforced by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worm organisms by activated modified motor neurons.
This methodology is similar to that used in the “optogenic”, a new direction that allows scientists to switch on and off neurons by means of light pulses.
Chalasani argues that there may be advantages to Sonogenics compared with this method.
Unlike light delivered to the right part of the brain, low - frequency ultrasonic waves can easily pass through the body’s tissues, so they do not have to pass through the skull.
"We believe that in order to treat some neurologic diseases in clinical conditions, the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses will, for the time being, make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasonic signal," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique could be applied to muscle and insulin producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements are mocking the British arms trade.
See Amnesty International in protest of an arms exhibition.
Fantastic killing drones!
Destructive iron candals!
Cluster bombs!
Electric noise and light-bulbs that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The alert voice and the animated animation leave no doubt that this advertising of the largest international arms exhibition is a food parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British Government's intention to push weapons into repressive regimes, using an exhibition of defence technologies and security systems at ExCeL Center in Doclands.
Also on the topic: DSEI Arms Exhibition: authoritarian regimes going to London
But a special campaign has also led to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which require a look at them again.
"The important DLR announcement from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them in London Underground fonts showing the DLR line turning into a silhouette tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will be on line DLR. Passengers are asked to help prevent the display of weapons.
The 300 posters are painted by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Atrocities at Banky's Dismaland Park.
A group called the “Special patrol” team helped to distribute them across London using a “drive shoplifter”, a 6-pound package of carcasses, which reportedly “gives access to approximately one third of the advertising space at the bus stops of the planet”.
The London transporters are not happy with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized fasters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special patrol team.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the Cruel Developments exhibition and teacher at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and eager to bring political art to the audience outside the galleys.
Many artists are starting to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.

Amnesty's video was watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the pro bono VCCP with the help of a graphic designer and sound artist who is also free of charge.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around the arms exhibition -- with an ExCel pass -- and thought, "Let's get them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but “to fill her houses with bright colors and animation proved to be a more exciting exercise”.
"They helped us tremendously to draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take action and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on arms exhibition comes from within ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphetical products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed a request for "AT4CS RS for shoulder-fire" from the U.S. Army.
It includes a “unequivalent cumulative warheads which produce an unsurpassed armament within the target”.
Whatever he's doing, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules for Residence
It's been 11 years since I moved to the student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old man who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now that I remember the tense smiles of those I've beengrudged to -- and the many, long complaints about others.
Basically, what I've learned can be arranged into eight simple rules.
The move in the dorm may range from a slight nerve effect to a totally frightening one.
He urges you to talk: tell people where you came from, whether you took academic leave and where you spent it, whether you support Corbina and why you "honestly, neither love, nor hate "Marmait" because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract of the Hahaha, I'll be with you."
Take a rest.
And help others get some rest, too. Ask questions and show interest.
It helps you to find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if you had a firefighter, and they would give out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking facilities, dormitory cinemas, and common party places, but they are also a place where people dress and correct their underwear.
On the topic: Don't even think about starting university while you're in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room should be a haven, but many dormitories form a culture of commuting from one room to another, which fosters friendship, communication, and long friendships.
It could be hell for someone trying to regain power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue to make friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I've been able to restore the energy I spent on you."
Try to feel like a fellow student is tired of communicating, not knocking on him, but sending an SMS.
Speaking of which, knock: do it.
One guy in my dorm room followed the principle that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with your bakery.
As you start university life at the peak of the Bake-Off show, knock on the door to people to introduce yourself and deliver a plate of chocolate cookies, it's not that strange of the 1950s with their "We're neighbors, I've made something for you, and now smile and I'm gonna ask you personal questions."
Offering home meals is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, your face will probably be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are.
Badly blinded boils of flour, sugar, and fat will make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, it's stealing someone's chicken, but is it stealing to take a little milk for tea?
Work with the owner of the milk.
Most likely, he will invite you not to be shy, even if you are angry inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry for you, but try to treat this adult more than my neighbor who poured a dishwashing fluid into her milk to get revenge on those who took it out of demand.
She's in prison now.
You should not make noises that prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're the same people from the glass house talk.
A girl in my corridor asked a neighbor to turn off the drum and bass guitar sound, since it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased his volume.
When he finally fell asleep at 5: 00 a.m., she kindly allowed him to sleep for two hours and then hit her music and locked the door behind her while she went to the three - hour test.
Was it not romantic for your future mate to be in the same dormitories as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be unusual, before you bite the elbows, awkwardly, if you were to take a neighbor for your future mate, get into their relationship, break off their relationship, and have to see him every day, and perhaps watch him drag all your friends to his side?
Of course, you will not tell your heart, but if the hot neighbor is certainly not your prospective mate, try to cool your own dust a little bit.
At that exciting moment, when you realize someone left the keys inside his own locked room, the line between the playmate and the digestion is thinner than it seems.
Good play is fun, but it's the opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting lesson on safety by hiding something but never having to buy someone's room for toothpaste and shampoo.
Close the other door and put the keys in a glass of water that you'll put in the freezer -- but don't glue the other person's things with Blue-Tack to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on an iPhone after an update from Apple
A new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings application, selecting General, and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download it and install it.
Some experienced problems after installation when an error report appeared telling them that “the application could not be updated”.
In order to avoid this, users are encouraged to wait until recovery has been eased or try to update through iTunes.
The hints on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process.
The process could include removing applications to increase space - but Apple minimized the possibility of this action by reducing the update, and also simplified implementation by means of a special utility that proposes to delete the applications and reinstall them after the completion of the process.
You need to make sure that your phone is loaded or next to the charger when performing the upgrade to prevent battery discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update because the discharge of the phone during the process can cause the upgrade to fail.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
U.S. secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow was providing to President Assad led only to the escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague about it, writing PJ Media.
U.S. secretary John Kerry called the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss Russian military activity in Syria.
This is reported in PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that the continued support of President Assad on the part of Russia creates the risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, and also has a negative impact on our common objective of combating extremism, unless we also continue to focus on finding solutions to the Syrian conflict through the direct transfer of power”, said the representatives of the United States State Department.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the US's commitment to fighting the Islamic State within a coalition of over 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with the constructive role of Russia in its attempts to resist the Islamic State”.
Last Friday, White House representatives stated that they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
However, Josh Ernest, the White House Press Secretary, noted that the time for a telephone call between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet arrived: “When the president decides that a telephone call with President Putin will be in our best interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make that call.”
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime's “loss rate”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he did not heed my warnings -- and as a result the situation deteriorated," said the U.S. President.
The imported yachts will be exempt from the payment of customs duties.
The mini-economic development will temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means of recreation and sport from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Laskin, reported on this.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of the Russian Federation, following his visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of agencies - the Ministry of Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the Russian Federation - to prepare proposals to create an enabling environment for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, the experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about 200 million a year go into the treasuries of European States for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission “On the amendment of the list of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes”, which provides for the granting of full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means of rest and sport.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for the development of the yachting in the coastal areas of the country, as noted by Lashkin.
This issue was brought to the attention of the Subcommission on Customs, Non-tariff Regulatory, Protection Measures in the Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies as a result of the discussion.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Development, the proposed measure for full conditional release on import was essentially a benefit.
Therefore, following the adoption of the protocol, the meeting of the Subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation of Minéconomé will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member States of the EEA, Laskina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to facilitate external economic activities and international cooperation, for applications in science, culture, filmmography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, and others include office equipment (staff computers, typewriters), control instruments, drilling equipment, stage suits and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and religious objects.
In the Ministerial Press Service, Izvestiya, the Russian Federation reported that it had issued binding regulations on the seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Theodosia and Eupatoria, which provided for the simplified procedure for the setting up of a meeting and the departure of small-scale, sporting sailing and pleasure craft to the seaport.
The Ministry has instructed the captains of the Crimea seaports to ensure that the simplified procedure for the entry of small-scale, sporting sailing and pleasure craft into the seaport and for the departure of listed vessels from the seaport is applied.
The Ministry has also prepared draft regulations for the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the limits of the Crimea seaports.
With respect to Yalta and Theodosia, orders have already been issued and others are in the process of being agreed upon, as noted by the press service of the department.
In the view of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol should carry out the registration of small-scale vessels used for non-profit purposes.
The problem is that in Russia it is precisely because of poor infrastructure that makes it extremely difficult for yachting.
If you look at South Italy and France, it's a growing industry that's got a lot of people involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast has little interest, the only piece where yachts can be exploited around the world, is the Black Sea in Sochi, Hellendzik, Novorossiska, Anapa.
But the big problem is that in this area, the very strict rules of the border service are that, in order to get out of the yacht, a mass of permits is required.
Besides, inside Russia, the yacht is not even a place to fill.
She can go with her fuel for two days and then have a problem finding a place to pick it up,' says Nordmarine Denise Novikov, director of sales.
With regard to yacht storage sites, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special yacht hangars up to 30 m. The yachts are also deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers were rich people, but the demand for yachts had declined since the start of the crisis.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a $500 million loan.
The World Bank approved a new project loan for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“New funding will support a number of priority measures in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, the communication states.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Qiao Fan, stated that bank sector reforms would help restore credit in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that the first signs of stabilization had been observed in the World Bank.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
In the past, the Polish Government approved a loan to 100 million Ukrainians, transmitting RIA News.
Prisons are asked to establish separate units for trans-genders.
In October 2015, the Public Council of the Federal Prison Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicted persons, among other issues, will discuss the possibility of establishing separate units in the colonies for trans-genders and transvestites.
This was told by Councillor Vladislav Grib.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-sex prisoners in Russia, it was possible to provide for separate cells, blocks or even (if there were many such criminals) in domestic prisons, with a view to establishing a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is not possible to determine whether to serve the sentence of citizens in such isolated places until the convicted have received appropriate medical examinations that prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
The proposed practice, he said, had been successful abroad: SIZO (where the accused were pending a court decision) had separate chambers for transgenders and special units in correctional institutions.
It's the only way to work with criminals like this today.
They clearly need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgenders in ordinary cells is dangerous to them, it is the suffering of their families and the problems of the sea for FSIN staff.
The humiliation of trances by cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, the number of criminals with uncertain genders needs to be calculated where to distribute them.
SIZO doesn't need any of these things -- just cameras, blocks in jails.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgeners.
The Grib explained that 50 or 100 persons could be held in the block and that if a specialized unit was established in Russia alone, the transsexual prisoners would be able to serve their sentences in any region.
Citizens are held in SIZO at the scene of the commission of the crime, so the arrival of transvestites or transgenders from other actors during the investigation and trial is not realistic, but the introduction of such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes - is considered by the Ghrib.
It will be recalled that law enforcement officials were unable to determine the detention centre, male or female, for drug possession of a 24-year-old transsexual, Dimitri Koukanova (known as Aliena Davis), which resulted in the arrest of a man with a girl-in-law.
He was released under a non-departure signature.
This news has been widely discussed in social media and networks, since there is no mechanism for holding transgenders in SIZO and colonies in Russia.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT movement activist (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolay Alexeiev supported the idea of creating special places to serve the sentence by transgeners, noting that it is also possible to define people in colonies - male or female - according to their own will.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yeah, it's a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as is the issue of security for homosexuals in prisons,” says Alexeiev.
Prisons must be safe, so individual blocks could be done for this and for homosexuals, especially since they are more in prison than transgenders.
At the same time, Alexeiev is in doubt that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to pretend to be trans-sexuals in order to get into a different state than the ordinary colony.
Of course, a medical examination could be introduced before placing people in transgender colonies, but things don't always happen.
For example, in the United States, a prisoner in Chelsea Menning looked like a man, and he said in prison that he wanted to change sex, said Alexev.
A person can feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve the sentence for transgenders, I doubt the prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people and be aware of the subtlety of their orientation or sexual identity.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders to a colony could greatly delay the commencement of sentences for convicted persons.
A commission is being set up - it is a question of sex science; psychiatrists carry out long-term observations - it is not a single test on which high-quality detention is based.
Today's possibilities for psychiatry allow that.
So before changing the floor, potential patients are always being tested -- they're showing exactly whether a gender change is a surgical intervention, says Lordipanidze.
It is difficult, however, for me to imagine how this system can be applied to convicted persons, since it takes an average of one month to do so.
The doctor, while generally supporting the idea of establishing separate units for transsexuals, also doubts whether it would be appropriate in the current economic context to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, transgender units in Russia.
It's hard to estimate, there's no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it can be said that transgenders are even smaller, and those who have such a deviation and commit crimes are very few,' said Lordshipidze.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals and transgenders can obtain separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the world’s U.S. U.S. chess championship.
In Hunta Mansysk, the world chess championship was completed by 20 years of age.
The end of the succession seemed more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in his last tour, and became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who was able to do the same for Jan-Kshistoth Doudou, who seemed to be on his way to the title.
The girls were celebrated by Ukrainian chessman Natalia Buchs.
The chess championship of the world, held in Hunty Mansisk at the beginning of September, by the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all its intrigue, as Polish representative Jan-Kshistoth Douda, who issued a series of four wins (the competitions were conducted through the Swiss system of 13 tours), had taken over leadership with confidence.
Given that Douda was one of the most promising young chess players in general, it seemed unlikely that he would miss out on it.
And even when Douda cut back and allowed Russian Michael Antipov to reduce the backlog to only 0.5 points, he remained a clear favour in the struggle for title.
Because Antipasov had to win the 13th round to catch up with the leader.
But it wouldn't even help if you won Douda your party.
Plus, this obligation to win could, of course, have affected a Russian chess player's game and led to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipous managed to avoid them.
He did his job with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he had to wait until his party ended Douda, who had met Benjamin Bock.
Fortunately for Antitova, the Polish chessman fought the Dutch student.
Thus, Antipov and Douda gained an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible points - but Antipov had better additional indicators.
That is why it was his leadership of the Hunty-Mansian Autonomous Region, whose Governor, Nataly Komarov, traditionally devotes great attention to the development of chess in the region, that gave the main prize.
There was no intriguing ending in the competitions of the girls.
The leader of the tournament - Natale Buchse (Ukraine) - would not have lost the last round in order to win the title, which she had done successfully.
So, the victory of the Russians of Alina Bivol wouldn't let her catch up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained the second one behind the 0.5 point championship.
The millstone changes the regional structure.
The company unites the Privoljan and Ural regions into one densely populated Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East into the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
Mikhail Slobdin, the director of the Wimpelcoma, notes that changes are being made “to remain a strong player in the market”, to develop a company “in a new, not always favourable external environment”.
In an interview with the Russian 24 channel, Mr. Slobdeen specified that they intended to reduce “ten percent” of the staff in Russia.
Rubber checked 78 Moscow Burger King's snacks and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the Volokolam Road restaurant was fined 50,000 roubles and the large Tul Street facility was closed for 90 days, but resumed after all violations had been resolved.
43 diners violated the requirements for the construction of premises.

Polymetal is considering a possible net calculation with Sumeru Gold B.V. Instead of performing a $300 million full share option, the gold mining company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of shares in favour of Sumeru and market quotations) that can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has time until 3 October to implement the option or to request payment.
The details of the negotiations in Poleymetal are not disclosed.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of the “Kysil” project by Polymetal in Kazakhstan.

The drafts of the film "Citizen Kane" will be tendered.
Representatives of the auction house Profiles in History reported plans to tender black versions of the film "Citizen Kane", which is considered to be one of the best works of film director, writer and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will begin in the city of Kalabas on 29 September and will present three black versions of the scenario, the estimated value of each is $20-300,000, and the AP will be passed on.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevic, is the earliest scenario in private collections? It's called "American", which was the working name of the film.
The second draft is a more complete version of the scenario, the third and final plan of the film.
Minpromorg: Targeted food aid will not be the equivalent of cards in the USSR.
Vice-Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evtukhov, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be the equivalent of the food distribution card system in the USSR.
These include modern targeted food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to try the word "food card".
I should like to point out in particular that there is no need to confuse the proposed product maps with the response to the total deficits of the past, the distribution system, where the number of products received is normalized.
So far, we've proposed a concept, if it's approved, we're going to propose legislative changes," and TASS says Mr. Eutuchov.
Previously, I had written that the food card programme for the poor had been introduced into the Government.
For details on the Minpromthorg initiative, read "Igor Shwalov" in "Igor Svalov has commissioned the preparation of food cards".

President Alexander Bobresov is leaving his post.
The Vice-President of OAO, “Russian Railways” (RWC) on corporate security, Alexander Bobresov, leaves the company, reports Interfax, referring to the source.
The Russian Vice-Prime Minister, Chairman of the Council of Directors of the RWC, Arcadi Bulković, stated that the question of the withdrawal of Alexander Bobresov from the RWC had been initiated by the new head of Oleg Belozer company.
According to the Vice-Prime, the change of personnel in RWC management is not related to the change of the head of the company.
Previously, I reported that in place of Vladimir Yakinin OAO, the RWC was headed by Oleg Beloser, the first deputy transport minister in charge of the financial unit.
The new head of the company announced reforms in the monopoly for the first time: within a year and a half, a new system of freight tariffs would be established.

This year's study of the Association of Russian Managers, Top 1,000 Russian Managers, is published 16 times.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian high-level managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers in the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of a rating of last year's laureates.
Last year ' s winners are invited to confirm their participation as candidates for this year ' s rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list is invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies who would be usefully added to the pool of candidates.
The following business managers may be nominated: Finance Director, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, Staff Director, IT Manager, Public and Corporate Relations Director, Government Relations Director, Corporate Governance Director.
Each proposed expert manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to present his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of industry candidates is based on the industry classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, timber and processing industries, engineering, media, steel, multi-sector holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, services and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complexes.
Each participant is provided with a log and password to access www.top1000.amr.ru, where they can see information about the other participants and can present their estimates on the criteria proposed for each functional area.
The rating methodology is based on the “Best Choices for the Best” principle: top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle provides the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating shall be approved by expert commissions.
All candidates for this year ' s ratings and multiple past-year ratings are invited to attend the expert commissions ' face-to-face meetings.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: the Commission for the approval of the list of top managers and the eight Commissions for the approval of the heads of functional areas.
Meetings of expert commissions are invited to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (places are strictly maintained according to the Internet assessment and are closed until the rating is published) or to update them in accordance with the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules of Russian and the rules of “Happy”.
At the time of publication of the rating, there may be changes in the status of managers and companies.
The investment rate is 10-13%.
Experts estimate that the small and medium-sized business credit market in January-April this year was settled by 40 per cent.
What do you think the situation is today?
Since the panic of the end of 2014 - early 2015, IAS lending has declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
No one benefited from the 25-30 per cent loan.
If the bank had previously been able to place all its possible problems in the future, from delay to non-recurrence, it was impossible to do so: the rates were already cloudy.
For business, the current level of IAS credit rates is uncomfortable.
For a large part of the investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their cost-effectiveness.
A rate of 10 to 13 per cent would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and create attractive returns.
How far do you estimate business demand for credit is met?
The situation has improved somewhat since the fall of the CB interest rate.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers have begun to apply for credit much less frequently.
First of all, business does not understand its development prospects and future incomes.
Business today has one solution: it is necessary to learn how to work, based on today ' s economic situation in the country and the region.
There was a need to monitor current results more closely, and to monitor the flow of money.
At the same time, where financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this, in the long run, enables companies to make products more competitive and maintain business even in a fragile economic situation.
What are the main trends in the IAS credit market that will be consolidated and will affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The projection of lowering the average rate will depend largely on the policy of the Central Bank, and the regulator is now demonstrating consistency in reducing the key rate.
However, it is not worth waiting for the IAS to radically drop its credit prices.
In the current situation, inflation is primarily a problem, which makes a necessary higher interest rate necessary to generate real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even when the rates of the CB are lower.
In terms of the level of delay, traditional small and medium-sized businesses, limited both in cash replenishment and in economic behavioural adjustment options, will undoubtedly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is written in Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautiful, concise, and yet difficult for those who get used to the cyrillian or the Latin.
So is the new CX-5 crossover, as is any other model of the mark: unsightly attracted from the outside, technically perfected inside.
Japan is already simply because of its “Japanese” ability to bring its attachment to the products of the rising sun to the state of full delight.
You can do as much as you like to argue in favour of cars from other countries, and a person will even agree, in principle, with these arguments, but the whole conversation will end with the final phrase, "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people must probably love not only technology but all other Japanese things.
To quote from the path of Basé, to season the food of the Vasabi, to collect the skaters, and to wear your girlfriend -- no, not in the kimono, of course, but on the canons of the Japanese street fashion: soap, creativity and very suddenly.
Perhaps Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls enjoy after school.
It has amazing properties, both sensitive and rigid.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is the grid of the radiator with five horizontal lines.
But far more powerfully, the car’s face is being changed by a new drawing of the headlights and rearlights, where the vehicle will be instantly recognized in the traffic.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
Silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensitive, but the appearance is rigid.
You don't have to call the police.
The CX-5, one of the safest in the world, is only the Stoic Japanese calm.
The 2.2 litres diesel engine provides a high torque at a wide range of speeds.
However, the engine fuel consumption of 175 litres is only 5.9 litres. The power unit of the exclusive automatic transmission and the full transmission shall be assembled.
Black boots, black cloaks, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can pick the lungs from the police tape Not Cross.
However, in Mazda, every effort was made to ensure that you were not in the presence of your own accident under CX-5.
In order to further improve comfort while maintaining good control, the suspension re-designed the design of the front and back shock absorbers and optimized the shape of the front lower levers.
The full drive system has been adapted to Russian conditions.
Noise from road and engine at high speeds is reduced by 13 per cent.
A bather in a flower or a strip is as bored as a budget sedan.
It's different if the girl blinks in a bath with the original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in a role-player's genre.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved the design of both front and rear seats, which provides the best reserve of space for both the broad shoulders and the long legs, who owns what they have.
A long - legged one will no doubt appreciate that the top of the central tunnel is now soft and does not hit the ankles in the images.
The broadest set of active security systems for Mazda is proposed on CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to recognize potential threats.
There's both adaptive lighting and warning of coming off the lane, and monitoring dead areas, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
A convenient, minimum performance, containing a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are composed of a ratio of 4:2:4 - each section has a separate lifting lever - and increases the luggage compartment to 1,560 litres.
The hero's suit of cartoons in Japan is called kigrums.
It's especially expensive looking like pajamas.
It's got everything in it!
Of course I'm sleeping.
But it's also about entertaining little kids.
Or just walking through the street with such a beast...
Because it's so great when you've got a choice - fun clothes, manners or cars.
Thank you for helping with the preparation of the Kawaicat store.
Kiev broke the atomic ounce.
Kiev formalized Ukraine ' s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the development of the Khmelnica nuclear power plant.
The Supreme Council on Wednesday, since its second attempt, still voted in favour of evading the agreement with Moscow.
The arrangements for the restructuring of the third and fourth blocks were signed as early as 2010-2012, but the project was never initiated.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed a law which avoided the 2010-2012 agreement with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth bloc on the Khmelnitzka Nuclear Power Plant.
The Government ' s bill was only passed with a second ballot, for the first time supported by 210 members of Parliament at a minimum of 226, but was subsequently re-elected by 234 members of Parliament.
The initial Hmelni nuclear power plant under the USSR was to have four power units of 1 GW with WWR-type reactors, but only two had been built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the improvement led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010 and, in 2011-2012, the Council adopted relevant laws.
Since no funds were available in the Ukrainian budget, it was assumed that blocks would have to be built for credit from the Russian side, but no funds had been allocated.
Following the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling of the two countries, Kiev began to sever relations with Moscow in the atomic industry, declaring its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitzk Nuclear Power Plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area in which relations remained remained the procurement of fuel in the Russian Federation for existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (which provided about half of the electricity generation in the country), as as long as Ukrainian NAC Energoat replaced Russian supplies with nothing else.
Plans for the upgrading of the Khmelnica nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been finally abandoned: as early as 2014 in Kiev, talks with the Czech Skoda JS have been announced.
UN Gensel against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported during a press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
“Military solution is not available”, his reply to the question of Syria's military support by Russia is provided by AP.
Ban Ki-moon also reported that he would meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the M.D. of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be over Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Vice-President Genstab of the Russian Air Force, Nicolai Bogdanowski, reported that Henstab did not preclude the establishment of a future military base in Syria.
No such plans yet.
"But it can be anything," Mr. Bogdanowski said.
Previously, the U.S. reported that it did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in the Russian Federation.
For more information on the U.S.'s doubts about Russian assistance to Syria, please read "The Russian military presence in Syria is concerned Washington."
The OSCE PA reports a possible meeting of parliamentarians from Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Parliamentary Assembly, Arthur Herasimov, reported on the possibility of meeting bilaterally this year with Russian fellow parliamentarians to discuss the situation in south-east Ukraine.
“What I know is that a meeting is planned this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations”, Mr. Gerasimov says.
He also called for the implementation of the Mine Agreements and “to return to the normal lives of our countries”.
On the question of whether, in his view, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, “the Norman format” or the contact group at the OSCE PA site, Mr. Herasimov, had observed that the dialogue had taken place, there were Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to policy, there is support for any kind of dialogue in Kiev.
Previously, the representative of Ukraine to the talks, ex-President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine, said that the self-proclaimed Donet and Lugan Republics had not changed their positions in the tripartite talks, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Lower Novgorod Electoral Commission summarized the municipal duma elections by allocating 12 deputies ' mandates on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral irregularities have been made by the representatives of the CRC, who accused the selection of “falsifying”.
The opposition ' s comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the Communists of Russia refused to organize a referendum concerning the cancellation of charges for the capreating of apartment houses.
The city sample officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of Lower Novgorod for the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1.03 million voters were included in the electoral rolls in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand in the ballot papers and 268,000 in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among political parties, depending on their votes.
On the lists of "One Russia", six seats in the Gorduma are held by Dimitri Swatkowski, Dimitri Krasnov, Vassilia Shupranova, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteriev and Igor Nagorny.
The sole mandate of the LDDP was that of the leader of the Vladimir Girinowski party.
The two mandates of the CRC are shared between Vladimir Bulanov and the Deputy of the State of the State, Alexander Taraev.
The three mandates of “Fair Russia” are given to Alexander Razzomsky, Igor Bogdanova and Mikhail Shalugin.
It is now up to these candidates to determine within five days whether they will serve as deputies in the city ' s dune: if the mandate is abandoned, it will move on to the next portfolio candidate.
The Chairman of the Mountain Committee, Alexander MacKev, informed the members of the Commission that he was introducing “telephones of Girinowski and others” for the purpose of abandoning mandates.
When adopting the electoral protocol, the representatives of the CRC stated multiple violations.
The member of the Gorysbergecoma, with the right to speak for the CDPF, Leonid Krasnokutsky suggested that the vote in four districts No. 21-24 should not be accepted, recalling that the entrance to the administration building, which had four district commissions, had been closed by order of the Head of Administration of the Sormov district.
There could not have been a long time for the members of Gossoudma, for the candidates themselves, or for the observers, and a resonant scandal with the administration's doors stormed was shown on television.
All observers and members of the commissions with the right to speak have had the opportunity to attend the meetings of the District Commissions.
They were denied access by the head only when the vote had ended and the district commissions had not yet arrived to hand over their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"The chapter was then amended, and interested persons could be present at all the meetings," steamed a mountain member named Natalie Andreushin.
The Communists objected that in the blocked administration building more than four hours had been illegally detained by Mr. Ludmil Aristov, a member of the Zakla District Assembly, on which a statement had been sent to the Investigative Committee.
The opposition was also outraged that, in a number of ICUs on election day, the ballot boxes began to be sealed at 6-7 a.m. with early ballot papers.
In the meantime, members of the commissions with the right to speak and observers had not been notified, so they had reached the beginning of the elections at 8 a.m.
The Communists believe that during the morning hours before the opening of the polling stations, ballot papers could be dropped out of control.
However, the mountains, which had already dealt with more than 124 complaints of various reasons, according to Alexander MacKaev, did not find any violations of the inclusion of unaccounted for ballot papers.
The commissioners did not support the proposal by their colleague from “Fair Russia” that Maria Popov should go through the lick with the amendments of regional legislation to clearly determine the opening time of the envelopes with the ballot papers, which would then fall into the box.
"In order of your own initiative, at least contact the CEC," advised Mrs. Popov Alexander MacKev.
At the end of the meeting, Sergei Samhin, a member of the CDPF, was severely accused of ignoring dozens of complaints and covering electoral falsifications.
"You're not here at the rally, be careful to speak up!" the Chairman of the election was offended.
As a result, the protocol was almost unanimously adopted.
Before 27 September, the sample must approve the overall results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the city dunum of the Lower Novgorod of the Sixth Assembly will be scheduled for three weeks.
In addition to defining the results of the elections, the city's electoral commission refused to register the initiative team for a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were about to raise two questions for the discussion of the under-urbans: do they agree that the charges for capping apartments should be “immediately lifted” and the tariffs for housing and utilities should be “frozen until 2020”.
However, the lawyer for the Duma, Irina Maslova, explained that the application of the “Communists of Russia” was contrary to the law.
FedEx's revenue is mixed, lowering projections by 2016.
FedEx reported the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced the annual revenue forecast due to the drop in demand for freight services and increased costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it planned to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time, FedEx reported last year that he would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares were cheap at about 2.5 per cent of the provisional tenders 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp stated that he planned to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous projection.
Analytics were expected to be $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast is decreasing despite an average rate increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and the increase in charges for the surface transport of heavy or large cargoes, which begins in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase revenue over the previous year by reducing expenditures, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
President and CEO, Fred Smith, stated that the company had “functioned steadily in view of the weak economic conditions, especially in production and world trade, as compared to the forecast.
The employment plans for the holidays were announced the day after the competitor, UPS, that they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about as many as they had been hired last year.
In the quarter ending on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, an increase of 6 per cent over the previous year.
The share income was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per share projected by the Jacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the international fixed-term transport sector, resulting in a lack of growth of gross income in its rapid transport unit.
However, the Internet shopping boom dramatically improved FedEx Ground results.
In the last quarter, land transport revenues increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained largely unchanged owing to increased costs of large shipping and self-insurance.
The express transport unit earned higher revenue due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector income fell owing to higher pay costs.
In the preliminary tenders about an hour before the FedEx share exchange was opened, it fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday by 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
At the most recent meeting in a few years, the Federal Reserve leaders will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from Honduran redwood, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of the hall, a walled picture of the United States would hang over the meeting room two floors high.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yöllen, and her colleagues must put the country ' s economic interests ahead of all others.
The Central Bank received a double commission from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This third commission may be an unknown factor in the almost predictable Thursday decision of whether the U.S. economy is ready to avoid the unprecedented incentive provided by the almost zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Even though most of the data show a strong growth in the economy, recent shocks in world financial markets can prevent already cautious Federal System leaders from adding volatility by raising the base rate of federal funds - even at only a quarter of a percentage point.
“It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the rate of uncertainty around the world's market enough to give them a justification to wait," she remarked.
There was no consensus on what the Federal Reserve would do, which in itself caused fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from doing so, with the key indicator showing only an estimated 30 per cent chance of rapid recovery.
This could lead to a decline in the equity market if the federal system raised the rate, provided that decision makers did not mitigate the impact by promising that the next increase would be short-lived.
On Tuesday, the Dow Johns index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was prompted by expectations that the Federal System strategy-makers would leave the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist of the Media's Capital Markets Research group.
"It'll be a surprise if the Federal System raises the stakes at this point in time," he remarked.
If the management of the Federal Reserve System does this, “they will have to go a long way towards adopting their strategy to keep financial markets in hand so that they do not panic”.
Other experts objected that an increase in the rate could have calmed the financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty as to how the Federal System would operate.
Just one month ago, the Federal System seemed to be inclined to raise the rate by 0.25 per cent this month, making the first small pin in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the viability of US reconstruction.
Yale said in the spring and early summer that she was expecting an increase in the rate this year, despite complaints by liberals that greater economic progress was needed.
Although new jobs slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and almost at the level considered full-time by the Federal System.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to fall below the central bank ' s target of 2 per cent, the Federal System ' s management stated that a key factor was the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the decline in the labour market”, observed Ian Sheferdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to collapse at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow-Johns average index for industrial equity fell by 16% relatively high in May, as investors feared that slowing down the Chinese economy could hinder global growth.
The market has partially regained its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the Mayan value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve System, market resentment further complicates the difficult calculation of the rise in interest rate.
“In the absence of information about what has happened in the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, they would have started tying nuts at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior UCLA researcher Ziman Center for Real Estate and former staff member of the Federal Reserve System.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is great uncertainty as to what the impact on the American economy may have on the American economy, and they have little reliable data after recent events in China,” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal System and should not be taken into account technically in these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become the world financial power.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Just a hint from then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could “disgulate” its monetary expansion caused a shock to markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems were increasingly intertwined, it might be expected that the Federal Reserve leaders would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with other banks and experts to understand the world economy better.
Their decision-making process is “faster than science”, said Zachary Carabel, head of Envestnet Inc., a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System there have been cases of excessive reactions to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to economic principles”.
Laker, a member with the right to vote by an influential Federal Open Market Committee that insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998–99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Federal System to lower its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three meetings, “in spite of the limited identified impact on growth in the United States,” said Laker.
A year later, the Federal System leaders cancelled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve System should place stability concerns first only in times of major crises, such as the market collapse in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozin, former member of the Bank of England interest-rate committee.
The last panic and not close to that level, he said.
"You certainly wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of the rising rates because the markets are in shock," said Pozen, President of the Peterson Institute of the World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should take the lead.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown.
The market/convoy was opened in 1997 and belongs to LAX-C Inc.
The often-called Thai Costco, LAX-C, is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Tai Town.
Market/conservation is a store where everything can be bought at once, offering a focal point selection of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchens, furniture, religious and festive ornaments.
There's even a car department if you need to buy fuel for the engine.
It's going to take longer than an hour to search all the rows.
If shopping causes you to starve, buy food from LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cooking department at the store (good and low-cost) is close to the cash register and offers various options for disposal.
What you're saying is, do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably does.
Prices for goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold in bulk.

The Speaker of the Lord's Office, Sergei Narishkin, admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees are streaming into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this view to journalists in Ulaanbaatar at the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of spiritological theories, but the question is of itself: is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic persistence in recent years, have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East?" he asked.
“There must have been someone who thought and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who were fleeing death, were going to the prosperous EU countries,” he added.
Narishkin asked: “Have many European political leaders been frank about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally afflicting their countries?”
"No, old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers silence," he said.
In the view of Narishkin, NATO is in violation of many European values and international law.
“Europe has, unfortunately, long looked and looked at the way in which the NATO military apex has been pushed apart by the moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” stressed the Speaker.
Government forces and their loyal paramilitary forces are opposed by rebels, mainly composed of Islamists.
Later, opponents of the Syrian Government were joined by the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in Russia.
The US supports the rebels, who oppose both Assad and IH.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The president of Syria described the cause of the West’s dislike of Russia.
The Western claims for countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
That was the opinion expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, Channel One, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners or sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and put another to his place in favour of the Western countries rather than in the interests of his homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turnout of Western media with the beginning of a coup in Ukraine.
He said that for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power in an undemocratic manner despite his being elected as a result of democratic elections in the West”.
Putin called upon the world community to join forces with Assad in the fight against the “Islamic State”.
Commenting on the continued statements by the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he left at the request of the people rather than at the decision of the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president will remain, or else he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad named Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation was ongoing with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism in conjunction with neighbouring Iraq.
With regard to the military support of Iran, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, the economy and the military.
He refuted the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
“There is, of course, an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place,” he explained.
For the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Gigil coalition known to the United States,” Assad pointed out.
Over 230,000 people were killed, and 11.5 million refugees were killed.
Part of the territory was occupied by the terrorist group “Islamic State”, banned in Russia.
The International Coalition, led by the United States, strikes the IH position from the air.

Several cars were washed away with their occupants in Washington County.
One of them, the family's van, stopped in a dangerous zone near the water, and suddenly the flow came upon him.
The youngest victim was four years old.
All the dead are residents of the Colorado City and Hildale areas, which were devastated.
Three children were also reported to have been rescued.
There are 650 teams involved in search and rescue work.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Policy: Peace: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary John Kerry made a telephone call with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov.
Reuters refers to the representative of the State Department, John Kirby.
It is noted that the subject of the discussion was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
In doing so, he said that the United States had tools for "the further isolation of Russia" if it supported President Bashar Assad of Syria, and handed over the RIA News.
According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lavrov once again stressed the need to establish a common front against terrorist groups operating in that country during a conversation with Kerry.
Ways of resolving the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Earlier, United States officials had stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and had expressed concern at the strengthening of Assad's Moscow support.
In Washington, D.C., it was stated that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, President Dimitri Peskov, the spokesman of the Russian Federation, stated that the country would not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of overthrowing the Assad regime.
A terrorist organization, the Islamic State, occupied part of the territory.
The International Coalition, led by the United States, targets IH positions from the air.
Boroday called the U.S. newspaper a slanderous newspaper on Ströck.
The former President of the Government, self-proclaimed by the People ' s Republic of Donetsk, Alexander Borodai, denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said that in a telephone interview with Lenta.ru.
The note in Washington Post is beautiful because it's clean-up.
Igor Strekova, former Minister of Defence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, certainly did not connect and “went out” him in a very elevated mood, without ropes, without three furries of money attributed to him by different characters,” he noted.
According to Boroday, the subject was “Strelkov’s conversation with an American newspaper reporter. ”
“Yes, I said that Strelkov was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic,” said the former head of Government of the NAM.
Boroday stressed that he did not know why a correspondent in the United States newspaper had decided to write that the Arrowkov had been taken to Russia “bounded”.
I suspect it's provocative.
If this is not a provocation, it's an oddly misreadable word, because I've stressed that the Arrow has gone by itself," Borodai noted.
"It's a slander on me and on Strellkov," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post, an article appeared stating Boroday’s words that he had forcibly taken Streck to Russia.
According to the publication, Boroday noted that he was forced to bind his companion.
The Polish authorities began looking for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish forests have started cutting down trees over an underground tunnel where, according to some, a third Reich gold train is located.
The work began on Tuesday, 15 September, at Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary to verify the credibility of the rumours of the treasured railway.
Weapons and valuable minerals may be located inside the train.
On 31 August, the governor of the Polish Low-Police voivodship (Tomaz Smolarz) suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a gold train was not more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to chain the search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Peter Joukhowski, had stated that the local graveyardrs “exceeded to be 99 per cent” had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich mentioned in the legends.
Joukhowski noted that if assumptions were confirmed and jewels were discovered, they would be the property of the State treasury, without the treasure being transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a law firm contacted the authorities of the Polish city of Valbzhih and reported that they had found a train in a sealed tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The main drug specialist in the Russian Federation suggested that tobacco sales should be prohibited to persons under the age of 21.
Russia’s chief drug expert suggested that tobacco sales should be banned until the age of 21.
Eugenius Brun noted that before this age, “any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly harmful”.
That is what he said on live broadcast by Radio Govorit Moscow, commenting on information that Speaker Sowpheda Valentine Matvienko supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
Man matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, and you're physically ready to do so.
He's mentally ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, is only fully matured by the age of 21," said Brune.
In the past, the member of the Public Chamber and the head of the “Tresy Russia” project, sultan Hamzaev, told the Israelis that Matvienko had supported the initiative to raise the age of alcohol sales and had “agreed, together with the Public Chamber, to raise the issue again in the upper House of Parliament”.
According to the activist, a working group will soon be established in the Council of the Federation to draft a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to verify compliance with the Law on Information Protection of Children
A resident of Novosibirsk asked the Regional Prosecutor's Office to examine the Bible in accordance with the federal law on the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development, a statement was read by the correspondent Sib.fem on 16 September.
The complainant stated that on 26 August 2015, he purchased a Bible from the 2013 Russian Bible Society at the China City store in the Red Perspective.
In the text of the book, he found fragments which, in his view, violated the FZ “On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development”.
On 16 September, the application was accepted by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Novosibirsk.
Novosibirsk's address will be answered within 30 days.
It's not really about banning a book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself,” commented the complainant to Cib.phm.
Moreover, it is a fundamental problem that will set the stage for society.
He will begin to read the Bible, something he had not done before.
The Brazilian Union of Pediatrics, Rio Grande, promotes healthy feeding for breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS has developed a scandalous method by which to convince women of the need for adequate nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves showing images of babies passing through the breast, written by images of harmful food.
The breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which the children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs of pregnant women and women who give birth, it is recommended that the daily calorie rate be increased by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that the increase in calories alone is not the only change in diet that mothers must make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor of health at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition for pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child ' s immune system has been identified.
Under Hamburg, a school bus was hit by a train.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the railway.
A 23-year-old driving woman, realizing that she could not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And the minute after that, they had a collision in their eyes.
He was filmed by a high school student.
The emergency created panic among the students.
Some children started to cry and run along the shoulder.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously injured except one passenger on a train who was slightly injured.
The damage to the accident was estimated at Euro300,000.
Doctors call for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) leadership has called for the prohibition of boxing in the country after the death of David Brown Jr., a local athlete.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in conjunction with a Filipino named Carlo Magali.
The battle for one of the regional titles of the International boxing Federation (IBF) in the weighing category up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with the victory of Magali through the 12th round.
Brown was in a hospital with a brain and brain trauma.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to life support equipment.
At the professional ring of Brown, he won 22 wins, he suffered only two blows, and one battle ended in a vulture.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second case of a fatal accident among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student named Bradon Smith died of injuries in the ring.
It is now recommended that AMA not engage in this sport but, in her view, ban it altogether.
I understand that this is taking place unintentionally,” said the Vice-President of Stephen Parnis.
But as boxing now exists, there will always be situations in which an athlete is bleeding or brain injury, resulting in either death or serious damage.
For this reason AMA believes that we cannot continue living with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional entity, bringing together doctors and medical students.
Sergey Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the Russian Federation, Sergei Narishkin, declared sanctions against parliamentarians inadmissible.
He made this statement at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as unacceptable action as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And that should not be repeated, because it is an expression of political shame and a disregard for the principles of open international dialogue,” said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the participants of the OSCE PA to re-establish the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's bring morality back to politics.
Let us return to dialogue and law in the practice of international communication.
Let us return humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
"The two never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State urged parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
“Firstly, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiation and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group,” said Narishkin.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
“It's almost the only common ground where there's still discussion on how to normalize the situation in Ukraine,” the politician stressed.
We will recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until 18 September.
Enjoyed winning for a couple or three days.
World champion at Sergey Shubenkov's light athlete.
This season can be described as a triumphal season for a 24-year-old athletic man from Barnaull, Sergei Schoubenkova.
At his crown distance, he managed to win 110 metres of European command lines, to establish a number of records, and, above all, to become the world champion, the first in the history of a national barrier.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final phase of the British League, which ranked third in total.
The New News asked Shubenko to share the impressions of the coming season.
Sergei, isn't the season over for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to play the World War Games that will be held in Korea in October and then I'm going to think about rest.
True, I'm going to be home in Barnaul right now, and being home is still a different condition.
It's easier than praying every week around the world.
You once said autumn was the favorite time of the year for you.
The end of August, early September, is a good time.
The passions after the main start of the season are gone, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
You can compete on "freedom."
Plus, you know, vacation is about to...
Is there any fatigue?
Still special season, a lot of positive emotions...
Weakness always accumulates by the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what else you've been doing - winning or losing.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent flights, relocations, all of these things don't go well for the body.
You're physically and emotionally tired.
But I have emotions right now, of course, on the rise.
I'm just happy!
By the time you're finished at the Beijing Peace Championship, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you journalists don't let me forget about it.
But in general, I think it's bad for the athlete who lives through the old wins to roll his successful races over and over again.
I've enjoyed winning for a couple of days and I've got to move on.
The preparations for this wonderful season were very different from what they used to be?
I can't say that there was something so special.
We started getting ready as early as December, but I missed the winter season.
Trained first in Barnaul's house, then in the meetings, then back home.
It's as usual.
But the trainer was given the task of trying to get to a new level that I hadn't been to yet.
Almost all wintertime was spent laying the foundation.
There were lots of sneakers running around, general training exercises, which included both the train and the siding, and we were rolling our backs.
Then we started the barrier training, and we did a lot of engineering.
Did rivals follow?
I'm always trying to do it, the good in the age of the Internet, there's no problem with it.
I saw a European winter championship, and there all the pedestal was occupied by the French!
I thought I should do something, dilute this company.
With every start in this season, you added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've got all the last season around the same pattern.
There's no way I'm running 13.20 and then 13.50.
I'm always unrolling my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do is run out of 13 seconds.
The focus of all work was on this outcome.
But the paradox is that it seems like it's ready to do something, and it's not always possible to do it in competitions.
What was it like on the London Olympics, for example?
I was, to be honest, that semi-final race (Shubenko could not get into the final. "No.") I tried to forget it right away.
It was pretty good, it could actually run out of 13 seconds.
Even if I were to repeat my best score at that point, I would be the bronze prizer of the Games.
But it's not lucky.
Remember your first world championship?
What about it?
It was in Tagou.
I wanted to get into the finals at the time, and there was a maxim program like this.
And he fell away from the morning, in pre-runs.
Then I realized that to rip and carry a broken head means not to go anywhere.
Two years later, at the Moscow Peace Championship, I was in the finale with a better time.
I can't help but remember how I felt before a decisive race. I wanted to win the gold.
How do you do it when you're developing a good speed, not losing your head, not turning off?
And that's the hardest part.
You have to be very careful, focused on technology, so that you don't break down the barriers.
I noticed that when you set your mind on the process rather than the results, it's much easier.
And the best thing is when you have a sense of running away and doing things yourself!
I bet it's worth it.
Many of our athletes are trying to move closer to the capital after the first major successes.
Have you ever thought that way?
Home's still better.
I don't know where I'm going without my coach. Who needs me?
It might be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be content with what I have.
How long have you been together with the Clovis?
Since I was 12 years old, since I went to college.
Well, first I trained with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.
I started off with a spriint, then I started out in the length of the jump, triple.
A child's maze was -- it's when they throw a ball, jump in the length of the place...
When I was 14, I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
Since the first run, I've been able to meet the standards of the second adult.
It's what I'm supposed to do.
No fear of barriers?
I was able to deal with them right away.
But there's always been a lot of work on technology.
There's been a lot of torture over one run!
But this routine doesn't go anywhere.
The technician has to keep going so I can wake me up at night, I'll get up and run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing claims it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually review my races, and here I can't hold back.
But efficiency needs to be further worked on, there's no limit to perfection.
Don't you worry that winning the Olympics a year before the Olympics will be a heavy burden?
As they say, I will try to live up to my expectations.
Once you've chosen this road, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, no other load should be felt.
And I agree with him absolutely.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so sure I'm surprised to be able to respond to an interview in Ukraine.
People are mad, I understand, their bread is not food. Come on, drop the enemy.
And although I didn't have a flag, and the same thing, a million times I said here, and I didn't call anyone directly a bastard, I got another problem.
All my pseudo-friends are out of control in a second.
The press I'm exposed to is so strong that even I, who's made some kind of kid, think that people are white.
Like he was walking and walking, and you were attacked by a crowd and mutated.
But I need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm going to hit an old man, I'm afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, and now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so bite it.
And you can only give passports to bastards like Fred Durst or Monson.
I wish I, the best journalist, were a shameless job.
A week ago in Kiev, Othar Kushanashvi described the Crimean events in sharp terms:
What they did to the Crimea peninsula is a crime.
And that's what we call annexation.
I believe that the reference to the way Khrushchev's drunk tried to sign does not fit in any way into the overall picture of the human dorm.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking his property...
War from the Kremlin is gone, and it will only end there.
I'm pretty sure, like in the summer of 2008, it started with a call by some bastard from the Kremlin Wall.
I have some idea who it might have been...
Cobson doesn't have much to live for.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Will he lose his apartment?
Well, they took off his monument.
Of course, people remembered him as an insult to their small homeland.
And now reconciliation depends only on Vladimir Vladimirović.
Sunrise Seventh leads the rating despite the ninth attempt to highlight the failure of leaders in the Day Show
Carl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to report on the impact of the Liberian Party's announcement of the leader's release was unable to raise the ratings of the Day.
The Ninth's morning show was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull T.A.
The competitor, Sunrise, with leading David Koh and Samantha Armitaj, was stuck in London as part of a week-long international broadcasting series, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The torture seemed to be of little importance to Australian television viewers, with the Sunrise audience accounting for 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities, compared with the audience of Today in 339,000.
That day was slightly higher than its Monday ratings (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but the figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
That day narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, it had 318,000, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap fluctuated between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 on the Day.
It's the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
Winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the clarification!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015.
An important news item for the Seventh was the amazing 800 Words debut with the former Star Packed to the Rafters by Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a newly widowed family father who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics have wondered if Thomson can handle a popular show alone without the Rafters of Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a loud answer yes.
The X Factor Seventh remained in strong positions with an audience of 1,136 million, easily bypassing the Block (838 000) and TBL Familiations (726,000).
The Seventh was mixed by luck and failure on Chase Australia's second night.
The first half hour (from 5 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.) of the new television set, led by Andrew O'Keefi, gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) of the figure jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough to win a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuyer (613 000).
The first half hour of Chase Australia collected 520,000 viewers on Monday evening and the second half hour a suppressing 720,000.
Hot Seat has collected 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia ratings on the second night will cause the Ninth to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30 p.m.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, who failed to win the McGuyer show.

Three finalists are unanimous in saying that Sam Wood's a perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Can the secret be revealed?
Lana Jewon-Feloughs, Sarah McCay and Snowyan Marcoski may have accidentally made it clear which one of them would win in the Holocaust.
The woman who will eventually be left with Sam Wood in the Holocaust is surrounded by a secret curtain.
And the three girls who reached the end of the race, of course, keep silent about which one of them was the one who got it last.
But when we met Sarah MacKay, Snowy Marcos and Lana Jewons-Felles the day before the three girls were supposed to have two left, they may have given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood maintains silence until the final, on Thursday.
All three women are in a lyric mood, telling them why Wood is the perfect man, while referring to his sense of humor, dedication, family values, joy as reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But with their answers to the question, "If not you, who should get the last of Wood?"
Jvonnes-Feloughs and Marcoski no doubt called MacKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship since the first day.
"From the moment I was part of the show, I felt Sam's energy and his energy, and I realized that they were very good at each other, and throughout the entire show I had no doubt about it," said Jevonne-Felles.
"Sarah's a very open man, easy and fun with her," said Marcoski.
I saw them together, there's really a attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McCay thinks she and Sam Wood will make a great couple.
MacKay himself said that thanks to her home visits last week, she realized that Wood might be "that's the man."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized it wasn't just a game -- I believed him with all my heart," she said.
To the question who should choose Wood, if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same, and Snowyna and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor shows on Wednesdays 19.30 on Ten.

Jarrid Hayne had several options for starting his career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul, and it seemed to be a wise solution.
Some of the coaches would leave Hein on the bench of spares on the rest of the game for the loss of the ball that a former Australian League player, rugby, admitted on his first return to a winning match with Minnesota with 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hein another chance to get back the patient, and also got him involved in the game after Reggie Bush's trauma.
Tomsula showed up on the good side and after the game, in the lockerhouse.
Instead of bringing news to newcomers in front of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hein at a post-memorial press conference.
A special reporter at 49ers Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from the coordinator of the special teams of Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget the lost ball and to think of the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball on the rendezvous by the Minnesota Weikings team during the first quarter
The debut in NHL Hayn and its numerous Australian worshipers clearly did not count on such a start.
You could see Hayne fighting out of the field after losing a ball, and then he told the leading show, "Hamish and Andy" at Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, that he couldn't have imagined a more unsuccessful start for his career in the NFL.
"That happens, you're just thinking about the next game and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared his debut to the 2007 Origin series when a ball drop in his credit zone brought an attempt by Queensland.
The experience was ultimately very useful for a 27-year-old player.
He took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and put it in Instagram.
Elton John and President Vladimir Putin of Russia will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Hodorkowski, the richest person in Russia, was arrested under threat of use of weapons at anthrax airport in Siberia.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkowski was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts to promote democracy stopped.
At the Hungarian border, there were clashes between migrants and the police.
Refugees protested on the borders of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Resque, which grew into clashes with law enforcement personnel.
As a result, Hungarian police used water and tear gas, and transmitted Reuters.
Migrants stone the police and try to remove the fence on the border.
Support has been sent to the scene of clashes, and police officers are responding to acts of aggression by migrants and their attempts to violate the border.
According to Science France-Press, refugees were able to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading for Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports BBC.
The authorities allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and transport them from there to the country they needed.
According to Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of State borders, the prosecution of those who illegally cross the border and the accelerated procedure for handling asylum requests.
The Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegal crossing the Hungarian-Serb border and will therefore be deported and unable to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider shortly the transfer of responsibilities for the protection of the country ' s border to the Hungarian Armed Forces.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began the construction of a barrier with a barbed wire length of 175 kilometres along the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian confessed to having committed the largest cyberattack in the United States.
The Russian accused of the largest cyberattack in the United States, Vladimir Drinkman, admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial in the Federal Court of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, a Russian spoke of a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyberattacks for 15 companies.
The total damage caused by the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Responsors like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. prosecutor Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is threatened with 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a fine of millions of dollars.
When sentencing, the court will take into account the confession of the Russian and may reduce the time limit.
The Drenkman sentence will be delivered on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smith, was taken into custody.
The last of his guilt for the crimes against him denies.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with the support of Russia's Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone call with the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrew US Secretary John Kerry warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict and undermining our common objective of combating extremism unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition,” states a report published on the US State Department's website.
Kerry confirmed the US's commitment to fighting the Islamic State (for which Russian activities are prohibited by the Supreme Court) within a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad “will never be able to be a reliable member of the coalition. ”
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russian isolation was threatened because of support for the Assad regime.
On the eve of the White House, Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation unless the White House's secretary stopped supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed joining the international coalition that was carrying out an anti-terrorism operation against the “Islamic State”.
In recent times, the media have often reported the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, claimed that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and were helping Syrians to learn technology to use it against Islamists.
Four died when the police opened fire with rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police fired rubber bullets in a crowd protesting the country ' s proposed new constitution, as stated by the official on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandei district, some 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.
Bishenu Prasad Dakal, head of the district police force, reported that over 1,000 protesters had gathered at one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police had used tear gas and had then fired in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to be deadly, have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, have led to such high mortality rates.
The confrontation was the last in a few weeks of violent protests in southern, plain Nepal, where the Madezi people claim that the new provinces under the new Constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among the tara citizens who wish to have a State.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes starting with 10
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution had been under way since 2008, but legislators had accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that had claimed thousands of lives in April.
The legislators voted in favour of articles of the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials announced that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk is planning to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk.
It was built in the 1970s as a centre of the chemical industry and has developed infrastructure that requires systematic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was led by a new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
The results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects, he told the correspondent of the Region.
Oleg Valeryewicz, where did you get to work as mayor?
First of all, I have seen the results of the financial and management audits, and I have initiated an independent audit review of the local budget expenditure.
An audit of municipal property was then conducted.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce document processing to five days.
Previously, the papers could go on for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the income base and optimize expenditures.
A Government retreat was held in Saiansk last November to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
The city had no design and cost records (SPAs) for any site.
Without it, Sayansk was unable to participate in federal programmes.
We started by preparing POJD for roads, kindergarten, northern sewer and water.
Road work on two sections is already under way.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
There has been no such positive demographics in the city for the last 27 years.
So, the issue of providing places in kindergartens for today is one of the most urgent.
As of 1 September, kindergarten No. 10 was closed for major repairs for 320 places.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million roubles.
So far, the city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, kindergarten No. 23, which is now attended by 200 children, opened.
The repairs were co-financing from the regional and local budgets, valued at more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the Regional Government, funds have been found for the purchase of furniture and equipment and the People's Initiative Programme has also helped.
Plans are being made to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the priorities of children between the ages of one and a half and three.
We don't have fours for three to seven-year-olds.
Investors are interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city must be carried out, first and foremost by the Saian enterprises, and that they must be provided with work.
As early as October, a 60-family orphanage for orphans in the Leningradska microarean area is in operation.
With regard to construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangara, which has been part of an economy-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin shortly.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing wishing to participate in the programme.
One condition is that housing should not be more than 30,000 roubles per square metre, which includes a subkey.
If we manage the assigned amounts, we will continue to participate in the programme.
In the case of investors, we have other interesting projects.
At the time, the Saiana Porcelain was being built and sold for a price-free price in 2004.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to challenge this transaction.
This is especially so since the land under targets is in federal ownership.
Work is under way with Moscow and the transfer of 88 ha to regional property is being decided, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest in the reconstruction and launching of the 1.5 billion roubles project.
We'll have 900 jobs with a pig pack, which will be a great help to the city.
The Institute of Social Partnership has been developed in Siansk?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
A number of projects have been implemented with the active social position of business representatives.
Enterprises such as the East Centre, the New Zealand TEC, the Sayan Broiler and the MDFC are very supportive, and the management of these enterprises is responding to all requests.
Right by Day of the City of SCO, Sayan Broiler gave the city a children's town, and East Centre renovated the condo, where specialists dealt with the children's therapy, spending more than 1 million roubles.
Sponsoring funds have helped to improve the area of the city registry.
The sponsors helped to paint the City Day.
As in the good old days, there was a parade involving urban groups and organizations.
A history of the city, a book of Sikh poets, was published.
The first - century planners and the people who have made a major contribution to the development of Sa’ansk have been given the anniversary medals.
Mescenatos also participate in a city charity fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 roubles are designed to support talented boys, to help children in need of costly treatment, and to support children from poor families.
How are human resources issues in the social sphere addressed in Sansansk?
The city lacks doctors and teachers of subject matter.
The provision of housing for professionals is essential to addressing the staffing issue.
Over the past year, we've allocated five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have been given office accommodations.
We have a housing programme that can be privatized in five years.
Plans are to replan a building in which eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the programme “House for the Russian family”.
In the future, construction of a house for workers in the fiscal sector.
Most importantly, there's a working team in town with which I can deal with the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential for Sayansk and our region is great.
The draft law on the indexing of social pensions has been introduced in the Duma, taking into account the increase in prices.
The State has introduced a bill to index social pensions every year since 1 February, taking into account price increases.
The author of the document, Alexander Lomakin-Rumyans, Deputy of the “Just Russia”, also proposes to carry out an additional indexing of pensions on 1 April if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of increase in the prices of goods and services.
The indexation of social pensions under current legislation is carried out every year with effect from 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth of the pensioner ' s subsistence minimum in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law introduced to the lower chamber provides for the introduction of social pensions indexing taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
The first indexation is carried out on 1 February and the second on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA stated to Mogerini that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In an official letter to the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federique Mogerini, the Speaker of the OSCE PA, Ilkka Kanerva, declared that sanctions against legislators participating in the Assembly's activities were inadmissible.
This was reported by a member of the Russian delegation to the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar Nicolai Kovalev.
The signatures of European parliamentarians, including the representatives of Cyprus, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, were collected in support of Canerva's position.
"There has already been a strong enough support," said Kovallev.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had expressed his intention to collect signatures of deputies that had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In particular, Kovalev noted that Kanerva promised to raise the issue to the level of European Union leadership and “to send a petition”.
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Cape is 60 per cent
The broad front of the low pressure region of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape Islands is likely to be 60 per cent of the tropical cyclone conversion within the next 48 hours, reported the U.S. National Hurricane Centre on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure area, about midway between the Green Cape and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 per cent probability of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reporting synoptics from Miami.
Google is launching a double donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOGL.O) announced the launching of a double donation campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations that are helping European refugees who are fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used an unclassified personal approach by annoying a fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement by one of the leaders, Google staff member Rita Masud, who had fled from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We went on questionable trains and buses, and suffered hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
Donations will be made to four non-profit organizations involved in refugee and migrant assistance: “Medicians without Borders”, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe has faced the greatest refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has caused the displacement of more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.

Antibiotics with low obesity can be aided by obesity surgery
The beneficial effect, after surgery, may last for at least five years for people with low obesity who have diabetes type 2, according to a new study.
It is, however, too early to claim that low - obesity diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgery treatment.
“ Mortality statistics don't come immediately,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, writing about a new study in the column of JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and the ability of organizations to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in treating diabetes of type 2, but major studies have been carried out among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (IMT) 35 or more.
BMI, weight measure relative to growth, is considered normal at 18.5 to 24.9.
BMI 25 or higher suggests that a person is overweight and that people with BMIs above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwan Hospital Min-Sheng General have used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and manual gastriectomy - with diabetes treatment of type 2 people with low obesity.
The average of those who were subjected to surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, those who receive non-surgery treatment for diabetes remain at about 29.
Of those who had undergone surgery, 36 per cent had been completely cured of diabetes, and 28 per cent had been partially cured.
In the group receiving medication treatment, for comparison, only 1 per cent of diabetes treatment was complete, and only about 2 per cent of it was partially treated.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the “bad” LPSP cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors claim.
Researchers also monitored blood hemoglobin A1s levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, and researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at approximately 8 per cent.
But the best glycemic indicators, reflected in the good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to the research director Dr. Chi-Cheng Soo and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group that had had manual gastroctomy, the bypass group had lost more weight (18.7 kg compared to 14.2 kg), had achieved a greater decrease in the IMT (74 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent to 2.1 per cent), and was closer to the complete diabetes remission (46.9 per cent to 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not show the benefits of surgery in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment does indeed increase life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Fines, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who chose bariatric intervention, the risk of dying for 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encouraged people under 35 interested in such a procedure with CMI.
“The report is very important because it claims that such surgical intervention is safe in a group of low ITIs where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient's I.I.I.T. falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take it seriously," she said.
I think once they accumulate the genetic changes that lead to obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to reverse that.
In the Mishya, robbers took out of the house shuba and 9 million rubles.
In the customs, robbers attacked and stole 9 million rubles and three women's coats.
Interfax informs on this with reference to the Ministry of Internal Affairs press service.
The incident took place Tuesday morning.
Two unknown men entered a house on Gorki Street through an open front door, tied up a 20-year-old son of a housewife, and threatened both with a knife and abducted 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9 million,265,000 roubles, and criminal proceedings were initiated under the heading “Severe”.
European fans are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to obtain a permit.
In the view of the experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to world domination, the authorities will urgently have to think about how to settle all the visitors in the city.
“Rosebolt” interlocutors believe that because of the tournament, the rent of flats will increase by 10-30 per cent, and after the championship, the rent will have to be overpaid.
The world football championship forced the authorities to draw attention to the status of Russian hotels.
According to the law specifically written under the title, every hotel in Petersburg has to undergo a classification procedure and prove that it is consistent with the stated number of stars and the level of service.
It is now clear that not everyone can do so: the farmers are so afraid of checking that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Petersburg.
According to UFAS chapter Wadim Vladimirov, the agency has examined 138 hotels and is now planning 34 hotel cases, many of which simply did not respond to anti-monopoly users.
There are indications that the management of three dozen companies has deceived citizens by placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimov noted.
The problem is, it's literally every number right now, and no one can be lost by 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, the fans will take over all the Petersburg hotels.
Currently, tourists can count on 30,000 rooms in the city.
According to Smolova, in Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two-and-three-star hotels, and 550 single-star hotels.
According to the First Deputy Tourism Development Committee, Nana Gwica, only 23 hotels have so far been classified - so many of the companies accredited in Petersburg.
Whether a hotel has been ordered by regional enterprises to do such a thing is unknown.
I mean, there may be more of them, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months, the hotel has not been very eager to be classified," admitted the director of the Russian Union North-West Department, Ekaterin Shadska industry tour.
This is due to the high season during which farmers earn most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is that budgets that do not include verification costs can cost the hotel between 30 and 100,000 roubles and more.
Recently, however, hotel managers have intensified and applied for classification, and Shadska has been assured.
Hotels have to wait until 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but will not be allowed to work in the peace championship.
It is already known that, depending on the starryness, a fixed hotel room fee will be established at the time of the tournament.
The formulas for which the value will be calculated will be announced next year.
This is done to prevent prices from rising by 200 to 300 per cent, as is the case during, for example, the Petersburg Economic Forum.
We need to have a conscience and keep the hotels from rising by two to three times, but we need to let the hotels make a living.
"I think it's going to be up to 50%," explained the President of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not convinced that price fixing is consistent with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this is within the scope of economic theory, but I hope it's justified.
"It's better to travel without restraint," he said.
It's not clear what's going to happen to popular cheap hostels.
Statelors have introduced a bill to prohibit hostels in their homes.
I very much hope that this law will not be passed or will not apply to Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels must be preserved," Nan Gwachia believes.
However, she said that mini-housing owners must in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State party did approve the bill, about 80 per cent of the hostels would be closed in Petersburg, and currently there were 1,500.
According to Leonid Garbar, President of the Federation of Rectors and Hotels in the North-West, there are two-and-three-star hotels in Petersburg, which are precisely used by football fans, but which is a distortion towards hotels with four and five stars.
This is similar to the situation in which “the 80 thousand stadium is occupied by 75,000 raps”.
It can be fixed at the very least.
Their possible prohibition is "idiotic": "I think it's weird that some people can live in apartments, but they can't come for some reason."
If the hostel is used as a dorm, I agree it's wrong.
But if, as a hotel where visitors arrive for a short period of time, why not?
The mini-hospitals risk missing the world football championship and because of their slow pace.
Hundreds of small hotels simply cannot get to the classification level, and it can be self - centered.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be booked.
“The companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will give up less paid orders from the mini-hots, but will choose those that travel,” noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, verifications have been made so far well above the Petersburgs.
The reason for the delay in Petersburg is, among other things, the constant displacement of the Government ' s tourist bloc, which does not contribute to the smooth work.
Experts are of the view that if the Petersburg hotels are not enough, it is likely that regional hotels and rest houses will have to be brought to the attention of all.
Like the 300th anniversary of Petersburg, the river fleet can be mobilized into the city, i.e. visitors to the tournament can live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will be trained to travel by vans where they can spend the night.
"It's not good to set up so many hotels that they're empty," Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Renewed housing will also be very popular during football pioneering.
It is likely that the city will have a reserve of fixed apartments.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"It's obvious that the first place to leave is near the stadium," noted Larissa Bragin, a rental specialist for the Agency for Development and Research in Real Estate.
However, the rent price may not return to its original level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of a new transport gap on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Remember, too, the human qualities of citizens.
Leonid Garbar, for example, is convinced that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, where people not only point the way, but they can also do mini-extraction.
There are also complications.
My dad met a family from Murmansk in 1970 -- father, mother, and two children.
They found it hard to spend the night with hotels, and it was hard to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," recalled the interviewer.
True, he added that there's no such thing in the city right now - calling his own home has consequences and is scary.
But perhaps in 2018, after the bad decisions of the Lords, the mistakes of the hotels and the governments will have to be remembered.
The Zyrinin "sil" of the Amur Region.
I was thrilled to see Girinski's clown in Gosduma today.
He did things like this when our generation has only learned to trade newspapers, and he is still in beautiful shape.
The theme of the statement was, as it were, “LDP's protest against the results of the Amur elections”.
The protocols do not shake - for nothing; there seems to be no other protocol but those signed by the samplers.
So he takes up Ivan Abrahamov's second seat and shouts something like, "This is the winner of the election!"
At the same time, nothing comes against Rodinin, and then, after an argument with the chairman, removes the faction from the conference room by literally saying, “You are all with your fronts and your thieves”.
Of course, the press does not focus on Abraham, but rather on the scandal and démarche of the faction as a result of the scandal and insult.
Wolfović actually did the Amur region with Abrahamov, beautifully and elegantly.
For the whole country, this is a regular Girinski's "Podorka" show, not a political party's protest against the results of specific elections.
And the faction formally scandalized, and the elections, if you believe the party's website and Facebook, Ivan Abrahamova, are not recognized, but the leader is clearly getting down on the subject.
Leaves the dead on Amur to bury their dead, and he himself preachs against the One Russia in general and in nothing at all.
It's an excellent decision not to lose a face, and not a real one, but a showy scandal.
The other thing is that now Abraham himself is in a strange position.
He didn't wait to hear anything from his superiors, but there's no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, for the narrow circle, he has become a formal occasion to insult a respected championship, and, more coolly, the fall of Ham towards the EP and the FON.
And here, of course, he needs to think seriously about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the politics number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 of the single regional single-mandate district, it can become a couple who have been successful in using their own party leadership and super-enragment for the same FNL and the party leadership of the stranger.
Of course it wouldn't have been Girinowski who should have invented it and watched it with respect.
The tram is still growing and growing before it.
It was reported that LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary.
I mean, the jar fell from nothing at all.
The only thing is the subject of Abraham underneath the grave.
It's beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" -- Dalai Lama -- RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to the violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama referred to the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre in Oxford on ethics studies at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, under the current circumstances, the interests of humankind should be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while that was exciting, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama spoke highly of the actions taken by Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“The concern for thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you must think about durable solutions, how to bring real peace and genuine development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
After all, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to the violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, stating that the US had launched a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a non-violence solution was possible.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have swallowed a disinfectant in their hands over the past 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States have reported an increase of almost 400 per cent since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed a high alcohol-containing disinfectant, reports Georgia State Toxicology Centre.
According to Dr. Heylord López, director of Georgia’s toxicology centre, the cases of children swallowing hand-decontamination fluids reported in the toxicology centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are more likely to contact these substances and, unfortunately, some percentage are sent to the emergency room”, said López CNN.
He said that some children drank disinfectant specifically, and some did so to impress their friends or to dispute for social networks.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquids as cheap drinks.
Adolescents were said to mix disinfectant liquid with alcohol - containing mouth - breaking fluid to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to pleasant smells of disinfectant.
"The child doesn't think it's going to hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand-decontamination fluids) are aromatic.
There are disinfectant hand fluids with the smell of strawberry, grapes, and oranges that are very attractive to children.
Hand-decontamination fluid contains somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.
Small children, especially children, may have only a few sprays that can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is high concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City by Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief of the toxicology centre at the University of Kansas hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a whisky bar just like that, but people keep in mind these disinfectants for their hands, and if kids get there, that's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently swallowed a disinfectant in school with a strawberry scent of about four sprays, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her level of alcohol in her blood was 179, twice that of an adult who is legally considered to be in an alcoholic state, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett health centre near Atlanta.
Naija confused her words and was unable to walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
The doctors watched her spend the whole night in a separate child clinic to keep her from missing any signs of brain trauma, since alcohol had caused her to fall and hit her head, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," told CNN Orthoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
This could have been fatal to my child.
López recommended that parents and teachers use non-conspiratory substances or disinfecting napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant fluids for the hands of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are linked to death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, and not ethanol, which was listed as active.
In January, three four-year-olds in the north of New York agreed to poison their “contrary” teacher by “disseminating antibacterial substances in the classroom” according to a police report.
The teacher had a strong allergy for hand disinfectants, and she said she wouldn't keep them in her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was “empty talk” and addresses discipline to the school district.
Like the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the N.K. K. K. K. Krupsk Children's Library, a quagmire owl is sad.
Young people who come for books try to feed them with candy.
For several generations now, the library has been in the library for 95 years.
The earliest readers in the 20th century had read loud readings, dramas on Mayakovsky’s poems, literary Victorias, and correspondences with Lenin’s wife.
The census went on for four years, and as The Young Bernie wrote in 1939, “the friendship between the Hope of Constantine’s Creup and the friends of the Children’s Library of Barnaula became stronger and stronger each day.
The hope of Constantine even sent a picture of her child to distant barnaul friends.
And when the barnalys were asked if their hope of Constantine was opposed to the library being given her name, they wrote that they did not.
Letters have long been in the museum, and the grandchildren and great - grandchildren of the early readers have had to explain whose harsh profile makes a relief on the library building.
During the years of adjustment, people often called, resented: Why is the children’s library not renamed?
Let's have a library of the name of some good child writer, without political colouring!
The staff of the library sat down, thought about it, and decided to leave it as it was.
The Creek is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, like the Leninka in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow brick pathway.
"The Wizard of the Fossil City" is the favorite subject of the artist Oli Moscowki.
In the past, Ola was the manager of a legal company, came to work at eight, left at five, and all the other managers were different only from the love of painting.
And then I found an ad on the Internet saying, "We need an illustration for a book."
A little American girl wrote a book called "My Cancer Momy" -- "My mom's cancer."
Ola made illustrations, and thought that life could end at any moment, and there would be no miracles in it if you didn't create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates the children's books of writers around the world and creates fairy tales.
Traditionally, children are thought to lose interest in the book, to live more and more in some virtual space...
But we have children reading, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, and says "Russia Planet" to the director of Tatian Kuszvid Library.
In recent years, we've even had a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and she's going to live -- the kids are coming here!
I think interest in reading is coming back.
The Library Lobby has a large exhibition with an up-to-date photocast.
Once a quarter - long display is made of new photographs of readers who go to the library for the whole family: mother, father, and children.
The library is happy to see that Dads are coming with the children more and more.
If the child was read all over Chukowski at the age of two, he would need more complicated books.
But there is now a law that prohibits an eight-year-old tundkindu from issuing books from category 12+.
To get such a book, a child has to bring his parents with him -- they come back, then they come back again, and gradually, "Kurska" becomes something for them like a family club.
There's a treasure in the library, a pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and eras, to guide King King in an annex to the magazine "Niva", and Mourzilka's cover for 1936.
Because we're not just the conceptual space of the "book temple" right now, we're open to movement, we're trying to be a special place: not home, not work, not school, explains Tatyana Kuszvid.
We can come together to read, play, draw.
We've made a play area for the kids - a kid just comes to play, and he still reaches out to the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they resist with their feet, and they do not want to leave.
Moms with wheelchairs often come in, and we're happy that they put the library first among all the other places they want to come with the babies.
Tatiana Kuszvid says that today's children, just like we used to do, love classical children's literature:
"The matter of publication is now evolving, and much attention has been paid to the authors, who are the link between generations."
And when it comes to little kids, it's important for them to have some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly issues booklets to parents that tell them what is happening in modern children’s literature, what books are worth looking at, and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to remove books outside the reading room.
This magical privilege is enjoyed only by children.
In the outermost room of the library, there's a square hatch with an ancient wooden ladder in the basement, in the bookstore.
The feet will screech under your steps, it's a very old time machine.
You meet your childhood book like an old friend: hello, good that you and I don't change.
Ellie's still walking up the road with a yellow brick, she's stealing magic matches from Tol Ryskov, and Malcolm-Kibalche has never told the damn bourgeons of the Military Privy that he's got a strong word.
Books like passwords, you can find out where you live.
There are real book rares in the vault - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and eras.
Or lead the King in the famous annex to the magazine Niwa.
Or Murzykka's undercover in 1936.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in tea color.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, and I wish I'd retire and take care of rare children's books.
But the kids won't behave like that, and the paints in old books aren't very bright, and the topics... you open the front page, and there's Lenin, party, commomol.
Now I think, why did we all write out this Pioneer Truth?
But it was still interesting, as Halina Ilásov, head of the bookstore, says "Russk Planet."
Murzyka's pages went dark from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna runs a bookstore for the rest of his life.
She knows the color of Buratino's caps, the school year Harry Potter became the captain of Gryffindor's team at the Quidditch Championship, in which situations Carlson uses the silencer for the motor, and who is Alice's father, Selina.
There is little to pay for the work of a library, and anyone who can live without these books is quick to find another profession.
Only the most convinced ones remain: educators, educators, ministers of the book.
You can also find them by smiling -- it's thought to be a professional feature of a child's library.
If he smiled at you at the first minute of the conversation, that's a professional.
I like children's books at all: how I like them to be on shelves, and I love reading them,' says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical, fairy tale, fiction.
I'm reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different from my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And since I was madly fond of them, it seemed to me that the library was a magic place.
And I wanted to work where everybody is sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be in spite of the lairs.
And I'm happy when our former readers bring in children or grandchildren...
Hearing mill: The Celtica has no disagreements.
Griffiths denied the discussion about the dispute in Celtica after Dale admitted that Hups was in a bad position, but he's gonna fix it.
Harts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt the unity of the team
“Dons” increased the advantage over “Seltic” to five points.
The Penalty Adam Runey in the first time gave Aberdeen a small advantage over the Hamilton in Pittodr, which allowed Dons to fall off Celtika for five points.
Griffiths rebutted discussion of differences
This caused rumours of disagreements in the Celtica, which were suppressed by Griffiths, who claimed that he and his teammates suffered no increased criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the tension, I don't think the players want it.
Dutch people are bored because Scots are not in the title fight - where Bur
Former Rangers paralegal and former Dutch congregator Ronald de Bur stated that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Selika because he was not competing for a title with Rangers.
Where Bure, now Ajax's representative, said, "The Dutch no longer show the most attractive moments of Celtika's game, but why?"
It's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about coming back to Rangers.
They're talking about the Old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of stress in Old firm games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I will change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
The defeat from Malmö and, as a result, the withdrawal from the League of Champions was soon followed by the losing of 10 Aberdeen football players, who now fall into the top of the table with five points.
But Dale said, "The Celt had bad times before, and we'll go out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I realize it's very sad, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And neither do we, but we need to keep going.
And we really do need the support of Selika because it makes the players so much better.
Staying together right now is so important.
Warberton Untrustfully awaits January’s transfers
Despite views that appeared just a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had defined some of the objectives of January's transfers, the Rangers' boss, Mark Warberton, was suspicious of the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the team's unity.
The former attacker, Brandford, said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in summer, you have a period before the season to adapt them, which you saw in our own group in that season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in Celtik, hinted at the end of his career.
The attacker, Swansi, Mitch, linked to Celtic during the transmission window, suggested that he could leave the football after his contract with the Cygnus was over.
A 29-year-old player suffered from a ankle problem for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Harts is going to resist SFA on Nelson's statements.
Harts was in charge of 2:1 when Patterson was removed, and was played by 3:2, but the defence card was later cancelled; this is Collum's third red card, cancelled in eight months.
Well, Nelson doesn't give up on his words, saying, "I didn't question the ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tinxal
The stubborn Habernian player was ridiculed after he admitted that he was singing a song with offensive words about former Harts player Rudy Skel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh Derby in Tinkasla in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was burning," said the attacker, adding, "I can't say with certainty that I wasn't going to go back to Tinaksla, if he didn't play Celtic."
Donnelly: Tannadis's advice is confident of the management of "Dandy United."
Simon Donnelly claims that the board of directors of Dundy United continues to be confident that the team of managers will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys out again," said Donnelly.
McInness is glad that "not good" won for Hamilton.
Derek McInness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assisi to win the seventh consecutive victory in the League, which placed them five points higher than Celtica, at the top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runy's first-time bar.
McInness said, "There's not a team here who win a cup or a league champion who didn't win a meeting like this."
The unemployment rate among Scottishs does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is increasing
IN Scotland, the unemployment rate remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher than the rate for the United Kingdom by 5.5 per cent, as shown by figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland has dropped by 12,000 in three months, with the number of workers currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland has dropped to 74.0 per cent per quarter, higher than the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Minister of Affairs, David Mandela, commenting on the latest figures, noted: “The Government's long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy”.
Almost a year has passed since Scotland decided historically to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in Scotland ' s labour market, with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why am I a witness to the execution of Oklahoma
Today, while avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will watch man executed.
If that happens, and I hope I don't, I'll be sitting on the death row watch gallery at Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glosip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
This was first made in January, through a close friend of his, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I became afraid.
So why would I do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since more often than places are available, the results of the dark lottery determine who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats has been reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'm going to sit with Richard Glassy's closest friends, and he and I had our own relationship after months of telephone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk to him.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so they won't let me take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'm gonna have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of being impartial on Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She acknowledged that she herself “could have formulated better” but still felt that I was wrong in what I was doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he told me.
I told him he could get me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that transparency will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I wrote down.
I'm not going to go into detail here again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossip isn't to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Trezé make him guilty of aiding a crime.
But I believe there's a high probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the death penalty evidence was insufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll watch him die.
I can't claim I'll be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted.
I'm going to tell you what it's like to watch someone I like die needlessly.
A man pursued by the police was persuaded to climb out of the Kanning River
Constable from Canning-Wale managed to persuade a man to get out of the Kanning River and to stay dry.
A resident of Perth intended to withdraw from the police but failed to get stuck in dirty water in shallow water a few metres from a police officer who was trying to “slow him to the shore”.
The Kanning-Weila police were summoned on Tuesday to enter another territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself into Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I won't go out, come on, grab me,' said Senior Sergeant Chandall Castledane.
Constable Laklan Perhavetsa didn't really want to wet the uniform, so he used a safer way of doing it - "negotiation with a good cop."
"Somewhere people do weird things to try to escape," says Senior Sergeant Castledane.
That's what Ben Kazin's football player remembered.
In 2006, Kazins went to a ditch to avoid a meeting with a police patrol to check on alcohol and tried to swim over Swan.
His efforts turned out to be in vain, but they caused the local people to invent the comical Ben Kazins Biothlon.
Peter Moody blames the stewards for trying to spy and threatens to leave the horse sport.
Peter Moody accused the Raking Victoria stewards of trying to introduce the spy into his stable last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
His target was the stewards and ethics officers Raking Victoria, whom he accused of having personally launched a campaign against him, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the launch because of the violation of the rules on the use of drugs on the day of launch, on Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to participate in the race, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive effect of the leader's cobalt sample, which he can't explain.
He kept his tongue on suspicions of espionage for a year and a half and didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been putting up with it for a long time, but sometimes it's been so messed up that you can't stop it," Moody said.
They know it continued.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head up, and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they think it's wrong, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody used to make a sensational statement during an interview at racing.com that the Ethics Division was trying to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart sat in the room with a person I'll call if they ask me, and offered him a job in my stable to convey information about what I'm doing in my stable," said Moody on Raking.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all of us make an application, since they failed to catch me.
Robert Rollstone, former RVL president, David Moody, current RVL president, and Bernard Sondri, external RVL executive director, knew about this all the time and they know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL take courage and hold accountable for what's going on in this business, other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it's true.
Maybe they should take my license away and push me away, and I'm sure what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I've reached the point where I don't care, and it's sad for me.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and hold them accountable for decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration only grew in the course of a long investigation into the Cobalt and Lidari case, and the last removal of the horse from the launch forced him to declare that he could "put his license on the table."
Moody, the best known for having produced the unconquerable Black Caviar championship, described the requirements for the use of medications on the day of the "mixery" competition after the horse was pressed with clay, which was in violation of the rules.
This is breaking the rules on the jumps.
'I must be fully responsible for it,' he said.
One of my employees made a mistake to put pressure on her leg.
She could've gotten a compress last night.
She could've got it yesterday, just like it was.
She was with him the day she ran.
Moody can be disqualified for three months under the regulations on the use of medications on the day of the compress competition, which is why the stewards opened an investigation.
It's an anecdotes.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's too far," said Moody.
A driver who has carried out a raid and who has fled the scene of an incident in Cobram is arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram on a weekend and fled the scene.
The helicopter was taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Murray Welly Hayway this morning.
The police said the driver had left without stopping to help the wounded rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalie surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
It is anticipated that he will be charged with leaving the scene, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic regulations.
A motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Kobram, remains in a stable hospital.
Craig Bellamy, a Melbourne Storm trainer, steams up the charges of rivals using hard force tactics
Craig Bellamy, coach of Melbourne Storm, described the criticism of intercepting the ball as his team's "encouragement of the agenda" on the part of two championships of NRL.
Trent Robinson, a Sydney Rusters trainer, stated that the judges allowed the Strum to “fight” his team during the sudden victory of the Strome in the finals of the Sydney qualification game on Friday evening.
"Brysbane Broncos" coach Wayne Bennett made a clear hint at Storm after his team won the finals of a qualification tournament at Nosern Queensland Cauboise on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for a rugby league and stated that two of the Queensland team were not "very successful" in a hand-to-hand match.
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball by his team and said that they were simply focused on "contacte", intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was convinced by the criticism of his team by two leading coaches, which meant that they were concerned about the possible defeat of the Steer.
"This keeps going--I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about tough receptions when they played us at 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything for a year in our defense systems or equipment, just in the last six weeks, we've given special attention to the contact between the balls, and that's a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years and he's clearly trained a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's kind of a shock for him.
It's funny how it always happens at this time of the year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "smart football" by reminding his teacher that Bennett's St. George-Illavarra Dragons won at the 2010 championship by showing "tastey" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was," Bellamy remarked.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized for calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care about it at all.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young para-protectors at their speed.
It's a football game you'd like to play when you have such players.
He made that observation in 2010, and now he wants everyone playing football in his style -- not every team has two paralegals like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play it.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storma and Rusters games were more points than the Broncos and Cauboise games.
Broncos was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score?
In our game, he was 20.18, there were two other attempts -- and what, that's impressive football?
Or are breaks and failed attempts impressive?
It's routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
Storma's at the end of this week's weekend because they won the right to take over either North Queensland Cauboise or Kronalla Sharks the next Saturday evening at the preliminary finale of AAMI Park, the tickets will be available for sale the next Tuesday morning.
The accused of possession of drugs has been released on bail at $200,000.
A man who was threatened with life imprisonment for attempting to devote 40 kg of cocaine to Queensland was released on bail at $200,000.
Marco Maximović, aged 29, was one of five people arrested last month after the federal police had discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the solay yacht from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Kumer in August.
During the morning, Maximović and his associates were seen on the docks, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse Cafe, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo's car.
Despite the fact that Maksimović is in danger of life for trying to make drugs sufficient to sell, counsel Maximović argues that there is no evidence that the latter was trying to get the whole lot and that the man could have been in a cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximović should have been released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
The mother and her father, Maximović, were asked to provide a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
“It is clear from the testimony of both that the amount of $200,000 is too much for them to bear,” said Judge Flanagan.
But this is not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximović was permitted to be released on bail, provided he would hand over his Australian and Serbian passport to the police daily and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fiotis Cacicaris: "I'm proud of the assembly of Greece that fought until the last seconds."
The chief coach of the prefabricated Greece, Fotis Cacicaris, paid tribute to his team after the match of 1/4 of the Eurobasket (2015) with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was determined by individual errors.
It was a big game, cited by AFP Cacicaris.
We were preparing for a great Spanish game.
They tried to work in defense, but the defense errors determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I will be entrusted with the functions of the Kauna."
A new CCISA guy, Joel Freeland said he didn't believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroliga in the next season.
I've spoken to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, myself, after joining the team, I quote "R-Sport" Friland. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kauna, who left the team both in protective structures and in an attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can handle this.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to adjust to the central position, but I'm playing the forard more in the NBA.
Now I'm gonna have to fight the big central rival, but I've done this before, so I think I can handle it.
The army won the last Euroliga in 2008.
Since then, they've been traveling six times to Final Four, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling that the team is out of line.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course it's hard, I understand all the frustrations of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can do, we have a good chance to win the Eurolig, I really think.
I've always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have won the tournament, and I think this year is going to be the year of the CCCA.
As for the glaze, I'm not a superstitious man and I don't believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you connect these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any ritual before the games, I just listen to music, and I try to relax as much as possible.
Louis Enrique: "For me, the Rome match will be special."
The chief coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the 1st tour of the League of Champions group tournament with Rome with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the exact combination of his present and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
We'll recall that Luis Enrique was training "wires" in the 2011/12 season, but he couldn't show up on the best side in Italy's capital.
I went back to Rome a few years later, for which I have gained some experience.
I have extremely warm memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start a championship in the League.
The August meeting in Joan Hamper's Cup will not affect the action of the teams in the nearest match.
I'm expecting Roma from the game she showed in series A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Krypchenko: "The Krasnodar" has different options for attacking."
The acting chief coach of the “Urala” Vadim Krypchenko in anticipation of the 9th Tour of the Premier League with the “Krasnodar” noted the diversity of the attacker's team's attack schemes.
According to the mentor, "breaths" have several models of attack games in their arsenal.
The team will be held on 21 September and will begin at 16.30 Moscow time.
As we play with "The Beauty," let's see, brings the official website of "The Urala" with the words "Screechenka."
We've got a week of training ahead of us.
This team has different options of attack, multiple attacks, but we're not slow, so I think there's going to be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is playing the League of Europe's match against the Dortmund “Bossia”, we'll be very good at preparing to win.
Roher Kanyas: "Astana's home can take points from anyone."
"Astana" defender Rocher Kanyas expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future after the first tour of the League of Champions Group Tour.
According to Havbek, the Austans can pick glasses from any rival in their fields.
Even though the match was hard for us, I can say we played well, and we've got the official UEFA website for Kanyas' words.
"Benfia" is higher in class, but in a home match, I think we can count on them to pick out the glasses.
It's very real.
But first we have to think about Galatasara, and then we have to think about Atletico.
We can take points from anyone's home matches.
Raphael Benítez: "A second time: Krishtian Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Rafael Benítez, chief coach of Real, expressed satisfaction with the major victory of the first tour of the League of Champions team tournament with Schakhter (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to Forard Krishtian Ronald, who was the author of the three heads.
The match wasn't easy, 'cause Sachter knows how to own a ball, and it brings up the official UEFA website for Benitas.
The rival didn't have a lot of moments, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I'm not saying that Real played perfectly, but we had enough of the space.
I'm glad we didn't miss the balls and got four.
Krishtian Ronaldo confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll say that as many times as I want.
Jordy Alba: "Kristian Ronaldu cannot be compared to Messie."
The Barcelon's defender, Jordy Alba, believes that no one can compare with his friend Lionel Messie.
According to the Spaniard, Krishtian Ronald's Fora Real can't do that either.
The Masses are five heads above the rest of them, quoted Le Figaro Alba.
Even Krishtian Ronald.
I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniel De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only a unique style but also a bright personality.
The "Roma" defender, Daniel De Rossi, on the eve of a team tournament of the League of Champions with Barcelona, noted the importance of compactness and insurance in a game with such a powerful rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, beginning at 21.45 Moscow time.
Remember, "SE" will broadcast it in text.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team with great players, and quotes UEFA de Rossi as an official website.
It is difficult to play with blue-grenats because they have not only a unique style, but also a bright personality.
In order to leave them, we're going to have to bury each other throughout the game and protect each other.
Massi is almost always successful when she's under siege, so we need to remain firm and organized.
Food hopes to get into the U.S.A.A.A.A.S.A.A.A.C.A.C.A.
The Holkipper of Ilya Jerov stressed that he hoped to be able to enter the army's launch site in the next CKL championship match.

The next match will be held in front of Slovene.
I hope I get out in the next match in the initial composition, and it's R-Sport that the words "R-Sport" of Jerov.
I'm not an raffle expert, I'm an raffleman, we don't have a double of the missing heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" played well, everybody has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I'd rather miss a bigger one, but the team won.

Stephen Hogg used the girl's phone to force pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered with the Internet service, where he received a number of lewd images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up and found a missing phone and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked him out and found some shocking photos, and then she immediately brought it to her mother’s attention.
The police came and saw five images, followed by a survey of the computers found at the address, and found “relevant” queries in the search engine using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then said to the police that he did this because it might be "incite pedophiles," and then he would've pretended he was a cop to scare them."
The Commissioner of Justice, Elyd Robertson, told the sheriff's court in Dundee, "He said it was passion, he had a passion to scare people.
He admitted that he had made inquiries on the computer but said that this was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was interviewed about the conversation he had with an unknown person who had sent pictures to him and asked for more photographs.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a head problem when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found pictures on her phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw indecent images on the phone, and the accused was given a face-to-face rate.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused was using a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23 years old, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of making lewd pictures of children on 14 June last year, violating the conditions of bail on 25 January this year and not appearing before a court at the hearing on 24 March this year.
The defendant's counsel, Gregor Sim, requested that Hogg not be listed as having committed sexual offences because it could be proved that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, until he received certificates from the social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was taken into custody prior to hearing other outstanding cases.
It was added to the list of perpetrators of sexual offences even before the date of sentencing.
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is reading the wrong speech in Parliament.
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest government leader, fell down earlier this year from the stairs leading from the podium.
It wasn't hurt, but the scene of the fall was instantly spread over social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by statements by parliamentary opposition that they had received anonymous threats warning them against the development of Mugabe at the time of the address.
A month ago, they learned the President's message to the nation in Parliament; this is exactly what Mugabe said on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonze, a member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, stated that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones to prevent Mugabe from interrupting their speech.
“The communication came from a number which is not displayed, but is entitled ‘Dead,’” he informed journalists at the end of Mugabe’s speech.
The designated members of Parliament were warned that the integrity of the Parliament was being terminated and that as soon as they came out, parliamentary immunity was not in force.
A member of Parliament stated that the party, led by Morgan Tswangirai, was “unsuspected” by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard aims to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its programme of restructuring and reducing service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated job losses would amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, in Hewlett-Packard.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise”, said Mag Whitman, President and Director-General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and the portfolio of business directions will be broader and deeper to help the company move towards a new business style," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are better off than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of over $50 billion and “will focus on providing previously unattainable integrated technological solutions” to companies, as reported in the company's statement.
This is the case of a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard for the production of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto has been called “the birthplace of the Kremlin Valley”.
Hewlett Packard is in the process of extensive reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is a step by HP, the second-largest computer manufacturer in the world, and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, which is the latest development in this sector, based on the confidence that specialized companies are working better.
Captain "Arsenala" Michael Arteta says that his clubmates should support the traumatized Jack Wilshire before playing Dinamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that it was only September, and that if Wilshire's recovery were to proceed according to plan, he would have nothing to do with his return to Christmas.
With the best of events, Wilshire will accurately miss at least four of the next games in England and, given what has happened, his participation in the European championship next summer remains in question.
Most important on this recent issue is Wilshire's confident completion of the previous season with the only injury to his ankle and his intention to return to the conventional aggressive style of playing during pre-segmentary training.
"This trauma doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not the end of the bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not about the ankles or the injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but, as Hungarians also admitted, there is a risk of additional injury for any player returning to the mid-sea game.
There is also a bad trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different injuries in his six years since his debut.
He also played only 65 out of 157 Arsenala games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenala's schedule wider, you can see that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two premier League clubs, which account for the largest number of missing days due to trauma.
The Hungarian recognizes the possibility of being stuck in a vicious circle, but the Arsenal believes that improved injury statistics will continue during the last season.
"Sometime when you're back in business after the trauma, you're vulnerable for some time -- in that time you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure of it, as well as his career being what he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with the Dinamo-Zagreb, and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and the next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Héctor Belérin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Mathieu Debüshi and Arteta will play the start-up.
Perhaps Wenger will also join Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giro instead of Nacho Moral and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little break to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional group F favour, Macximir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most fortunate in Europe.
Dinamo hasn't lost any of the 41 matches since they were able to spend the last season as "Invincible."
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned the lesson learned last season when the team was defeated in the game of the Monaco Champion League and remains with little hope of leading the club to the victory of the Champion Cup in the finale.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger remarked.
Arsenal has never done this before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a senior reality.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of such stories is eye-opened, especially in view of how desperate men's need for honesty is now more than ever, with suicide rates among young men at the maximum level of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the single largest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and it is three times more common for men than it is for women.
In an attempt to address the issue of the Campaign Against Unhappiness, 2015 declared the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a sufficient number of “normal” friends, the chances of treatment double.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends can reduce the risk of mental disorders by half.
But of course, for friendship to work, you have to make it work.
In an age where communication is managed by social networks, where style prefers content, the speed of the response is often more valued than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, loving, and successful, even if there is a reality of loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship - which have a greater impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire recently observed, the game maker, money doesn't actually buy more happiness.
The virtue of Friends is that they're drawing attention to it.
Each character was defined not through his work but, rather, through a person who appeared in association with friends.
Jumor Joey and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments when you're looking at football on comfortable chairs, Ross' breaths on Rachel, everything comes from understanding that men can feel it even though they often refrain from fully examining their feelings.
As Samariten said to me, "my role as a listener to people who are depressed and suicidal is to emphasize how even the smallest association of friends can be beneficial."
Often, those who approach us feel unable to talk to our friends.
The old "live with this" teaching is strong, as is the feeling that frank talk about problems can be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term mechanisms to overcome.
It highlighted the subtle aspects of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of an outsider talking on the phone helps people in times of despair, and long-term support comes from the immediate circle of family and friends.
So, if you're visiting FriendsFest at the Company Central this weekend, where you've completely restored the decorations for the holiday, why don't you take your friends a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see a single person in Starbucks, smile and say, "Hi."
It is early not to guess what benefits friendship can bring.

Dee Maria's killing her goal by helping SGF destroy Malmö.
Angel de Maria, like Blaise Matudi and Edison Kavani, celebrates the scored balls at Malmö's gate.
Ángel de Maria, debuting in the League of Champions, scored a goal than allowed "SG" to easily go around "Malmö" on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel de Maria and Edison Kavani did their job when Parry St. German started his game in the League of Champions with an extremely comfortable victory of 2:0 versus Malmö at Park de Prance Stadium on Tuesday.
Dee Maria hit the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Champions as a player of "SGF" to send to French champions, but they missed out on a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Kavani scored a 61-minute goal.
Along with the Real Madrid and the Donets Schachter in Group A, Parry had to start a good start in the game against Swedish champions, since they were aimed not at qualifying the game-off, but at continuing the series of successful games during the last three seasons, where they reached the quarter of the finals.
They earned points, but it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovich useless in the attack and to replace him later in the field against a team from his hometown and club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win a house or a guest at the Champions League, so to win the 2:0 score, deliver problems to rivals and play a great role in defense is a good start, even if there are other moments that we will need to finish during the season," said Blance.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I'm sorry we didn't hit one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovich returned after being injured by one of the replacements in the Paris team, which brought her no more than 2:2 in a match with Bordo in the First League on the weekend, but he was put into the background by Dee Maria for four minutes.
The Argentine assailant was described as a player capable of bringing the U.S.S. to a new level in Europe after he was bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran to the pasture from Marco Verratty behind the protection of Malmo and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone was expecting an easy and great victory at that time, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who won Celtica at playoff to reach this stage with nine world-level players on the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders, and two supporters in the middle of the field, was a serious enemy.
But, with the exception of a 34-minute strike by Nicola Djurdzic, in which the ball passed past the far-reaching bar of Kevin Trupp's gate, they attacked very little.
But at times, SGF has failed to take its own lives by means of non-performing transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimović, who in the first half was unable to carry out at least five attempts and then failed to process the ball that had been struck by Kavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
Nevertheless, he showed himself to be much more capable of accurate pastures, and this was a pass from Ibrahimović, who was given a 52-minute hit by Dee Maria.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of marking thanks to Kavani, after a Uruguayan shot his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic had fixed the ball sent to the center of the field with Maxwell's left flank.
This brought an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and only the capture of the ball by Wyland from a very close distance did not allow David Luis to raise the final score before the replacement of Esquel Lavessi did not count the goal at the very end of the match.
Agé Harade, a trainer in Malme, later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions was held last December."
Since then, we've only played the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
The qualifications are not sufficient.
The glory of the Parry!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencorpor earns $2.5 billion on stock sales.
Switzerland ' s mining and trading giant Glencor, which had been affected by the decline in commodity prices, had earned $2.5 billion in equity sales as part of its ambitious debt reduction plan.
Glencor, a London Stock Exchange company, made a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value, was attempting to deal with the collapse of commodity prices while China's economy was worsening demand and creating chaos in global markets.
Thanks to the release of new shares at a concessionary price, the Glencor share on the London Stock Exchange took off in early morning tenders on Wednesday.
The shares jumped by 2.77 per cent to 13160 pens under the FTSE 100 index, which was traded at the opening of 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencorpor started selling shares worth $2.5 billion last week as part of extensive plans to reduce his 30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold a new stock of 125 cents a piece, i.e. a discount of 2.4 per cent to the price when the bidding was closed on Tuesday.
It placed 1.3 billion new shares, representing 9.99 per cent of the company ' s statutory capital.
Fears of continuing declines in the Chinese economy have reduced the value of iron ore by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials have fallen by 20 to 40 per cent.
The White House confirms C. Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House confirmed on Tuesday that C. Jinping, head of China, would arrive on an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, the first Ci Qingping visit to Washington, D.C., will take place on 25 September and will be a return visit to the visit of President Barack Obama to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michel Obama, will also welcome Ci Jinpin and his wife, Peng Liuan, at the government dinner the same evening after the two leaders are holding bilateral talks.
"The visit of President Si Jinping will provide an opportunity for increased cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will allow the Presidents of the United States and China to engage constructively in the consideration of controversial topics," the communication says.
It is expected that Ci Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, will stop in Seattle to meet the leaders of several major American technology companies on their way to Washington, D.C., and then go to New York to participate in the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Si Jinging are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns regarding the alleged cyberspionage by China and China's growing categoricality over the disputed South China Sea area.
The beating of the biker at the Kutuzova disaster has received two years of the colony.
In addition, the court partially granted the victims ' civil claims to Denis Mirzoev, worth 1.2 million roubles.
The Doromilov court of Moscow sentenced Denis Mirzoev to death, who killed a motorcyclist on the Kutuzov Avenue in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years ' imprisonment in a colony.
He is found guilty under the article “Victim of traffic and the use of vehicles” of the Criminal Code.
In addition, the Court partially granted civil claims to the victims in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
During the discussions of the parties, the prosecutor requested that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and that his claims against the victims in full be brought to eight million roubles.
The accident in question took place on 22 May at about three o'clock in the area of the 30 Kutuzov Avenue.
The BMW, driven by Mirzoev, crossed the traffic lane and hit a rider standing on the side of the road.
The man died on the spot from injuries sustained in 1989.
Friends of the victim on social networks reported that the driver of the BMW was driving at high speed before the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape responsibility, the bikers set up a race from the Vorobier Mountains to the GUMVD Moscow building on Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it was reported that the investigation had delayed the alleged perpetrator of the accident.
In Moscow, a naked man was detained in the temple.
He was calm and did not commit any misconduct, and the police handed him over to the doctors for emergency psychiatric care.
A Moscow resident, who had entered one of the temples without clothing, was arrested by police officers from the capital.
Moscow reports on this.
As told by the Head of the Media Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Moscow, Andrei Galiacberov, the incident took place on Tuesday, 15 September, about 4:00 p.m., on the Kashmir Road.
Nicholas ’ temple was entered by a naked man.
He was calm and did not commit any wrong.
The police came to the scene on the call.
The law enforcement officers waited for doctors from the emergency mental health team and handed them over to the man.
They were 26 years old in Moscow.
More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tuman Region, Vladimir Yakushev, at a meeting of the Bureau of the Regional Government.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds to educational and health facilities in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, provision is made for the purchase of a bus for a school in the Bajamtawdin district and for the major repairs to the district hospital in the Kazan district.
As the accompanying documents state, the money will be used to complete major repairs to the second floor of the treatment room.
Hot and cold water, sanitation, electricity and electrical installations, ventilation systems, the front of the building, the renovation of premises, and fire safety and energy conservation will be repaired.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
The second forum of Russia and Belarus regions will be held in Sochi from 17 to 18 September, in which the Tumen delegation, headed by the Governor, will participate.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcome of cooperation is described by the Honorary Consul-General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumeni Vladimir Shughl, who joined the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorović, what are the tasks of the Sochi Forum?
A large-scale activity in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, which are important links between the two States.
It is planned that President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Alexander Lukashenko of the Republic of Belarus will participate in the plenary.
The plenary and sectional sessions will be devoted to the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in implementing industrial policies, legal and regulatory support and programmes of the Federal State.
The Governor of the Tumen Region will address the forum.
I think that is an indication of the successful, interregional cooperation of the region and Belarus.
Representatives of line ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tuman region, will be operational.
I hope that the forum will help to bring about new and beneficial contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk last June.
More than 200 delegates participated, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important cooperation treaty has been signed between the Tumen and Minsk regions.
The importance of our work is also reflected in the fact that a permanent seminar was held in Tumena at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, a delegation from the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study Belarusian experience in agricultural training, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in agro-industries.
You met recently with the head of the region and the head of the city.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with Governor Vladimir Yakushev of the Tumen State, he spoke of the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus under current difficult circumstances.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be raised - they are needed to reduce the cost of end-user machines.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Belshin Tumen Trade House and in options for prevention of loss.
Questions are important, as investment projects need to work well and generate profits for the region.
Reference was made to the further supply of passenger and cargo equipment from the MAZ OAO, the development of the service centre of the MAZ, which was established in Tumeni at the TAPAP OAO.
The discussion also touched upon the preparation of a visit by a working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the current year.
Another topic of the discussion was the finalization and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the region of Tumena and the Republic of Belarus.
The dynamics of relationships thus promise to move to a new level.
The regional centre was also involved.
During the meeting with the head of the city of Tumeni, Alexander Moror, we talked about the renewal of the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses were already breathing into frankincense, and a new batch of vehicles from Belarus would be required to operate on gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect is that the Tuman elevator plant cooperates with one of the leading producers of the Mogilliftmash oil products of the Mogilliftmash OAO, receiving the components.
In my view, this could become more active given the programmes to install new elevators at the regional centre.
I add that within the framework of the extended mandate of the Consul, a meeting was held with the Governor of Kurgan Province, Alexei Cocorin, during which the issue of increased trade and supply of modern Belarusian technology in Zaural was discussed.
A meeting with the Omma Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The extended consular district is composed of five constituents of the Russian Federation, but the prison can be described as the district headquarters.
The region is a platform for many promising projects, including the work of an honorary gendules.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good in enabling the immediate and rapid resolution of many of the problems, reducing their severity and promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current context, it is essential not to destroy the site while continuing to work forward.
Matt Damon against focusing on the ethnic diversity of filmmakers
Matt Damon argued with Afroamerican producer Effy Brown, saying behind the scenes that ethnic composition was not necessary.
During the Sunday show Project Greenlight on HBO, a famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative perspectives on the main black heroin in the scenario chosen for the project.
"Multiculturality is appropriate when you cast for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
You know, Brahun, not believing her ears, was offended by "Oh, wow, well, well," all the time, while the Martian actor was giving comments on live.
The production colleagues Ben Affleck and Farelli brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I'd like participants -- no matter who's going to be a director -- to think about what kind of interpretation of the Harmoni image they're going to follow," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute hit by a white pimp.
The film's producer, Bear White People, advocated that Leo Angelos and Christen Brancacci become film directors; Damon was strongly opposed to saying, "In the end, we can get the wrong thing."
After this discussion was shown on television, social networks were blown up by unfavorative comments addressed to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni spoke angrily about the video "Explaining Diversity From Matt Damon to the Only Black Person in THE TOKO BELOE Room, which hurts."
Twitter has gained more than 5,000 retwits and 4,000 "labours".
Damon's comments appear at the very moment when the sound coverage of the racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in 2014, Black Lives Matter became popular throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colour population.
In February, Prince's singer referred to this movement during his presentation of candidates to the album Year Awards ceremony.
"Alboms are still important," he said.
As books and the lives of black people, albums are still important.
More recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News staff member Elizabeth Hasselbeck as to whether this group would be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," told the leaders of the movement.
It has recently been announced that Damon is on the list of personalities of the show business, producers and media magnets invited to visit the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
We don't know if the actor accepted the invitation and whether he was dating the Pope.

The professional rock and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero became the first winner of American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening, taking home a $1 million prize.
At this sport show, the 7th season of which is just over, none of the participants have been able to get through all the steps of the road with the obstacle.
In the final part of the season, two participants, Caldier and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task was a 75 - foot - long [75 - foot - long] - up in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to do the task and did it at the scheduled time, becoming the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warrior, who went through stage 4, but Caldiero did it three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After a victory with incredible difficulty, Caldiero, who was shocked to have won a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
"It's incredible to think about it, but I've never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year," comments Isaac to journalists E!
And all of a sudden... I've never even imagined what it would be like... the future is unknown.
The executive producer Kent Wyd met with journalists at The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Britten, who was the first on the road, won't get any cash prize.
According to the rules, money gets the fastest participant.
"If the top players are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them," he said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes lives, it still has great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels hurt about it.
He's happy about what he did.
He got tons of excited feedback from the fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "if someone was supposed to lose, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same if we were to switch roles.
The Americana Ninja Warrior show will return with the eighth season, which will start filming in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers is quietly around Minnesota Twivins.
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers, is now in the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
Pretending only to be an obstacle, Tigers, with glamour, won on Tuesday at Minnesota Twivins with a total of 5-4 at Targuet Field.
"Twins" missed a chance to cut the half-game gap from Houston Astros and take the second place in the play-off game by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroits, even for one night, it was a return of the word to the letter F, which ran away from them most of the second half of the season.
"All the winners are fun, no matter how much they get," said the manager of Tigers Brad Osmus.
Pietcher "Tigers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution to supporting the attacks, resulting in Detroit getting three points in the first two innings, then adding another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pilot at 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third qualitative start in nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good indicators," said Simon.
Pitchers can't give up every game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
Victor Martinez, appointed reflector of the Tigers, was able to beat three beats and hit two wounds, the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strokes from the time of four hits in the game against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with the bat," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (the quality of the batter) and was better at the batting work and kept that quality for the game.
After taking three wounds in the second half of Inning 7, Twins got their best chance to get back to the game.
The central host, Byron Baxton, opened the inning to the left-hand side of the field.
Ritfielder Aaron Hicks took the first base, and the second Baseman Brian Dozier got a strike out of Simon before he took his seat with the leftist Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked past Moera, the only player on the road before the newly appointed reflector of Miguel Sano who beat the two-way single to the left of Drew Werhagen.
With a couple of Ranners not in the aut and comparing wound at the second base of the Verhagen, Trevor Pluff's third bassman was able to be taken to the depths.
It was the 27th time for a leading league player this season when Pluff hit a ball on the high ground.
After Detroit added backup wounds in the first half of the ninth Inning, Moeer earned RBI's "dible" in the space between the outsiders against Bruce Rondón's closing pilot, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-wing player beat Sano after three strikes and got his fifth seyve.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, who was temporarily out of practice at the beginning of the game.
Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pilot who was on the trauma list until the game itself, missing more than a month in connection with the burning of the lumbar.
"It's certainly not the kind of start I'd like," said Hughes, "but as the game developed, I felt more comfortable and I was able to do some pretty good drops in the third inning."
After the first bitter got to the first base, Hughes threw a single to the second bassman Ian Kinsler.
The eye at the two Rythfieldr J. D. Martinez's shoes led by Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Víctor Martinez finished his "0 over 21" series with the Ranners in an effective position.
A third base player, Nick Castellanos, followed by a single with another wound, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to get closer to the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
Tigers increased the score in the second inning, receiving a single-point "dable" from the catcher James McCann and a two-aut single from the central reflection of Anthony Goose, which became 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said Paul Molitor, "Twins' manager.
He didn't hit very well, but he got straight to the right point.
Hughes, whose eyebrows were considered to have been dropped in unapplied third ininga, was replaced by the right-wing religion of A. J. Ahter.
Hughes counted three wounds for six hits and an eye with four strike-outs.
NOTE: Pietcher's Tigers Right, Anibal Sánchez, withdrew from the players due to the extension of his right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed shoulder surgery on Sánchez as early as 2007.
For Sánchez, who has been on the list of injuries since mid-August, the launch is scheduled for Wednesday.
In the absence of Sánchez, PET Daniel Norris will leave the list of injuries and turn against Twins.
Norris, who left the Tigers in four rounds since his acquisition in exchange for David Pryce's petrite on July 30th, has one victory and one defeat.
He hasn't played since 20 August because of the sprain of the muscle.
Tigers and Twinns will complete a series of three games at Targuett Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be played against by Hervin Santana's playman-rights (5-4, ERA 4.73).
Kadyrov's original complaint to the South Sakhalin Court on Molba to God.
In the Southern Sakhalin City Court, the original appeal by President Chechnya Ramzan Kadarirov was filed against the decision to recognize the “extreme material” of the book Molba to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam, and interfax refers to the President of the Horud Alexander Chuhray.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the participants in the proceedings.
The Chuhray refused to comment on the statements made by some of the members of the State of the Russian Federation regarding the need to test the bitterness of possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
"Let them themselves comment on such foolishness," he said.
On 11 September, the City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natali Perchenko's decision to recognize the book as “extreme material”.
An appeal came from the South Sakhalinska Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday evening.
There are nuances: in the Public Prosecutor's Office, they believe that they have asked the court to declare extremist only the opinion of the author of the book, not that of the Koran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision," Chuhray reported.
The decision to recognize the book as “extreme material” was adopted on 12 August 2015.
In particular, the sayings of the Quran, "We worship you and we pray to you for help", and "Do not invoke anyone besides Allah."
Kadyrov called the decision makers on the book "chaitans and provocations".
He called on State officials to prohibit by law judicial decisions relating to texts of sacred writings.
“I am firmly convinced that the State should adopt a law prohibiting judicial decisions relating specifically to the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures”, wrote Kadyrov in his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments that offend migrants and refugees
The Facebook staff intends to remove posts and comments that have a negative impact on migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about illegal content.
It is the intention of the Facebook leadership, together with the German Ministry of Justice, to combat xenophobia and racism on the network.
The previous day, for example, Heiko Maas, the head of the department, stated that the ministret was currently working with the social media to establish a special group of moderaters.
It was the duty of participants to monitor and remove uncorrected comments on migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, the authors of the non-consensual posts are expected to receive notifications indicating the reason for their deletion.
Organizations whose professionals are involved in collecting complaints from the social media about abusive posts should also facilitate the rapid closure of unlawful content.
The Facebook management intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative language against migrants and refugees, the management of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice had been taken after xenophobic sentiments had risen sharply in the German Facebook segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that had reached the European Union some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all the locations intended to accommodate refugees are already overcrowded.
The previous day, the authorities had decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced settlers from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In Moscow cemeterys, areas for relaxation will appear.
In the near future, a number of capital cemeterys are equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
The first will be Butovsky, Domodedsky, and Shcherbina cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest had already appeared at the Troekurus cemetery in Moscow.
Such sites will then be available in other parts of the city.
This portal, m24.ru, was described by Artem Ekimov, who holds the post of Head of the State Budget Institute “Ritual”.
Relay zones will represent small, green areas that resemble parks.
Experts believe that in such coals, visitors to the cemeterys will be able to rest, stay alone and re-establish psychological strength.
Relaxation areas will soon be built in Domodow, Butovsky and Shcherbin cemeterys and later in other parts of the capital.
According to the chapter of the Ritaal GBU, if the area of the cemetery is to be expanded, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest areas to the maximum extent possible.
Green plantations will serve as living fences that will separate rest areas and areas directly placed in burial sites.
The Ritaal GBU also announced its intention to make a proposal for renunciation of the fences at the graveyards.
New cemeterys can indeed become barrierless.
In addition, Ritaal, GBU, described the willingness to install electronic terminals that would enable visitors to learn about GPS coordinates and license plates of graves.
In June of this year, Ritaal GBU also proposed adjustments to the cost of burial services according to the time of the year.
For example, the digging of graves in summertime will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, a week in winter, when the earth is frozen.
Note that over the past year, prices for all ritual services have averaged 10 per cent.
Five days later, a lost fungus was found in the Elník woods.
An elderly man found himself alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours without food in the woods.
A joint effort by rescuers and volunteers has led to the detection of mountain graves.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old pensioner from Tambow province spent five days in the woods."
Without food and water.
His family, rescuers, volunteers were looking for him.
There were even Kinologists with dogs, but no results.
A man was identified after a helicopter was involved in the search.
That day Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods to get the boils and backers, but he didn't come back by evening.
Family members immediately sought help, and the next day, rescuers and inequitable residents from a nearby village — only about 30 people — were raised to search for the mushroom.
A fire and rescue helicopter joined them for the fifth day.
Andrei Seletkov, the chief of the rescue and search team of the Smolen District Fire and Rescue Centre, said, "The Vertolet was attracted, the man was found."
He went very far, completely elsewhere.
It was about 12 kilometers from the search site.
He's gone a huge distance at his age.
It's a miracle to be alive.
The mushroom was taken to the Yale district hospital unconscious, in a very difficult state.
He was diagnosed with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and overcooling.
As an elderly man managed to survive after five days in the woods, doctors do not know at all.
Valentine Nepsha, head of the Elenin CRB therapeutic department: "A patient's examination, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Given all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, it's still heavy, but it's positive.
A pensioner, Vitaly Alexandrovich, comes every year from Tambowskaya region.
His grandson says that his grandfather had gone to pick up mushrooms before, but he never went into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, the grandson of the fungus found, said, "The blade is not far from the road, it's not local in principle."
I have come to visit my relatives for just a few years.
Well, I'm going to get some mushrooms.
He must've gone far away and got lost.
With the start of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolen region.
In the last few days alone, five similar cases.
Saviours remind us that we need to walk in the woods in bright clothing, with a small supply of food, matches, and compasses.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces so that you can return.
An-2 accident sat on a persegre in a fraternal taiga.
Right on the scaffold in Siberia, emergency An-2.
An emergency landing aircraft from Enicei, a red-head airline, took place 68 kilometres from Bratska.
There were no casualties and no casualties, but the aircraft itself suffered significant damage on landing.
An-2 was on a service flight.
There were three crew members on board, a commander, a second pilot and a manned man, reporting to Interfax.
The aircraft took flight along the route of the Ilymsk-Ilymsk, where the airline is based.
The flight crew has already been taken to Bratsk.
The Brotherly Transport Prosecutor's Office, following the emergency landing of An-2, began to verify compliance with aviation safety legislation.
An investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office travelled to the scene.
In September 2010, crew TU-154 landed his plane with passengers because of a technical malfunction at an abandoned cargo airport in Komi.
Engines and on-board electronics were refused on the liner, but the crew did not.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board the aircraft.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
Vesti Economy – Nobel Laureate: Globalization
The process of globalization should have helped to reduce global inequality.
In fact, the situation is different, the income gap in developing economies is growing.
Eric Muskin.
To remedy this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to Eric Maskin, Chief Research Officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of the NIU, Nobel Prize winner for the Economics of 2007.
Over the past 20 years, the world has experienced an unprecedented increase in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more open.
The advocates of globalization had predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," says Maskin.
China and India, for example, have experienced significant per capita GDP growth.
But it's not that good.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the “indigent” and the “indigent” in poor countries, which is reflected in large income inequality and, more precisely, pay.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Muskin in his article “Why the Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequalitys in Developing Economics”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, translated and quoted by WSEC NEE.
Together with economist Professor Michael Cremer Eric Maskin of Harvard University, an alternative theory that demonstrates why income disparities in poor countries are increasing as globalization increases, WSEC is reminded.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Muskin sets four levels of skills - A and B - for the rich countries, C and D for the poor.
After globalization, experts D from poor countries lack the skills to work with professionals A and B from rich countries.
And while low-income workers in poor countries have increased their wages through collaboration with staff members B of the rich, D workers in growth do not feel or are falling at all.
The resulting effect is that internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the pay gap between two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus increase inequality.
Cremer and E. Maskiny offer an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Riardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, ” says Fouad Aleskers, professor of generals, head of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Choices, head of the mathematics department of WIE NIU.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to an upsurge of empirical work in this field.
The solution, according to Eric Muskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves do not have the means to do so, and it is not beneficial for companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, Governments, international agencies, NCBs and private foundations can play a significant role, as Maskin believes.
He noted that the theory developed did not in any way call for a halt to the globalization process, which had produced and produced results in the growth of countries ' GDP.
Derbent: a living connection of time.
Derbent is one of the oldest cities in Russia, and in September he celebrates his 2000th.
In the celebration programme, the national culture festival of the Dagestan people and the past-style fair, the exhibition of the Derbe carpets and Open Temples Day, the historic and music show 2000 in two hours and the tour of Peter I's renovated museum.
The medieval fortresses of Narin-Kala, the ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, the narrow streets and palace gardens, all seem to have come off the pages of the Thousands and One Night.
Derbent is Russia's only city that has been in place since ancient times.
Although he was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Hazarat, and the Golden Order.
The age of the eastern plains, which grow in the court of the combent Duma Mecheti, is several centuries old.
These powerful plants are protected by the All-Russia Program "The Trees of Nature".
The shadow of the cranberries saves pilgrims and tourists during summer heat.
A visitor to the mosque is given sweet tea and served by the Dagastan lacquoises - honey figs, furs, muslums, mites of wonder, airan and sweets.
In Derbent, for centuries, large homemade vending machines have been used to water the teas of numerous guests.
The sign above the entrance to Juma-sword says the building was built in 115H.
I mean, in 733, by the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interviewer is impressed by the scope and solemnity of the domes of the domes of the baths and vaults, which are based on square columns and lit by sunlight from tiny windows.
The maintenance and breeding of pigeons is the traditional attraction of the people of Derbent.
Homebird owners store pigeons in the courtyards, under the trees, on the attics.
The capture of a spectacle is the rise of a bunch of white pigeons, similar to the outbreak of a festival fireworks.
For defence purposes, the ancient Persians closed the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
After going 500 meters into the sea, this building locked the Derbent harbor.
In 2003, Derbent's fortress walls were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of the ancient Persian fortification.
In the fifth century C.E., the carpets in Derbent continued to flow, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for any taste -- strips of wool, cotton, or fork of all colors and shades, with a wart and no one, with a complex design and a delicate cassava.
The construction of the city began with a shantytown with a single - floor stone structure.
Over the years, the throats haven't changed much.
Only satellite plates, wall conditioning, and street lights remind you that you are not in the medieval city but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the Persian plumbing were preserved some thousands of years ago.
To this day, there have been ancient sources of water for the local people today.
Many combs prefer ordinary tap water from verified historical fountains.
Derbent was one of the potter’s centers.
Bulk and painting vases, dishes, pots, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The potter’s hands are still making wonderful pottery for both practical and gift purposes.
On holidays and festivals, a crowd of spectators gather under a tight rope on which students of the Republican School of Circus Arts speak.
The history of amazing and risky skills has lasted several centuries.
The new trend is that girls are increasingly seen among the passersby.
The museum "Culture and Home of the Ancient Derbent" is now operating in the premises of the former Virgin Banya.
Previously, unmarried girls and brides accompanied by friends were bathed, and now anyone who wished could see a doll hall, hot and cold pools that had gone into the past bathing gear.
Most of Derbent's houses have hot water, but baths and steams are popular today just as they used to be.
The benefits of heating the body with steam are found in ancient books.
After the bath, blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, and the body becomes flexible and light.
The Commonwealth Festival, which is held on the premises of the Narin-Kala fortress, is attended by the ethnic subterraneans of many parts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk tunes, sing the songs of the people of the Caucasus, and provide visitors with delicious home cheese.
The crucible is the burial place of forty martyrs who have laid their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most venerable complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
The yellow sarcophagus are cut out of solid stone blocks from time to time and are directed, as is the custom among Arabs, on the west-east axis.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubov cut and snuck their clients in a small cabin near the Upper Market.
The barber has been here for many years.
The handicrafts are passed from generation to generation.
However, Jakubov’s brothers can do not only a traditional hairstyle but also a modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old City, there was a house in which Alexander Bestujev-Marlinski, a decabrist writer, lived in the Caucasus.
After learning the Turkic language and collecting the ethnographic material, he described the Derbent of the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, his life, and his household.
Chihana is a traditional Eastern club where only tea and homemade bakeries are served.
Men come here to covet thirst, to communicate with friends and to solve any working problems.
As in past times, women are not encouraged to cross the teahouse threshold.
The Derbent dance band “Caspey” was established three years ago but has been able to participate in Republic and Russian events.
Soloists rehears every day, breaking up with perfection the folk dances of the Avian, Darfurian, Tatian, Armenian.
As evening comes, when the noise and street lights are low, the locals are placed on benches near houses with rising terraces.
As a general rule, recruits discuss domestic issues.
But in the run-up to the anniversary, they increasingly recall the episodes of the unique history of their city that affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
Domodeda had a business game at the airport.
A new form of education is being offered in the capital.
Four hundred students tried as airport staff.
To that end, the Domodow model was built by three aircraft.
Not only did the young people inspect and register passengers but they also served the aircraft.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but it has not given way to reality.
The late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, lost the trip somewhere along the way to the plane.
For a real airport, hell.
For someone who's settled in the Domodeda hangar, it's a standard set of tasks for newcomers to do.
Three large airports from around the world were accommodated in one hangar.
There are now four hundred students in the capital colleges and higher education.
It's an unprecedented chance to get to know everything about the internal world of airlines.
Registration of passengers, maintenance of aircraft, and travel of luggage were entrusted to them even by buses in the field, stairs and passenger searches.
And the passengers, you're gonna be in trouble.
One's in trouble with the documents, another's late for the flight, the third one's filling the bag with suspicious objects.
And we need to deal with all of this as we do in life, at the minimum.
For each of these tasks it is charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if it had been paid by the airline to service the voyage.
“They are fined for failure to do so”, explains the Vesti-Moscow financial analyst for the game of Dimitri Hilko.
Officials from the Ministry of Education follow closely.
For them, this examination is an attempt to test a new form of study.
She has already been placed in secondary vocational education.
“There will be six interregional centres of competence, which will in fact be new models of the activities of modern colleges with modern management systems, highly skilled personnel and modern equipment”, explains the Director of the Department of State Policy in the area of labour training and additional vocational education of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Natalie Goldareva.
But students aren't for global plans.
After three days of training, they seem to need a weekend.
At the same time, the evaluation of the examination was quite material.
Newest smarties I've ever seen!
"I've got them for responding to our airport claim at Instagram in a timely manner," "I'm pleased with the game participant, the Pierar-Man of the Aeroport Frankfurt team, Sergey Shovaw.
The best judges, called the judges, were taken to the pencil to be invited to work by the time they completed their studies.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the foreign literature at the Library of the United States Centre.
The Centre has been operating in Moscow for over 22 years.
The United States Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the US Embassy Center at the M.I. Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
“One-way steps taken recently by the Russian Federation call into question the Russian Government's commitment to relations between Russian and American peoples that have not been interrupted even during the cold war and other difficult times in the long history of our country's relations”, says Ambassador John Tofft of the United States of America in Interfax.
The American Centre has established deep and lasting links between people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was a centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, as well as a venue for meetings with numerous American eminent persons, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"It was last year alone that the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and hosted more than 50,000 Russian visitors," stressed the diplomat.
Tfft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close down another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Educational Exchange Programme.
The Green Tribunal was quickly executed.
Typically, four officials are standing in front of Judge Swanter Kumar ' s desk, hearing his claims for work.
The Court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make you laugh at him,' says Kumar.
If there's any other brick, we're gonna have to tear down all the existing buildings.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial authority established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution of the environment, which has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal was able to consider more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and construction of dams.
In two of the three cases, the court decided to cease construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: India has become one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the 60 years since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development.
The problem is particularly acute in large megacities, where infrastructure development is slow to catch up with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with heavy smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few remaining housing areas are being cut down for new housing areas.
Despite the State ' s formal support for the green movement, NZTs are regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as they often become the main reason for the abolition of major investment projects.
In May of this year, for example, the Minister of Environment described the court's decisions as “extremely” and “unimplementable”.
Sometimes court decisions cannot be met within the time limit set by the court, as confirmed by the environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, there is also a positive side to the inexorable deadline: at least they make the responsible persons move.
"His main goal is to shake this system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled major construction projects: it has stopped the construction of the airport, the power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
The same is true of people, for example, during discussions about the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagnan State, which contaminated the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we're also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," said Kumar.
Such explanations, however, are not always understood by ordinary people whose lives can change with a single stroke of the judicial pen.
In April, for example, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, which caused popular indignation.
Despite the dramatic decline in popularity and criticism, Swutter Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Government of New Delhi on entering and leaving vehicles and proposed that 10,000 additional buses should be purchased before they could meet the order.
As sources of pollution, such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents, began to be brought to the attention of the ships, people ' s anger began to subside slightly.
But the most ill-treated subject of the principled judge was the programme to clean up the Ganges River, which was sponsored by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, the Hindus ’ sacred river, the judge often ceases to hold back his emotions and to cry out.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from Ganges into a statue of God, and there were fecals in it, and the judge's hot.
You keep polluting the river because you think the Ganges is the Ganges, he'll take all our sins.
This is the river we worship and see what you do to it every day.
Ganges clean-up is the most ambitious and costly environmental project, announced by the new Government.
At present, the number of fecal bacteria in this river is more than 120 times higher.
Every year between 1.5 and 3 out of 700 million Hindus bathed there die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganges Rescue Fund money from selling his suit, where he met Barak Obama and 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the pontiff of populism: the suit was purchased for $700,000, while the river’s treatment required at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India has a long way to go before it can identify itself as a developed country, but do not believe that the cost of progress should be environmental.
"In a developing country, talk about the environment is often perceived as an impermissible luxury," says an activist of Zov Ganga, Malik Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a golden middleway between ecology and development."
He's bleeding Dali's paintings at the Riga Exhibition.
A visitor to an exhibition by the Latvian Union of Artists in Riga broke the museum's windows and ruined El Salvador Dali's "Establishment of an Angel".
The museum is currently hosting an exhibition of works by El Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
A man born in 1985 entered a hall of sculpture at 2:20 p.m.
He did not do the right thing right away. He ruined the sculpture, broke the windows.

The economy must become more open to the world in order to stimulate its growth, as President Si Jinping said Tuesday in addressing the reform leadership group.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and promoting a policy of openness”, he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Leading Group for the Comprehensive Development of Reforms.

The lead group has adopted a number of directives, including regulation of investors ' access to the market, amendment of border control rules, promotion of public enterprises (SOE) that attract private capital and revision of the resident registration system.
It is stated that a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually fine-tuned through pilot programmes.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, business rule of law and greater openness, as stated in the statement.

The statement also states that China will allow border regions to adopt new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
