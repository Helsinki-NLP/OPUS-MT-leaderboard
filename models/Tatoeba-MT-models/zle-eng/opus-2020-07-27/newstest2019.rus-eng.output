Number of new recruits from Ukraine ready for departure to Donbas
The official representative of the People ' s Police, self-proclaimed Luhan People ' s Republic (LNR), Andrey Marochko, stated that, in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbas.
According to him, this is how Kiev plans "any way of putting units together."
“The refusal of Ukrainian citizens to perform service in the ranks of the Ukrainian SS, mass dismissals have led to a low strength of units”, Marotka, quoted as saying, “RA News”.
Nor did it rule out that the real figures for Ukrainian military personnel could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced with the Joint Forces (JS) operation.
It was expected that this would enhance the role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbasa deteriorated as a result of the assassination of the head of DNR, Alexander Zaharchenko.
The DNR authorities characterized what happened as a terrorist.
During the criminal investigation, several persons involved in the explosion were detained.
It is preliminary to confirm that the occupation of Ukraine was organized by the Ukrainian intelligence services.
The U.S. authorities forced Macka to resign from the presidency of the Tesla Authority
American businessman Ilon Musk will leave office as chairman of the board of directors of the Tesla-based company at the request of the U.S. authorities.
The federal securities and exchanges commission will also pay $20 million to settle claims.

The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs compared the EU with the Soviet Union and the prison
The British Foreign Minister, Jeremy Hunte, compared the European Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capture of member countries of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail points out, Hunt commented on difficulties in the Brexit negotiating process.
What happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was established to protect freedom and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU out of the community into a prison, the desire to leave will not diminish, but will only grow up, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity,” said the Minister.
He also added that trying to punish Britain for its decision to withdraw from Europe would only exacerbate the crisis, notes Hazeta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the Brexit negotiations had been deadlocked.
It thus commented on the outcome of the informal summit of the European Union in Zagreb.
The Brexit decision was adopted in 2016 on the basis of a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place until April 2019, but discussions with Brussels on this issue are complicated by a variety of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.

Ilon Musk is forced to leave the post of head of the Tesla Board of Directors
The Security and Exchange Commission of the United States and founder of Tesla Ilon Musk settled their fraud dispute.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the television channel, Macka would have to leave the post of head of the Tesla Board of Directors as part of the agreements.
At the same time, the Commission allowed Muska to retain the office of head of Tesla.
It is noted that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will also be recovered from Tesla.
At the same time, the money will be distributed among the injured investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American businessman on the list of 50 richest people on the forbes version of the magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX, Neuralik neurotechnics and the author of the Tesla electronics and co-founder Paypal.
The United States Security and Exchange Commission had previously sued the Director General of Tesla Ilon Muska because of his Twitter report about the possible purchase of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares on the exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The cost of an action of $420 was allegedly established “because of the importance of this number in marijuana culture”, reported Bloomberg earlier with reference to the security co-director of Stephen Peykin.
Ilon Musk subsequently refused to buy shares.
Commenting on a lawsuit filed against him by the United States securities and exchanges, the businessman stated that he considered fraud to be unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and troubled by these claims.
"The truth is the most important thing in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn't break it in any way," said the businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, the group of shareholders of Tesla filed a collective complaint against Macka, regretting the financial losses suffered.
The plaintiffs claimed that business officials had caused them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the twitts of a businessman were misleading, forcing the sellers of the Tesla equity to purchase paper at artificially overvalued prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that the careless comments of Ilon Muska had led to sharp fluctuations in course.
In September, Ilon Macka was accused of exchange fraud by the head of the research company Simon Research.
However, if Muske could not settle his dispute with the securities and exchange commission of the United States, he would be in danger of exclusion from the management of the company and even the prison.
The former Chairman of the Harvey Pitt Commission, in particular, spoke about this.
Musk is "a bad guy who can't run a car company."

By the way, this very interesting formal work, I think, was found there in Madrid, but it's not about that at all.

The US and the DPRK were on the threshold of the war, and today the North Korean leader is writing "pretty letters" to the White House, said Trump.

But now their relationship has improved to the extent that the leaders are “in love with each other”.
However, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the United States media interpreted them as incompetence.

All of these are merited by his administration, I'm sure the American President.

In neighboring Poland, for example, she said that Russian speech had been widely used earlier on television and radio, but there was little in the public space.
However, according to Nits, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian are, in her view, only “an extension of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Nice had previously shared her experience in maintaining the Ukrainian-speaking regime at the Carpathian Children's Camp, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened a network of Watsons bookshops, one of which was contacted by one of them on Russian.
Without reaching her, Nitsa threw herself into a girl's hand.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians has been called "pain schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in writing a name.

Actually, I felt good.
Maybe at the end, a little bit of force to make things happen.
Yes, Doctor and Physician Vladimir Anatolewic Gashneev brought me to this game, and thank them so much!
"What about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It is no secret to anyone that, after victory and recovery, it is easier, and a feeling of good in the collective.
Now we had a white strip, though it was black at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and be pleased with the fans."
"Found on the game at the time "that didn't get out on the field?"
"This is a bit boring, because indeed, an unpleasant situation has come out.
But to repeat again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors, who put it on their feet.

And the rest of it's all minor."

The day before, it was known that the Serbian President had led the State army to be fully militarized because of the situation in Kosovo.
This is what happened last Friday, when a number of dozens of Kosovo authorities entered the area that is adjacent to the lake providing water to the gas station.
It is specified that the GoE in question is located in Kosovo, but it refers to the Serbian power system.
We recall that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, but in Belgrade this fact was denied.
Last spring, the parties stopped negotiating on this issue.

Cosachev: At the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, Russia ' s theme was practically absent from the negative side.
The head of the Federation ' s Committee on International Affairs, Constantine Kosachiev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a success for Russia and does not rule out its ability to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global world problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric that we have almost been accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been on the order of a more confounded subject”, said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation had at one time “marked as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola fever, the Russian Federation was among those included, in any case, in a statement made by a group of Western countries which was quite unanimous in that regard”.
At the 73rd session, he emphasized that “the darkness of Russia was practically missing”.
"If you carefully examine the statement made by the President of France, the President of the United States, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or British, in any case, the choir was not exactly accurate," he pointed out to the politician, noting that Russia “was more than a wall trained by tennis ball strikes."
The head of the Swfed Trade Committee does not exclude that this indicates a certain trend, which he believes would “submit the current session [of the United Nations], although this trend may be fully visible in a year, two, three”.
“I do not rule out that the present session in a sense may be a turning session”, explained Kosachev, “when many examples of how Russia's engagement has been able to move forward in international affairs”.
He cited the situation in Syria, Iran and North Korea as an example.
“Unhappily, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will, too, be lost in time,” added the parliamentarian.
This is linked to what he believes is the emergence of “an adequate, healthy view of Russia as not just a possible, integral participant in the global problems of our time”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have the feeling that somewhere we're going through a point where we're no longer moving backwards, it's going forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Cosachiev called “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should evolve”.
“I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, and I had my own meetings, and I had great pleasure in seeing that, if one year or two or five years ago, Russia’s view of what was happening in the world, in large measure, no one had any interest, the situation would be different now,” said the Chairman of the Swoffed Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order, which is associated with the West, has no answers to questions about how to deal with the world's problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, a lack of ideas on how to address the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, the problems of migration”.
“And the request for a Russian vision is becoming increasingly clear”, expressed Coach's confidence, stressing that in this sense, “the current session is good for the work of the Russian delegation, which is good for Russia”.

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib

He said that Syria had a right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the withdrawal of fighters prohibited by the Russian organization Jebchat al-Nusr from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports the RA News.

On 17 September, Putin and President Recep Erdogan of Turkey agreed to establish by 15 October a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led a youth team called Chelsea.

She said that under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris these days, there was an attack that was declared hungry by the participants to demand the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural leaders, some of them also have well-known people, hungry, supporting Oleg Senzov, other Cremlin politicians, and, of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interviews, wherever the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, pressure to put pressure on the Kremlin, put pressure on Putin with one demand: the liberation of Olga, the liberation of Romana, the release of all the political prisoners of Kremlin and of those who are illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbasa and Crimea,” Heračenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the tests will kill every Ukrainian, making us “wicked, bitterer in protecting Ukraine's national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil”.
Remember, Roman Sushenko, a French correspondent, was arrested by Russian forces at Moscow airport on 30 September 2016.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage at the General Intelligence Department of Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushenko to 12 years of a high-security colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as lawful.
Russian jailers complied with the Ukrainian's last request before being sent to the colony.

Vachtang Kikabize on cancer
Many artists are now talking about how they managed to cope with the oncology.
Unfortunately, the disease has not spared anyone, and the stories of popular people about winning cancer give hope to many who are ill.
The famous actor Vachtang Kikabbedze confessed that he had only lived because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which was pronounced a sentence.
"I feel like I've been hit by a hammer down the skull.
I fell down.
Lost the orientation.
They put it in the hospital.
There was a spoon that couldn't hold, standing up, falling all the time.
We started to do tests, turns out that things are bad, that the artery doesn't give up blood.

Hennadiy Onishenko, deputy of the State Office of the Russian Federation (in the radio interview, Guatrit Moscow):
In the general sex education of children, this needs to be done in the context of the loss, because there is a risk of a child's sexual health, both male and female.
The problem is objective, it is that the ripening of children is early enough, and there are further large feet between their sexual maturity and the possibility of formal contact between the police.
According to Onishenko, the problem is hampered by “hospitalism”, “sexual disease” and the lack of a culture of adequate child education.

AdH became Germany’s second - second - World Popular
The Anti-Mimigran "Alternary for Germany" is another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that Germans have begun to take seriously the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which has made the country the leading target of millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most recently, this is reflected in recent social questions, according to which the anti-migrantish party Alterativa for Germany is becoming more popular and the position of the ruling Merkel and Zeechofer bloc is getting weaker.
This week the AG won another record by taking the second line of popular sympathy ratings.
Right-wing conservatives with 17% popularity have been able to bypass social democrats, who have about 16%.
The gap in one percentage point can be written off as a statistical error, but it is not surprising that the 2013 AG, created by a small group of economist-Jerosqueptists, has succeeded in becoming a major political force.
Generally set-ups continue to hold the ruling HSS/SDS cluster, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there appears to be a trend towards loss of points - as early as April, support for the Angela Merkel bloc was four percentage points higher.
The German Chancellor's personal rating, which is headed by the German Government for the fourth consecutive term, has also been reduced.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans are in support of Angela Merkel, 7 per cent lower than last year.
Add that social democracy is followed by green (15%), left (11%) and liberals (10%).
The evolution of the “Alternatives”
The "Alternatives for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the “Alternative Choice 2013” group, which included participants from the Christian Democratic Union.
The Group had initially joined the opposition to the Government's course, but at the outset, only economic issues had been addressed, including Euros and EU engagements.
In doing so, the group opposed Germany's “responsion” of weak EU economies, without excluding the return of the German mark and the complete withdrawal of the country from the European Union.
In the face of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of AdH has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed part of a full-fledged party, which took over the niche of Europeans and began to severely criticize the Government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the most recent parliamentary elections in 2017, the AG was able to take a stand for the first time in Bundestag, with 94 deputies (out of 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternatives for Germany" from the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist calling Ukrainian citizens the “Nation of Bulgarians”
The leading political show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books by Ostap Drazdov, admitted in live air that he believed his compatriots were “an act of blundering”.
They believe TV and they don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, living and working in such a country is difficult.
"We have not been taught a culture of reading and listening to texts since childhood," declared the journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozd’s words, accusing him of his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the Independent State Committee on Television and Radio has begun to combat literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, prohibiting as much as 201 entry.
Manchester City played Briton and came to APF leaders

"Rosel Senator APC Bronevik"
It's not just video games, movies, and bookshops that make money on the subject.
Now the new home is also used by car companies.
For example, Canada's Rosel Defence Constructions presented its apricotty to the Senator APC.
The engineers of the company create a reservation for the police, free from fantasy.
Rochel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who, without special comfort, are housed in an obsolescence-affiliated armore.
This bunker, or you won't name it, because its reservation level meets Standard B7, is set on the chassis of a powerful pickup truck by Ford Super Duty.

There are no chances of being stuck in the whole armpit of an apolysis, Rosel Senator APC
A special exhibition in Washington, D.C., will be available to see the accompaniment of Rosel Senator APC.
Name of the term of death of the universe
The universe is still living around 140 billion years, ten times as old as the world around 13.8 billion years.
A study by an international team of scientists is placed in the library of electronic precursors, arXiv.org, and is aimed at publishing the publication of the Asahi Shimbun of Japan, a Japanese newspaper.
Experts have come to such conclusions by observing about ten million galaxies of the Subaru telescope using a HSC camera (H Hyper Suprim-Cam).
In the light of the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 per cent of the energy of the observed world, scientists, working under the standard Space Model  requested by the United Nations, measured the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously assumed.
The Subaru Observatory press release notes that observations have resulted in a detailed three-dimensional mother distribution map in the universe, while the recording of Planck ' s European space telescope data has clarified the limitations imposed on the CCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments for the world to cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great divide.
A further attempt was made to bring together the co-sponsors of the pension referendum
The possibility of learning the people's views on pension reform is postponed indefinitely.
A meeting of the general federal initiative group for the referendum against promotion of retirement was held in Moscow on Saturday.
Representatives of 13 sub-groups who had recorded different language issues (the entire central staff registered five wordings).
They decided to apply to the CIC for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians: “Do you wish to ensure that, as at 1 July 2018 the age at which citizens of Russia are entitled to an old age pension does not increase?”
The wording was registered by a volunteer sub-group whose representatives were not present in the congregation, but was considered to be the most simple and legally feasible.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of the members of the Fair Russia Ilya Sviridov (six sub-groups) and CPRF (four sub-groups).
Three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronje, and Orenburg, joined them.
Sviridov used to say "Vowies" that the invitations had been sent to all the sponsors, and representatives of about 40 sub-groups agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenanov, who is the head of the Voldemorean sub-group (this wording was supported by another 15 sub-groups), said, "Enjoyments," that the invitation was not received and that it was not planned, "We didn't understand who is the friend and who is the enemy."
He died a brilliant singer, Otis Rush.
At 84 years of age, a well-known Chicago blue guitarist and singer, Otis Rush, died, referring to his manager, Rika Bates.

"Admiral" created big problems for us
Zinthula Bilaletdinov: "Admiral" created a big problem for us.
The chief coach, Ak Barsa, Zinette Bilaletdinov, took the score of the regular CHL championship v. Admiral (4:2).
"The hard game was hard.
A rival fought decently, creating big problems for us.
I'm glad we played pretty well today.

That's why it was the decision,' brings out the words of the Bellaletdin Press Service of the club.
Ilon Musk will leave the post of head of the Tesla Board of Directors
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk would have to leave the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the post of Chief Executive Director of the company, reporting AFP with reference to the regulator ' s data.
Tesla would also have to pay a $20 million fine.
The regulator had previously filed an action against Ilon Macka - officials who believed that he had misled Tesla’s investors, since the businessman had allowed the purchase of all of the company’s stock at a high price of $420 per paper.
In Loco's match, "Amath" was the mistake of Turbin, like an obsolescence horn.
The former Supreme Judge, Vladimir Levitin, commented on the work of arbitrator Eugene Turbin on the Russian championship Lokomoot, Akhmat, and reviewed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you judge Evgenia Turbina on Lokomoote's "Ahmat"?
- I believe this arbitrator confirmed his rejection of the justices of the Russian Prime League.
I'm surprised that the fifth round of "Spartacus" - "Dinamo" and "Turbin" and the MSRI leaders did not make serious conclusions about his low skills.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: the errors in his actions, and private oblivion passes were shriveled like an oblivion corner.
For example, at the 50th minute, Edra's railway is handcuffed in Rodolfo 's Achmata defence area.
It's eight meters away from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put the panels.
- How do you feel about the 8nd minute Idow episode, when the ball appeared to have fallen into his hand?
- I believe there was a deliberate play of the lawyer's hand in his fine area.
Turbin was right next to the moment, and he saw the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This was also the time that a reserve judge, Sergey Karasev, was to be seen.
Nevertheless, all three were gone, and the panels were not appointed.
Therefore, the score for the match is distorted, and sports justice is wrong.
It was the very moment that justice had driven out and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- At the 52nd minute, Turbin had no intention of removing the attorney of the guests Oleg Ivanov who broke the rules in the fight against Krykjak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he had a demonized applause.
What do you think of this episode?
Should we have shown the second mustard?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card showed me wrong.
The second one would be illogical.
- Aleg Ivanov said after the match that there were double standards of justice that some teams were putting on panels for violations, such as in the Idow episode and not in any other case.
What do you appreciate from football?
- I don't know what to mean by double standards.
There was the penalty.
He wasn't given.
Therefore, the arbitrator does not allow the second panel to enter the opposite gates.
That's the principle that's being used.
And the second moment of double standards, that a judge is watching who plays.
There's been some serious claims for Turbin's work on Saturday's Lokomoolt and Ahamata, because the crew was disadvantaged.
Matt Damon played an accused of rape by Judge Kavano at the SNL start
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate in the U.S. Supreme Court of Britta Kavano, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first edition of the New Year's Day Night Live season on TV NBC.
In a small heck, the actor played Cavanano at the Senate hearings on the charge of rape.
The candidate before the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailed stories during a discussion with Senator Amy Clobuchar.
Cavanano, for example, repeatedly admitted his love of beer, but said that he had never been drunk.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on the charge of rape, Kavano claimed that he had been a virgin during that period.
Damon also played these points.
I've only done that I've been drinking a lot, and I haven't thought about sex.
I was the proudest, most drunken virgin anyone's ever seen.
'The judge in the execution of Matt Damon is familiar with this,' said the judge.
Cavanano was elected supreme judge of the United States.
Barbra Strozend discovered strange behaviour in his cloned dogs
A American singer, Barbra Strazand, stated that her dead dog’s clones behave quite differently than the original pet.
"They're not alike.
"In fact, [the clones] look like she but cannot clone the soul," stressed a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streysand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old coton detuber dog, known as Samson, who had to be put to sleep because of health problems.
In July of 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua dog, called Wonder Milli, was cloned 49 times by the world's smallest dog.
Professionals are trying to clone a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
U.S. is thinking of Russia's maritime blockade due to oil and gas supplies
In the United States, Russia can begin a maritime blockade in order to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The American authorities are so active in the struggle for success in the world's hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the Russian maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's major energy suppliers.
On the possibility of a maritime embargo the previous day, President Ryan Zinke of the United States Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior is not police, but civilian functions, including natural resources policies.
Zinke’s statement therefore came under the authority of his department, even though it was not devoid of political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that the United States Navy had the power to control and freeze maritime routes in the Middle East.
From Zinke's words, it was clear that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world's energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive the lion's share of its revenues from the supply of oil and gas to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main reason for the growth of Moscow in the region, I am sure of Zinka.
The Minister made it clear that the U.S. continues to provide leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest oil and gas supplier.
For this to happen, Washington will have to shake Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes, an acceptable measure in this direction, is considered by Zinke.

Russia has a club for which I'm watching
Former captain of Chelsea and England's assembled John Terry - why went to the ninth culture of the Russian championship Spartacus - "Rosts".
"I have a club in Russia that I'm watching.
It was quite a while ago that I was interested in looking at him from the side.
I can't say I am a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have the sympathy for Spartacus, and I want to apologize for the decision I made,
Remember, "The Rock" rose to the third place in the tournament table with 18 points, and "Spartacus" was placed on a fifth line, with an asset of 15 points.
In the next round, on 7 October, the red and whites play with Enisei on their exit, while the Trustee, Valérie Carpin, has been received earlier by Orenburg on the day before.
The expensive violin was turned over to the Lombard for insignificance
When a man in the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, Lombard LBC Boutique and Loan brought a violin for an old and unprofited tool, a lebard worker offered only $50.
But the experienced store manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and sought advice from the expert.
Here it turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinand Galiano, estimated at $250,000.
Only a jump to the violin is estimated to be $168,000.
The investigation revealed that the violin had not been stolen from one of the city ' s residents for some time and that the instrument had been restored to the rightful owner.
As long as it is not known how the violin fell upon the man who dropped it into the Lombard, there is no previous conflict with the law.
Manager says now everyone bringing a violin into the Lombark is asking to play it to make sure it really belongs to the customer.
In the ninth round of the RPF, we have an exciting confrontation: "Spartacus" will take a "Rost" at its stadium in Tushina, under the leadership of Valérie Carpina, a human being, as is known, not to be a foreign national team.
The special pictoriality of this meeting is that clubs now have an equal number of points of 15 and they divide 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, keeping away from the far-reaching Zenita, and in one eye from the transducer, which is playing with Dinamo tomorrow.
The red and whites are now a difficult lane: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, Massismo Carrera's team in the League of Europe took off suddenly the Rapida, and recently went to Akhmatu's house.
After a break from the CSA, which ended in a fair night, Spartacus, with a minimum count, played in Chernomonic Cuba, and it was too early to tell whether Russia's most popular club was closer to breaking out of the crisis.
The three in a row couldn't win, but the wounds don't have five.
Let's see if Carpin can extend this gameless series of principles to himself.
The previous meeting of the Karpin “Rust” and “Spartak” ended in favor of the capital team.
It's 7:00 p.m.

London was alarmed by charges against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, said British Defence Minister Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during his speech at the Congress of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threat is increasing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, the enemies are operating in the grey zones by means of cyberattacks and false news, and the Minister added.
But the greatest of these is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians in Moscow have been refuted and transmitted to the TTSS.
Then, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, reported that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international regulations and use chimurry.
Hunt mentioned a story of poisoning in the English city of Solsbury last March by GUR Colonel Sergey Scripal, convicted of spying in favor of the British, and his daughter Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is undergoing a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change of country name.
The referendum was intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighbouring Greece over the country's name, which coincided with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.

International organizations are watching for the preparations for the referendum and the vote today.

Approximately 100 teams traveled around the country to watch the whole process today, from opening polling stations to closing them, then counting votes and drafting protocols.
There have been 10 teams in the country over the course of a month who have been monitoring the preparations for the vote, the media, compliance with the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Fei Doulgeri: About 500 foreign observers are closely watching the voting.
The observer groups shall record in detail the developments and communicate with members of the electoral commissions in order to then present them in the final report.”
The translator compared the thinking of the Russians to that of the Germans
The values of the Russian and German peoples vary, but few differences between them do not play a great role in understanding.
That was the case on International Translator Day, on 30 September, when a Synorist translator, Berbel Sacks, spoke about it.
It has been involved in the translation of Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events in a calm manner, "and the Russians, as the saying goes, "will be a long time till they move fast."
But I don't think it's an important role for understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter,' said the expert in the commentary, "REA News."
According to the interpreter, it is enough to understand that two countries can't do anything without each other: "A knowledge of history is enough."
And in the future, Sackse pointed out, Germany has no point in ignoring Russia.
Russia is the natural part of Europe, and there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, and there are lots of things that determine our common destiny," she said.
The day before, the chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, stated that the country was trying to link and sustain relations with Russia.
According to her, the Berlin Mania project of the North 2 gas pipeline, which is built from the Russian coast to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is particularly important.

By the game, perhaps God helped Siberia today, because he was very rude, especially our leaders.
In fact, the micro game was lost at 0:3 of our leading leaders, so it was hard for us to get that match out, even though there were moments.
But I'll still blame myself.
Because I guess I missed something in the training.
This was a different team compared to the last match."
"It's a thing of the kind."
The audience is outraged by Agustin's choice at Golos's
The audience at the Golos 60+ show is accusing mentor Leonida Agutina of "smoothless connoisseration"
When in the blind hearing, he learned from his first note the voice of his father, Nikolai Agotina, many of them hoping that he would maintain neutrality and not return to the perpetrator.
But sonly feelings took hold, and he chose a relative to his team.
Many then thought it was a joke, but they forgave the mentor of the dysfunction in the first phase.
But the "grap" has been prolonged, and the father of the star has completely unduly taken up the place of more worthy performers.
And now the spectators are not ready to forgive Agotin for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, were outraged by the empty and frank running of our close relatives on the final ladder.
I've even doubted that Agutina doesn't carry enough strength and conscience to the end of his dad until the first place,' reasoned Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin on "Telech TV Humans."
Meanwhile, for his father, Leonid Agutin's "if" wonderful performers who were really singing, while Nicholas Petrovic said a touching song about his mother, explaining that the viewers still want to see his father's show.
But as it turns out, it's not the case, the viewers want an objective assessment, and they want to see really talented performers at the finish, and now Agustin discredited the show.
"I feel sorry for the members of the Golsa from the Agutin team, they were condemned."
"The last time Agutin showed how much he loved Dad, he should have shown himself to be a professional today."
"The contest has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave his dad in the project, not a poet, but a whisper, what can you call a mentor after that?"
"He likes to sing dad, arrange a concert in Kremlin for his money, and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's Golos's show, not the "Blind Relatives".
"On the part of Agustin, it was unprofessional."
"Then, on your own show, you have to propose to the pope, not to the show, which is for the money of the 1 Canal."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took a seat.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad has to make me understand more than any other participant with actual visual data.
Why did a working man from Surguth with a wonderful voice and a warm sludge, while Pope Agutina was brought to the finish?
And then we all complain that on the stage and from the screens of the same people for decades!
Don't go through the crevice."
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
It's bluffing and obscenity.
And money in the family budget will not be too much!
The theatre is going on!"
Likewise, users remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Golsa", the son of the Gradski came out on blind auditions.
Then a meter didn't come into your head to take your son to your own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, everyone's got it."
Agustin will act as a professional.

At the same time, the court in Egypt supported the removal of bearded policemen from service.

In Russia, fines will begin for violations in the area of construction
From tomorrow in Russia, we're going to start fines for violations in the area of construction, and we're going to have a radio 24 channel.
The penalty is against companies and officials if they do not submit house data in time to the Single Housing Information System.
The innovation will help those who have decided to buy an apartment in the building but are afraid of the builder's bankruptcy.
This was discussed at the St. Petersburg Conference for the construction industry.
The amendments to the Law on Long-term Construction will require developers to lend themselves entirely at the bank.
And many experts have already talked about a possible long journey of apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.
In central Kiev, the robber threatened the man with a knife, forcing him to take the money off the bank.
The incident took place on the night of 29 September at Ivan Kudri Street, with the report of capital law enforcement officers.
According to the victim, an unknown man approached him and engaged in a conversation, but then he suddenly pulled a knife and demanded that he give him the money and the mobile phone.
Since the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered that the money be taken from the bank card.
“After the attacker received 4,000 guanos and telephones, he struck the victim and hid himself”, says the report.
The police had been able to detain the robber, resulting in a 25-year-old kyivian.
He is now in danger of being imprisoned for up to seven years.
The police also follow up on the abuser’s version of other such crimes.
Remember, on the eve of Odessa, there have been several radical robberys by inquisitors.
In one case, armed robbers were captured with the help of a drone.
A scientist described a possible scientific programme for the expedition of the Russian Federation to the Moon.
The head of the Institute for Space Research, an correspondent member, Mr. Anatoly Petrukovic, informed RIA News of a possible programme of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was now working on the development of such activities.
"Consolidated opinion is not yet," emphasized a scientist.
He noted that one option was to place a low frequency radar on the other side of the Moon, which would avoid interference from which the Earth was a source.
“This is the only place where a telescope can be deployed to explore space-based radiation sources”, added Petruković.
He also believes that the Moon could be used to test robotics, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, cosmonauts should be involved in the discovery of primitive organs on Earth's satellite, according to a scientist.
This could help to determine how life develops on planets.
Formerly, the head of "Roscosmos" said that in the optimistic version of the Russian Federation could carry out a piloted flight to the Moon by 2030.
A hurt client dropped a basket of fairies at 7-Eleven
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), called "saw teeth" for the manager of a 7-Eleven network store around the clock, in May, he put him out of the store for his indecent behavior.
So I decided to avenge my enemy in an original way.
In the middle of the second night, he entered the store and threw it on the floor and on the parts of the goods on the shelf, the contents of the basket he had brought.
The basket included feces and urine that Simms had "take" from a nearby mobile biotoilet.
The police who arrived at the scene arrested the bridge.
He was put in prison and released on bail for $300.
He was charged with unlawful interference with someone's property and crime, and prohibited from entering the shop and approaching the manager.
Although the crime of Simms is more ridiculous than a serious one, the sentence may be rather harsh, as it has been repeatedly violated by law: theft of large proportions, robbery, illegal possession of arms, car entry in an ill-treatment and animal abuse.

The most formidable enemy submarine for the U.S. fleet will be the Russian submerge of the Yasan-M project, writes The National Interest.
The submarine was launched into water in March 2017, but will be deployed in 2019 by the Navy.
According to the publication, even the predecessor of Kazani, the submersible of Severodwinsk, was commended by the American military.
We're going to face a severe potential enemy.
Just look at Severodwinsk, quoting The National Interest Counter-Admiral of Dave Johnson.
At the same time, the publication states that the United States retains its advantage over Russia.
The multipurpose nuclear submunitions “Cazan”, “Novoshibirsk”, “Crasnoarsk” and “Archangelsk” are based on an improved project called “Yan-M” (885M).
They have a water displacement of 13,800 tons, a diving depth of 520 metres, a crew of 64, a autonomy of 100 days, a underwater speed of 31 knots.
Submarines are armed with mines, torpedoes with 533 mm, Orics winged missiles and Calibre.
In August, in the press service of the 6th US Navy, U.S. Navy declared that the United States submarines remain “the most powerful and frightening force on the planet”.
German politicians ignored the opening of the mosque because of Erdogan.
The Prime Minister of Federal Land, North Rhine - Westphalia Armin Lachet, and Robert Henriett Recker, have ignored the opening ceremony of a new city mosque.
Deutsche Welle writes about this.
President Regep Taip Erdogan of Turkey attended the event.
Lachet met Erdogan at Cologne Airport, but refused to go to the mosque, explaining that the event might have turned into a “a highly politicized event”.
Reker reported having received an informal invitation the day before the opening, on Friday, 28 September.
According to her Spokesperson, such a proposal should be considered too late and not serious.
Speaking on the square before the mosque, Erdogan summarized a two - day visit to Germany.
The President called them successful, he said, and he met President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he discussed, inter alia, the fight against racism and Islamophobia.
The new mosque in Kelin has become one of the largest in Europe, and it has been able to house about 1,000 faithful at the same time.
The construction reached Euro30 million and financing was provided by the Turkish side.
In Ivanov it will be possible to become a diver, a speltologist or an alpenist.

This is what U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said.

I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
The Russian pilot Williams, Sergey Sirotkin, commented on the outcome of the Russian Grand Race.
"Well, honestly, I don't really want to talk about what's in the mind.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I ended up between the two cars that hit me right away.
I lost all the positions that played at the start, the moment, right away.
Turned out in a very bad position.
He's stuck in traffic.
It was hoped that after the others had dropped to the top, we would be in the clear air, and that the pace would come back, but the rubber was gone.
Plus had a fight with his partner, and he was in contact with him too.
I understand he was a little wrong.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most unwary route of season, I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful, honestly.
"I don't want to talk about it anymore," brings the words of the Sirotkin RIA, "The News."
And remember Sirotkin, in a race in the Grand Seas of Russia, performed on the 18th, and the British "Mersedes" pilot Lewis Hamilton was the winner.
Tar Writeev described it as absurd to dispossess Ghovakov and the board from the foundation of Spartacus.
The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTR), Szymil Tarpezev, commented on the exclusion of football players from Moscow’s “Spartacus” Denis Glosovakov and Andrea, as far as the training team was concerned, with the main composition, following the swearing of the principal coach, Massismo Carrera, reports “Sport Weekend”.
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
That kind of thing to look at, that's ridiculous.
I completely disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the discord in the team.
First, these poems, they can be read and understood as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted at all in Carrera's place.
Everyone's got their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to be cool.
If Goszcow and Nashko are being swearing, it doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think an Italian needs flexibility in his perception of the situation.
And that doesn't serve the normal climate in the team.
There's no game of Spartacus today, so the situation hasn't had to be crushed at all.
Maybe it was worth making fun of.
Spartacus has a lot to do with different lines, and there's a lot to do with the addition of young people.
"There seems to be no optimism on the inside of the team," -- I'm sure Tarpeschew.
The two teams will play on 30 September starting at 1900 Moscow time.
John Terry, the previously renouncing Spartacus, led a youth team called Chelsea.
Syrius students discussed with scientists on natural-friendly technologies
Teachers of the Syrius Education Centre in Sochi, participants at the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by researchers at the Quartivian Institute National Research Centre.
The presentation of the researchers was carried out as part of the programme of the Global International Forum on Convergence and Natural Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, on 29 September.
The lecture opened a documentary film entitled “Cody Kurchatovov”, during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, the correspondent member, Mr. Mikhail Kovalchuk, presented global challenges as a driving force for civilization.
A student's lecture is published on Sirius.
Students have learned that modern technology requires a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing these amounts.
This problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will benefit from the natural technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kowalshuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural technologies and also highlighted the risks inherent in the creation of such technologies.
"The coming of such technologies is a unique thing, it's an enormous benefit.
It's an explosive growth of medical technology, it's improving the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's a second side.
The development of natural technologies is in fact the technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There's a side that's hand-held, purpose-oriented intervention in human activity.
There are always risks.
There was a car -- people were dying under the wheels.
But cars use it anyway.
The dual nature of technology right away.
I'm creating new medical technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," cited a scientist, REN TW.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, students were able to ask questions at the meeting.
Speakers were the Physico-Mathematics candidate, the head of the NIBS-Natural Technology Project of the NVIXI, the Kurchanov Institute of Medicine, and the head of the NIBXI technology facility of the Kurchaslaw Demin.
Syrius Education Centre in Sochi has been established by the Talant and Success Education Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure initiated by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the educational centre is to identify, develop and continue professional support for gifted children.
Previously, it was reported in September that the prizers of all-Russian online Olympiad on information security, Cybervasov, would be sent to Sirius for training.

Macedonia: No referendum was held due to a low appearance
The referendum was intended to approve an agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje on the re-name of the Balkan country to North Macedonia.
Greece opposed the use by Macedonians of the name of its historic province.
The name of the country of the former Yugoslav Republic of Yugoslavia is the opening of the way to and from NATO to the EU.
But, according to the EFE agency, only 34 percent of the appearances in the Sunday plebiscite "did not reach" to the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was merely consultative in nature, it might be the decision of the Skopje authorities not to refuse to change.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, a supporter of the change of name of the Republic, stated that if more “yes” were cast, Macedonia would change the name, regardless of the unattained quorum.

Queerowscani had a flock of rams on the cemetery.
On September 30, a well - known Kemrov page on the social network reported that cattle were free to walk on a local cemetery.
Animals from a small herd had gone between the fences and dug out grass.
Commentators expressed different views: some local residents noted that in the presence of small cattle at the cemetery, there was no harm, and their appetite could even help to clear land from weeds and grass, but some residents did not have the behaviour of animals in the city by heart:
"It's graves, not pasture.
There's nothing for the rams to do.
You will not say of the rams, "But it is not the thing."
In one way or another, one witness noted that the problem of animals in the cemetery was already known and the necessary measures would be taken soon.
What's the right thing to do?
Words never existed.
That's right.
The word "squeezing" in the sense of "squeezing, influencing, influencing" is only phonetic, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "long."
We use that word to think it comes from the word “pour”.
But "pour" and "satisfy" not only are they not close, but they are also, in a sense, the opposite.
Make it your own.
The portion (circle-book, obsolete) is "well, complete, enough, to be sufficient for anyone or something to please."
Enjoying, enjoying words of kinship.
He used to have the value of being "no matter what, being self-absorbed" -- "doing himself."
The old Slavic "long" is the word "wire" and "slave".
It's a different way to suppress it.
In these words, truly frightening "borns": daos - "trap" (a widow sheep), deija - "to die" and dvaid - "to try."
The similar phonetic shape of the word “pension” and “long life” as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter led them to join in the issue of authorization.
So we have this very "d" which is also used in writing through "a", which, in a way, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of those words.
Right, right.
But the word is outdated, in its proper sense, out of use.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have negative effects on you from above, use the word “press”.
You can also use the "show pressure" structure, but remember it's an office.

But our car's behavior has been better since the beginning of the weekend."

What's the reason?"
"My attempt was good, but then it turned out to be one of the Mercedes' persecutors."
He was getting ready for the attempt and still was able to miss me, but I think I've lost some time in it.
But it doesn't seem to have had a lot of effect on the result."
"In Sochi, it's very hard to chase, the race's going to be a key moment?"
"Please, yes, but you never know how it's going to happen.
It's not going to be easy anyway, because our car's a little bit slower than Mercedes."

Russia has protected itself from terrorists by means of an operation in Syria
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 were killed by the FM air and space forces.
This was reported on the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the FAC, the head of the Council of the Federation for Defence and Security, Victor Bundaev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-to-air means: the air-space forces have carried out and continue to impact all attacks precisely on terrorist targets.
According to Bondavere, in three years tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria, such as ammunition warehouses, reinforcements and headquarters.
With the help of Russian aircraft, a Jihadist defense was broken, which became a decisive contribution to the march of Syrian government troops, transmitting the Interfax.
At the same time, according to Bondave, our Syrian military operation has also protected Russia from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the Syrian operation, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IG, prohibited in Russia) and Jabhat en Nosru (prohibited in Russia).
According to Gentab, the FAF, on the side of the IG, had some four thousand Russian militants and about 5,000 citizens of the post-Soviet countries, passing over the TTSS.
This is only a matter of recorded characters, apart from those who have not been identified, emphasized Bondaves.
Most of them have been trained and are ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports have given them the right to enter our territory freely.
So, said Bondaev, in Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism on far-off -- otherwise, it's an evil "would have appealed to us."

Mitropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev’s decision to rename UPCs with Fascists
The head of the Sydodical Division of External Religious Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church compared the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Fascists against the Jews.
"It's like in German Fascist Germany to stick a yellow-circuit star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it's for that purpose that this bill was created," said a micropolitic on the television channel "Russia-24."
In his view, this step would have the most serious consequences right now that the Russian-Ukrainen conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UPC and to “make it out of the law”, believes the priest.
“This is a Ukrainian church, and the believers in this church consider themselves to be Ukrainians; they are the patriots of their country,” he added.
It has been known earlier that the Supreme Council has been working on the implementation of Bills No. 4128 (resubordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (Special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (rename of religious organizations).
The latter means that the PCP is renamed a Moscow patriarchate.
Mr. Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Mr. Vladimir, Deputy of the Holy-Uspen Postchaev Publice, issued an appeal for the defence of Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to believers in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (PRC) was published on Saturday on the site of the residents.
At various times in the history of our predecessors and relatives, Christians had to practice their faith and defend their saints.
Given the situation and the information we have and the threats of the massacres that are spreading, we can see that we will have to survive," said Mitropolitan.
He asked for support, prayer, moral.
Also, the laurra principal emphasized that perhaps “your physical presence would be a delight”.
The minister added, "In the spirit, Lenin's grandchildren are in danger of being executed, and then to defend their sanctuary."
Those who are not indifferent to the fate of Pochaevsky’s laurel, the Orthodox sanctuary of Ukraine and the universal sanctuary, must be prepared to protect it, and speak of the treatment.
The Mitropolitan called for no harm to those who mislead the believers.
UPC has a canonical status, determined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to be made dependent on the news patriarch and a friend of the Catholic pope of Rome's Bartholomew.
A new style, with its consequences, is not open to us from the outset.
And we're happy with the status that our church has," said the laurel's assistant.
He recalled that the UPC has since October 1990 been canonically independent and entirely independent in its administration.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow patriarchy.
Tomos actually has our church.
'What about Tomos do we need?' said the Mitropolitan Pochai Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether there are other Tomos denominations, are they independent of the Vatican?
Those who believe in some way have disassembled and determined the temple to which they are going.
But someone wants to spread hostility and discord again.
"Some have promised to be jealous of sowing domes on temples that they want to destroy," said the priest.
The Pavavian lavre is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
It is located at the top of the Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometres from the Ternopolis.
Its first historical record dates back to the early 13th century.

The dramatic deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September was reported in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with Iran, China, India, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrève.
In fact, in Afghan territory, fighters have unleashed the present terrorist war against the State authorities and the peace population of the country.
The current year is a record year of blood attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” noted Patsev.
The scourges of Afghanistan did not begin yesterday.
Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the main enemy of the United States was the Al-Qaida terrorist group (banned by the Russian Federation) settled in Afghanistan.
Within a month, America and NATO allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom there.

And peaceful life is even more beautiful than it was then.
The United States troops have been caught off guard for tens of their bases.
How can they be redeemed from fighters for money, only to avoid touching them?
The Government of Afghanistan controls the smaller part of the country, which is 40 per cent, according to Patrosev.
50% in the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
10 per cent for ISIS terrorists (no longer in the Russian Federation).
But they're growing there fast.

The Macedonians are ready to vote in the referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change of country name.

Lupko Petkowski, a political scientist: "The good news of this agreement in Macedonia or North Macedonia is given the right to a better future, the hope of social change.
And Greece will establish its right to the past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that are unable to make everyone happy.”
The name of the country is the ruling social democrats, headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against the conservative opposition and President George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilemanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev has been imposed from outside to change the country ' s name.
That decision, however, would have negative consequences.
First of all, I will lose my sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the greatest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crucifixion.
The choice that citizens of Macedonia will make will determine not only the Balkans but Europe as a whole.”
