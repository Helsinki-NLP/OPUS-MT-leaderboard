In my view, the literature programme was designed by the ladies of Balzakov, on the basis of their interests.
Of the 19th century's Russian literature, we preferred Danilsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote a leletist, of course, in terms of the same Balsakovian age.
And psychology and torture of Tolstoy and Turgenova for adolescents are not so interesting.
Teens are rarely interested in hero psychology.
Thank you so much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige Mats 105x195.
Model "Practice Prestige", comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different rigidity of the sides: the average to hard surface is formed of a latexed coconut and a natural latex, a moderately soft plate of natural latex.
The crosshouse from 1,000 spring to square metre is rapidly adapted to the body of the asleep, warning effect of the “volunt” or “gamac”.
There is a need for breathing materials to be identified among the benefits of the model.
The gas perforated for airtightness is perfectly vented naturally, as is the coconut collar.
As a result, there is a healthy microclimate of the bedroom.
An extended guarantee period is also extended to the mattress.
The length of the official guarantee from the manufacturer is five years, for the period of service of the mattress.
The protection against dust and contamination is entrusted to a de-alerted drawer from a juckard in the kit.
Get an orthopedic pillow in a couple of times, and it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.

Germany: Fourth vaccination from the coroner is inevitable
Fourth vaccination will take place during the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany would not be final, but would continue with new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of coronavior vaccine would probably not be enough to provide full protection.
The head of the Association of Doctors of General Practice, Ulrich Weigldt, is convinced.
This is what Die Wellt reports on Saturday, 11 December.
“We expect the fourth vaccination to take place in summer, at the latest in autumn”, the expert said.
In addition, Wyheldt hopes that the fourth vaccine from the coronavior may be carried out “in combination with the influenza vaccine”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help combat the spread of the new strain of the coroner, OmiCron.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
So, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than with Delta or beta strains.
This is reflected in the results of a preliminary study carried out in South Africa.
On this basis, the producers of BioNTech / Pfizer are planning to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
Companies stress that the two doses of vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against contamination by the new version of Omicron coroner.
BioTech and Pfizer studies showed that at two doses of vaccine efficiency is significantly lower: “netra-integration capacity is cut by more than 25 times”.
“This indicates that two BNT162b2 doses do not provide sufficient protection against the contamination of omegron stimuli”, emphasized BioNTech and Pfizer.
So a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Zulberger, President of the German Infectious Diseases Society, is in favour of reducing the interval between second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Ulberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicranta coronavirus.
"The Israeli experience demonstrates this very convincingly," the expert said.
Portoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch from Potoon21®.
It is different (like the Kalikana Vib series) from the many other products originally designed to be used for icefish and not just for harvesting the plant.
These vibrations have more than close-ups, a specific weight, which certainly has a positive effect on the nuances of these interesting baits.
Another characteristic that is recognized is the upper flipper of a hard and hard-plate plate, which creates additional vibrations in vertical and horizontal wires.
A fairly aggressive game is shown as a "immediate Witch" when caught at the Bet-A-Vib.
The most catchy is often a simple monotonous animation, which is the movement up and down with almost no payload.
In planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient for fishing in a limited area covered by underwater vegetation, roots and other obstacles for which the trailer can be engaged.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant during the fishing of the winter boat and the large window, especially in the middle of the winter when a precise and aggressive bait is required.
When reaching the extreme point of the trajectories, the Bet-A-Vib is instantly turned around and returned to the reference vertical.
At least successfully, Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter fishing for pond trouts.
In order to please her capriciouss, you can select from two modifications: noise pod (NS - NanoSond) or without her (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib is capable of diluting a passive hole that does not even respond to the belly.
When caught, Bet-A-Vib shows the range and accuracy.
It's understood and not capricious, and it's very well combined with the stork and the wires of even the larger diameters.
In order to catch the injection of the rats, the boat, the urchin, or the window, except for the uniform relevance of the feet, sometimes with the "bright" on the bottom.
If you're caught in locked places, you can switch the front triangle into a double, which reduces the probability of a hitch.
Among its classes, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most sustainable and, consequently, one of the most catchy.
With the same success, relatively small and relatively deep areas can be used.
All models are equipped with Ower ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, approximately 7,000 Russian mercenaries claimed
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PAQ) of Wagner in Libya.
On Sunday, December 12, the President of the High Council of State of the Republic, Khaled al-Misri.
“There are currently more than 7,000 PACK “Wagner” mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also grow trenches in Sirte and Kufre.
They have 30 jets on the Gardabiya aircraft (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) " , using the words of Andolu.
Khaled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries “try to take over” the central part of Libya extending from Chad to the Mediterranean, after “to bring their people to power” in the Central African Republic.
& Keep presence
In the opinion of the interlocutor, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and to remain “in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and the port of Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufre, as well as the agency's publication.
The Russian authorities formally deny that Wagner CAC is supported by the Kremlin.
Where could you still be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is expected to operate in nine countries in Africa, Central Africa, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner ' s subsidiary enterprises receive certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of arms, technologies and military services to those countries, as stated in the article.
According to the media, the "vanners" were allegedly fought in Donbasa, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the Central African region.
The group is not in the security forces or in the police register, and the combatants are not on the uniform personnel lists.
This company is subject to U.S. sanctions.
Remember, the 27 EU countries previously approved the reaction against Wagner.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The High State Council of Libya de facto is the second House of Parliament, with advisory functions with its dominant Islamists, writing to the TCSS.
This body has repeatedly called for the suspension of a single day of voting on the election of members of Parliament and Head of State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
"It's less than two weeks before the election, and there's a sudden decline in the chances that they'll pass in time," says the material.
Against this background, the High Electoral Commission of Libya has postponed the announcement of a final list of candidates indefinitely and has handed over the Sky News Arabia television channel.
Foreign policy with the eyes of the Russians
Thirty-eight per cent of Russians see the country's foreign policy as more successful than failure, and 29 per cent think it's failure.
"Practices of success - "in Syria protected, restored peace there," "Northern Flow 2," "the whole world was threatened by the awesome armament," "Crime us."
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “integration from peace”, as stated in the Foundation's study of “Public Opinion”.
The Dubaya Government totally abandoned paper business - all of the public services have also become digital.
The Government of Dubai reported a total phase-out of paper files and a transition to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively electronically to the population.
The Emirth News Agency WAM reports this.
“The day has marked the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life — we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government”, stated the Crown Prince Emirata, President of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktum on Saturday.
The internal and external flow of documentation in all institutions of Dubai will now be implemented only in digital form through specialized information platforms.
The innovation affected everything without exclusion from the industry: health care, JCH, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the initiative of the Government.
The transition to the electronic Government and the digitalization of documentation began in Dubai from 2018 onwards.
During that time, the authorities estimated that 336 million paper sheets had been saved, representing 14 million hours of human work and $353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Previously, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobian stated that electronic services would save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, the date of birth and how many years a child it's already a frost, about a class and a group in a nursery, too.

Those people knew exactly that there was someone at home...
Turkey ' s vehicle production and exports fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's vehicle production and exports declined sharply in November against the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the 11-month industrial performance has been worse, reports Bloomberg, referring to data from the Association of Turkish Road Manufacturers.
According to the association, 115,000 vehicles were fired in November in Turkey, 20 per cent less than the previous year.
Some 79,000 vehicles were sent to export, more than 25% of them falling to last year ' s show.
And while Turkey ' s car sector has shown positive momentum by the first 10 months of this year, it was already 0.3 per cent worse after 11 months of 2021.
The fall was caused by a sharp decline in the Turkish lira, which cost 29 per cent of its dollar in November.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 BMS entities received deferred credit payments in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, reported on the situation of small and medium-sized business benefits, transmitting an IIA correspondent, Kazinform.
“As reported by the Financial Marketing and Regulation Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year Alyhan Smail, in response to a request from the Head of State dated 1 April 2021, issued Order No. 127 of the President of the Agency dated 9 April 2021 concerning the approval of the procedure for the granting of deferred payments on loans from small and medium-sized enterprises”, wrote to Alikh Smail in response to a parliamentary request.
He recalled that the time-limits arrangements for loans were for banks and organizations engaged in microfinancial activities to delay payments on loans issued before 1 April 2021 to IPM entities, including IPMs, for the period from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The deferral period was between 30 and 90 days at the choice of the IMS entity.
The borrower ' s application could have indicated a different period of deferment of payments.
During the stay period the borrower was suspended, the claim for work, the notice of the need to settle the arrears, and the creditor's charges of the commissions and other payments,” noted the Zambezier.
In 2021, the second-tier banks received applications for a stay of 603 loans from the ISB, of which 553 ISB entities were deferred in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
In IFIs, an application for a stay of 131 ISB entities, of which 95 entities, worth 105.8 million tenge, has been deferred,” concluded A. Smail.
Pulmonologist Puresev suggested that people with weak immunity could easily carry the strain of omyron.
The doctor suggested that those with reduced immunity could be more able to endure it than those with a strong protective response from the body.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puresev explained why the strain of the coroner's ommonus could be dangerous.
The reason is to look for the virus in its wake.
Scientists believe that the omyron was born in the body of an infected or suffering immunodeficiency virus.
I mean, when he was mutiny, he didn't face any resistance to immunity.
That's why he's more aggressive.
The fact that there was no answer to immunity made him very quick.
Apparently he's got these spicy proteins there, his spikes maybe more than they've laid, their antibodies have not been cut during the mutations, and comments pulmonologist Sergey Puresev.
The doctor suggested that those with reduced immunity could carry “optimone” more easily than those with a strong protective response from the body.
Turns out, the body's strong response to something, to any infection, isn't always good.
In such cases the body can kill itself.
So that's what happens in pneumocoma infections when young people are 30 years old, and the old people, 60-year-olds, they carry it.
The imperceptible response of the young man is totally inadequate: where only a finger could be threatened, he beats like a gun in a camel, and concluded Sergei Puresev.
The doctor also recalled that the coroner has dangerous side effects and that the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Light inflammation is bacterial and viral.
If the first one is treated very successfully and quickly, the second one is often only able to buy the symptoms - the whole hope of the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the start of intoxication of the body -- temperature, weakness, weakness.
Then there are respiratory symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, throatization, cough.
The pain on the right or on the left, the aubminal pain, can also indicate a growing problem.
Meanwhile, a growing generation between the ages of 12 and 18 may start vaccination by the end of the year.
A virus specialist, the head of the MFTI genetic engineering laboratory, Paul Volchkov, noted that he suffers from a goat’s disease.
For teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is as high as possible.
It's the most prolific social media, like gardeners, says Moscow 24, Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, the head of the IFTI genetic engineering laboratory.
Great thanks to the author for this article.
It was a pleasure to refresh my memory.

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity are the victims of coconuts
The authors examined the fat left of the bariatric operations and found that fat cells known as aidopocytes could be infected with the coronary.
The immune cells in the fatty tissue, macrophages, were also infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists have also examined the fat tissue of patients who died from a goat and discovered coroner’s particles in fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can be hidden in fat tissue using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid the response of the immune system.
Probably the SARS-Cov-2 could do that.
Biologist described the causes of dementia
The candidate for biological science, Simeon Gotoshikin, identified the causes of the dementia and described how it could be prevented in an interview with Pputnik.
According to WHO, over 55 million people suffer from the disease.
Syndromes show a gradual loss of cognitive functions — a person may find it difficult to concentrate even in a familiar setting over time.
Goloshakin noted that dementia is most often caused by neurogenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disturbances and a lack of vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of illness.
It includes hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social exclusion and lack of active co-ordination may be involved,” he said.
Dementia is also affected by harmful habits, such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and low - speed lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and reduce abstract thinking.
"There's a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it," added a biologist.
To prevent the occurrence of a disease, WHO recommends that the required level of fiducation be maintained, and that cognition skills and skills that require memory and logic be trained.
Formerly a professor of the department of neuroscience, neurosurgery and medical genetics of FGOS, U.S.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the cognitive disturbance department of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnics, Anna Bogoletov, described the reasons for the memory problems.
Egypt returned some 30,000 illegal artefacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has succeeded in returning some 30,000 artefacts that have been smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, on the television channel Al-Hayat, the Chief Inspector of the Department of backed Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Ancient Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has returned 29,300 artefacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were found in the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C. alone,” he said.
Abdel Gauad explained that all smuggling by means of artifacts were registered in the archives.
Department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, “track auctions around the world and Internet sales” via foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that upon return, cultural property was restored and then displayed in museums.
He said that one of the returned artefacts had been discovered in Belgium by an ancient skeleton of a man who is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find out what had been sold at the auction in London by Pharaoh Tutanghamon.
The Christtiie's auction house held a bidding on 4 July at which the barbes over 3,000 years old were sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This brought frustration on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed from the Karnaks temple in Luxembourg in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanghamon, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, had been kept in a private collection and had not been present in the marketplace since 1985.
How the relics came to be in Europe is not known.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking to repatriate illegally removed from the country at different times of ancient monuments.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the smuggling of ancients is the result of archaeological research of “black copyers”.
“The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account” — and that is true, as Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a people of self (nearly to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people live in Crimeu (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and their name is two words!
Only a Turkic language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to staff members ' personal mobile devices
Credit Susse requires his staff to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writing Financial Times.
In Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not provide corporate telecommunications devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner, telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, the bank may examine information on corporate devices issued to its employees because they are used to deal with business issues with counterparts or clients.
The bank has the right to verify mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if a staff member has used them for a meeting with a client that has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved to remote service, the bank wants to extend this rule to all the devices that have been used to deal with business issues.
According to the newspaper, the Bank ' s management has set a deadline for staff to consult the new rule.
The information on the new requirement is not officially commented on in Credit Suisse.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Esenin, 1925, has been fruitful in creation, but the toughest poet and his "he" poet to live on earth.
He's already out of any literary associations, he's disintegrated, he's in his own way, but he's known, he's demanded, at times he's strongly critical, even vicious, but the reader's ready to carry him in his arms.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them real masterpieces, completed the "Persian Motives" cycle, written by the Enna Snegina poem, published by 8 books, the book The Church of the Soviets.
And the main success is that at the end of June of the 25th year, the State Member concluded a contract with Esenin to publish his works in volumes three.
None of the modern Sergey Alexanderic poets have enjoyed such honor, he's the first!
In addition, it has been a very good sum of money - a contract fee of 1,000 roubles per month for 20 months (the factory director, for example, received 300 roubles per month and an engineer 200).
Funds that year were needed more than ever.
Esenin married Lvo Tolstoy Sofie Tolstoy's grandson, and she had to study her family's household, support her sisters Katya and Sashu, and her mother.
Life would seem to be getting better, there's something to rejoice about, but for him everything is mostly in dark tone, as if a nightmare from the Black Man poem (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where the pain came from.
Will the wind whistle?
Above an empty and desolate field,
It's like growing up in September,
I've got alcohol in my brain.
Many people have noted that Esenin had gone down a lot, that he didn't look well, obviously sick.
More and more revelries, nerve breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just about alcoholism.
Well, if this diagnosis is alcoholism -- Sergey Alexandrovich someone did, there's no reliable evidence left.
Let's say, in my case in 1923, when Esenin stands for his fourth wife, American Aidor Duncan, was receiving health care at a Paris clinic from Professor Peter Hannuškina (a new woman, two years later, in Moscow).
And here are the evidences of poets, of scandals in the soil, of police transmissions in the most limited way -- of tens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20's, a terrible poet's novel with a green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Essen took up his brief stay with a friend who was impudent to John the Stark.
Amazingly, Essenin never had his own house in Moscow or in Peter with his very good incomes, but he got into rented apartments, hotels, or acquaintances.
Old people remember:
“It is only nighttime, and in most cases in an inexorable, drunken state.
One day, back at four o'clock in the morning, Esenin fell on a staircase...
Falling down, he's on his face and bawl.
When he was wearing himself a little, he began coughing all the time, screeching all the blood...
And Esenin himself, after a European and U.S. soldier, (in the U.S., was a dry law, but Duncan took with him a proper drinker) said,
"I didn't see anything there except the cabs and the streets...
I stopped by the end and people stopped remembering...
And the dust, of course...
I'm drinking because I'm too fat."

Matras Promex Oriente Duet Latex Econom 100x1995
The Promtex Oriente Duet Latex Econom is the modern execution of the budget model in the line of the premium class.
The base of the mattress is the block of independent double spring Duet.
Large spring inlet inserts a lighter small spring.
This makes it possible to distribute evenly the load on the mattress.
On either side of the mattress is a man-made latex.
It's the equivalent of a natural latex, but it's denser and less expensive.
This material’s sympathy and composting ability improves the mattress’s comfortable effect.
It doesn't absorb moisture and dust.
Matras will be a good match with a big difference in weight (of 30 kilograms).
The “smart” spring does not have a wave effect here when a light partner is jumping to the side of the heavy.
A nice, soft-to-skin huskle from a practical sinsense jacket is going through a layer of synthetic.
Natural tissue does not accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to make this model of mattress in a narrow version (vacuum roll-pack).
He's almost 16, and he hasn't been fooled for a long time.
All energy aims at choosing what it will earn for itself.
He's much more responsible than I was when I was his age or my husband, who had some problems with the law before the wedding.
Father cares about his young daughter.
And likes to, as Lemont wrote, "country love."
Why did the girl cry at the exam before she failed it?
Why didn't he tell her it's not school.
She'll have a tail.
So what?
He'll transfer.
Millions of students know that.
What are you talking about?
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as weapons against the EU
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as weapons.
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Paul Jabonsky, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as weapons against the European Union and intended to return to such “operation” next year.
This statement was made by the head of the Ministry in an interview with Australia’s Financial Review.
According to Jablon, sanctions against Belarus temporarily “has been suspended by Lukashenka”, but it is “involved in the search for new routes”.
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As reported on kp.ru, the European Union had previously introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It concerned 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, there has been a willingness to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic, “unless the situation in the country improves”.
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide list of products from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by Snowy hat," when a barbed jacket makes a joke out of a man
At secular events, 2021 was dominated by baroque jackets.
Perhaps the first person to claim his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September at the "Not time to die" press film, he appeared in a barbed robin jacket and a traditional "Bondida" grandmother.
He was followed twice by Prince William, who first had at the Eartshot Preize ceremony a non-conforming green black jacket, and then chose a more classic option to support the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was also applied to Lyonel Messiah.
A football player came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in a Dolce & Gaban's barbed jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same manner.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for barbarous male jackets in Russia.
According to the analysts at Gasat.Ru, they were bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular warm jackets are silhouetted and attached silhouettes, the main colors being dark-cut, rold, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between three and 6,000 roubles, while men prefer to buy only jackets, and they choose less often.
You can buy them from not only online rhetoricaries.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In almost all brands - and Brinia, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent - are represented in the barkhat segment of the balks in this season.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, which came out on one of the film's premier "House Gucsi" by the ambassador branded Jared Leto.
When choosing to choose to wear expensive stamps, you can be sure that the barracks are made of silk.
Special protein interpolating technology is used to produce dense tissue with voracious outer textures and smooth interiors.
More budgetary options are made of cotton or polyamides, but are therefore less.
The young expert, Lamoda Ilya Wahoshkin, warns that in the case of a barbed jacket, the main thing is not his model or the fasson, but the appropriateness.
"Barhat requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you meet for a party or a celebration," explains Wahoshkin.
Another important criterion that is allowed to make choices in favour of the jacket is the buyer ' s status.
"A man in a barbed jacket, first of all, has to get the right moving hangover with abundance," they think of the Telegram model "Bramwell's Craft."
They are simply invited to part-time secular events, which always include the Dress Code.
Ilya Wahoshkin proposes a combination of jackets with the same prolific things: classic trousers with arrows, single-tone shirts, silk ties, ankles with bones, shorts.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
The first experts from the Brammel Man are sure that it would be inappropriate to appear in the barbed jacket of a straight worker at the corporation, but that's what he's talking about.
If a employee lowers his or her rank and seeks to make progress in the company’s complex hierarchy or to beat out the financial bonuss, he is better off not to wear a barbed jacket.
Management definitely appreciates the phrase "no blue hat" - they think the editors of Telegram about men's fashion.
There's a very mixed sense of voice.
It's an unnatural turret, so worn out.
And it's not associated at all with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart I desire good luck in life.
It's all about money -- alternative energy's getting a good lobby, so it's paid off.
Billions of investment.
Have they grieved?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy is also not in the gas and oil, and coal was bought cheaper than it is now sold.
There's a wild demand for fuel.
A cop drops it.
Then who's in the flight?
As usual, a private buyer.
Do the Indian problems touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who are asking for energy crises.
They've done their job.
It's a good nose.
I didn't see any beautiful people on the pictures in the article.
It's just the directness of the middle-statist passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it on the whole car, they're not going to fit into it, most likely.
But it's only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "grazers", but certainly not because of their physical appearance.
Kazbek, a slave who is aware of his slave position and who fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who is not aware of his slavery and who glorifies his silence, his ignoranceless and unprovoked slave life is simply a slave.
A slave whose saloons flow when he savorly describes the beauty of the slave's life and admires the good and good lord, and eats cholera, ham."
Immunologist stated that a four- to five-month recovery would help protect against the strain of the coroner's " memikron " .
Four to five months from now, re-licensing can protect against the new strain of the coroner's “micron” infection.
This was made by immunologist Nikolai Kruchkov, who called vaccination after six months, given the emergence of a new strain, a "very big period."
“That was the normal period in the old strains, but now it's best to do the procedure in five months, and people with chronic diseases in four months,” the expert said, calling in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to perform revasion.
Krugchkov also noted that early reacculation provided good tit threes of neutralizing antitels.
"If a man has two vaccinations and a busher, or has been infused and vaccinated, or vaccinated and beaten, he has received "hybrid immunity," that is, an antitel is many and neutralizing enough," the expert explained.
The Big Seven warned Russia of “scaled consequences” in the case of an invasion of Ukraine
The Group of Seven countries (United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States) issued a statement following the meeting of heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have tremendous consequences and will be costly” in Moscow, but does not describe specific measures in the document.
“We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's increasing military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine”, states the statement.
The Ministers further urge Russia “to ease escalation, to use diplomatic channels and to comply with its international obligations with regard to transparency in military activities”, as President Baiden of the United States of America spoke during the video call to President RF Putin on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Jordanian format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in the east of Ukraine”, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of Seven also state.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in response”, they caution.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome the reserved position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” also stated in the statement.
Earlier in the day, Elizabeth Trass, head of British diplomacy, stated that Russia would be subjected to “serious consequences” in the case of an invasion of Ukraine.
She said that the meeting showed “the single voice of the G-7 countries, which accounted for 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that Ukraine's invasion would have tremendous consequences for Russia”.
Pfizer vaccin found it 32 times less effective than omicremma.
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron-stroma coronavirus is 32 times lower than that of the rest of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong, transmitting a message from South China Morning Post (SCMP).
Vaccination was considered less effective on the basis of a study of anti-virus activity among citizens who had received two doses of COVID-19.
“We see that most people have a high level of anti-virus activity against the original version of Sarah-Cov-2, but this capability has been significantly reduced against omicronic variety”, said Professor Malik Peyris.
Scientists, however, stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe current of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Previously, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic in view of its impact on the omicronic stem.
The research concluded that the omicron-stamps could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality unless additional measures were taken.
The head of Ukraine ' s Minoban accused the FAR of blocking NATO arms transfers to Kiev
The Head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of the former FWG Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of Kiev's deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany placed a veto on the purchase of Ukraine’s opposing systems and rifles for drones.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened its position on rifles by recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above weapons in bilateral agreements with allies.
These include the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
FT notes, however, that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholtz regarding the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany, Andrey Melick, expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to supply arms to the Chancellor of Scholc.
He said that the previous FWG leadership had explained its refusal to provide arms to risk the military escalation of the conflict in Donbasa, despite “the occupation by Russia” of parts of Ukrainian territory.
The same “illogical” position, a diplomat's confidence, Germany will remain with the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Greensky stated that Kiev was waiting for assistance from Berlin to equip the Navy.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany “will be Ukraine's technical partner”, added the President.
It was also noted that the Co-Chair of the Green Party, FWG Robert Habeck, had visited the Republic in the spring to promote the sale of defence weapons in Kiev.

Discovered ways to recover stolen money via the Internet
There are several ways to recover money stolen through the Internet and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were disclosed by information security experts in an interview with the RBC.
For example, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when bank cards are entered into the hands of abusers, it is recommended that the funds be stored in a map or bank account that are not used online.
A portion of the savings can be deferred to the savings account and output as necessary.
The experts also recommend setting up a separate online shopping map.
If the money was stolen from purchases in shops that do not use a 3D security security defence technology, a recovery procedure may be initiated.
“In the framework of rules established by payment systems on unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Security, liability shall be placed on the participant in the calculation chain, who does not use the service,” specified the representative of Promsputbank.
An expert from the international payment provider, Ecompy Arthur Zaremba, emphasized that the buyer had the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraud operation not later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used the map on online resources that do not require dual-factor authorization, transactions can be countered and returned.
It is noted that, in some cases, Internet baskets are returning to the client themselves if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Security Internet League, Ekaterine Misulin, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud were received, ranging from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
She said that a single complaint window for online fraud could be an effective solution in the current circumstances.
Scholtz has arrived in Poland to discuss “North Flow-2” and EU legislation
The newly elected chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholtz, arrived in Warsaw to negotiate a crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the growth of Russian troops outside Ukraine's borders and the situation of the Russian gas pipeline, North Falcon II.
Although Scholtz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years, the leaders of the two countries expressed their unequivocal expectations.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateus Moravecki, stated that he would encourage Scholtz to speak against “Northern Flow-2”, which was expected to bring Russian gas to Germany by way of Ukraine.
According to Moravsky, Russia can use gas pipelines against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported the efforts of Poland to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the controversy.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms of the right party “Right and justice” violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay a fine and its supreme court ruled that national legislation took precedence over EU regulations.
The new Government of Germany, sworn on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not make public commitments to stop the work of the North Flow-2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of the Congress that they had come to understand with Germany that a gas pipeline had been stopped if Russia invaded Ukraine, and a high - ranking official of the United States Congress had reported on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholtz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the G-7.

The Ministry wants to give writers residences.
The State will transfer the federal property remaining from the Union of Soviet Writers and the USSR Litters Fund to the future of the Russian Liters Fund.
It will have written residences established, and reported to the “Parliamentary Gazette” in Minsk, which will form the foundation of the fund.

Money found in the church's plumber wall will pay $20,000
Santechnicus, who found money in a church wall in the U.S. state of Texas, will pay the reward.
This is reported in a press release from a non-profit organization, Crime Stoppers of Houston.
An incident occurred at Lakewood’s major evangelical church, where pastor Joel Ostin preachs that God - fearing Christians are looking forward to wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, Justin Kouli's plumber repaired one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of bags of money and checks under insulation.
He passed on the discovery of the church and, he said, did not receive any thanks from Ostin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you've done and what could have done," quotes KPRC-TV.
Apparently, the find was linked to the theft that took place in Lakewood seven years ago.
Some $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques kept in the church safe were then lost.
The money was insured, so the church did not lose.
Nevertheless, information about the criminals included a $25,000 reward.
Justin Kouli could not claim this amount because the reward has expired.
Despite this, a nonprofit organization called Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at the time offered five thousand dollars and later received 20,000 dollars as a gift from the Church of Lakewood, decided to reward the integrity of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
It was reported earlier that the police had questioned Pastor Joel Ostina about the money found in the Leykwood Church.

Citizens with vaccinations have been exempt from issuing a certificate.
The list of exceptions also includes those who have arrived from countries where no vaccine has been proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, Pre-Criminal, Carnivorous Party and other events, which suggest an increase in the tour”, Barrosa noted.
In the past, the Brazilian authorities imposed a five - day quarantine sentence on the invertebrates of the coronaviral tourist infection.
Open-up complete protection scheme from COVID-19
A virologist, a doctor of medical science, a well - deserved Russian scientist, Anatoly Altstein, interviewed Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of complete protection against coronavirus.
He said that this could be achieved through injection and on-the-job vaccine.
Internal use produces a large number of immunoglobulin A. When introducing a vaccine, no injection takes place.
Immunobulins A protect the muscular shell, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside of the vaccination, we're the most likely to have immunoglobulins G (antitel).
And if you inject both vaccines, you'll get lots of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's no decision to double vaccinations yet," the doctors said.
The chief prophylacticist, UrFO, doctor of medical science, Sergey Tokavère, in turn, stated that the main advantage of the use of visual vaccination in combination with injection was the ability to cease being a COVID-19 carrier.
He added that this would help to ensure that the body ' s protection was expected to become maximum.
David Melik Gusseynov, a health minister at the lower town district, said that a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to a new coronaviral infection among children.
He said that this was the case in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic had arrived earlier.

In Europe, mass protests by vaccinated opponents continue
In the Austrian capital city of Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators were sent to the streets.
They expressed their dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make the vaccination against goat compulsory.
As of February of next year, poor people will have to pay a fine of Euro3,600.
Spaniards, outraged by the health-care policies of the authorities, conducted a peace march in Madrid.
Some held posters with "It's a false pandemic," "I won't vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, a co-certificate is compulsory for access to bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, homes of the elderly and night entertainment facilities.
The introduction of health passports by authorities in several regions of the country has led to an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus contamination.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand manifestans have protested the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The attack began peacefully, but then it turned into a clash with the police.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.

WHO has discovered a “micron” in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the new strain of coroner coroner “omikron” has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain can have disastrous consequences.
The rate of strain is reported in a WHO report.
As of 9 December, the organization has identified 63 countries, all six WHO regions.
This, with its active dissemination only from the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of expansion of the new coronaurius version.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain on the preliminary data can bypass the spread of the “delta” strain, but it is an Indian version of the coronaurus, which now runs in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Teds Adhan Hebreeusus, stated that omicron stimulant can have a significant impact on the progress of the coroneraurus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the “michron” will expel the “delta” in the coming months.
And the number of people ill in Britain alone would be about 1 million, with at present several hundred people suffering from the official amopon and estimated up to 10,000 people.
British experts are predicting tens of thousands of deaths from the atom “micron” and at the top of the hospital, they will carry more than 2,000 people daily.
That the British health system won't be able to deal with.
The difficulty is that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech vs. the state of amikron is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
How Russian Satellite V reacts to the “micron” until we know it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gammaley Center had just started testing a Russian vaccine at the "mykron" strain.

Russia warned of a new scheme of frauds
They started looking for new computer fraud maneuvers.
This is described as “Isolation” with reference to experts.
According to the Director of Products, Ivideon Zara Abutalimov, dipphytes are the main danger posed by the distribution of video communications.
In this case, the fraudsters are making a fairy video based on the actual records with the victim.
As a result, neuroscientism has been able to accurately reproduce the behavior of a person.
Abutalimov added that using dipphyk could call familiar victims by video link or create copies of a person to send for blackmail.
"Such falsifications can easily trigger buling, as a subordinate can put people in unscathed, dangerous, or compromising pseudonets," the expert said.
The leading system engineer, Varonis Alexander Wetcol, in turn, pointed out that psychological people have more confidence in others when they see them.
He stressed that this could pose specific risks in the case of video technologies.

Five actions have been listed to help avoid diabetes.
Blood sugar problems are among the most common in the world.
Some, however, do not attach much importance to it or to what is wrong.
In time, diabetes can lead to serious complications, even death.
Preventive activities play a major role in preventing disease.
Doctors, for example, recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of different drinks and drinking water - have a positive effect on metabolicism.
The sugar in the blood increases to a dangerous level when used in excess quantities.
So the first step on the road to healthy living is to stop buying sweets and keeping them home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by poor nutrition but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, a lot of move is needed.
Specialists recommend keeping low-carbon diets.
Such diets will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
Many cages are needed to protect against diabetes.

Dr. Paula told us about the workaholics' "Migines of the weekend"
Several factors may lead to a deterioration in the sense of identity in the weekend
The deterioration of self-esteem after work-buildings is often a “done-day migration”, told a well-known medical doctor, a medical candidate, a senior scientist in the Faculty of Basic Medicine of IYU, and Zuchra Paul's medical director in her own television channel.
She said that it is particularly common for labour - workers who experience headaches, breakdown and weakness on the weekend.
Dr. Paula noted that, in addition to the accumulated fatigue in a week, there are many objective reasons for the body’s negative reaction to changing conditions.
On the weekend, our lives change dramatically.
"Let's drink for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, but we're probably eating more, and having a drink less, the doctor reasoned.
Because of overeating and a lack of water, gravity and breakdown."
The added role is to be a late recovery.
So if you stand three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called a Jetlag.
It arises from travellers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factors are crucial to the deterioration of self - interest, Paul recommended that we examine the most important changes in the weekend.

South African scientists have stated that the effect of Pfizer vaccine against “mimikorine” has been poor.
In South Africa, Pfizer vs. “OmiCron” vaccine was found to be ineffective.
The scientists of the Republic of South Africa have carried out a study and reported that Pfizer vaccine against omic-stroma of coronaviral infection has had a low impact.
It is estimated that it (the sterilization level) corresponds to (the level) effectiveness of the vaccine at 22.5 per cent against the infection with the symptoms, which ... questions the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, as stated in a study published on the MedRxiv portal.
In doing so, experts have clarified that a drug can save you from a severe flow of disease.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the omics of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars do you have in your regulars?
Sahara is not the best source of useful nutrients.
His surplus can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should bear in mind that a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glythetic index - may be indicated by a word in the product.
The label may contain dozens of names, in fact, representing sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and frigid fruit.
There may also be other red sugar, such as dextroza (maritime sugar), leulosa (fruct sugar), melassa (black stream), syrup ahai etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which are related to mono- and dysacharids, and they can be not only in conditeri products, but also in ketchup, in doctoral bulb, bread, etc.
According to the Russian Federation, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to draw attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
The different types of sugar are different in taste, but whatever the ingredient of the produce - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since not only the quantity of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the package, but also that the vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total quantity of sugar may be much higher than the quantity of sugar indicated in the label.
German Chancellor Scholtz: gas will be no longer important to the FWG in 25 years.
The new chancellor, FWG Olaf Scholtz, said that imports of gas were of importance to Germany because the country was continuing to decarbonize the economy.
He said that by 2045, Germany planned to give up gas, oil and coal completely, becoming a neutral climate.
"That is, 25 years later, the world will be such that the issue of gas transport to the FWG and Europe will play another role," the Chancellor said.
Scholtz noted that Germany continues to commit Ukraine to transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is now important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement indicating the support of Berlin for Ukraine ' s energy transformation.
Formerly, Germany's IM, Annalen Berbock, stated that the process of certification of the gas pipeline “Several flow - 2 is continuing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of coalition negotiations and negotiations on a coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline was still "not in compliance with the requirements" of the European Union.

At the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, was concluded with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
The level of participation in this third ballot was, however, much lower than in the two previous ballots.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51 per cent (2,755) of New Caledonia ' s independence from France was voted against, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
The figure was 43.90 per cent, with the participation of more than 80,000 New Caledonians in the elections.
As France-Presse commented on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt” because the independenceists called on the voters not to vote.
As sponsors of the referendum, they opposed it on 12 December, believing that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Archipelago prevented a full and “clear” campaign of elections.
This failure thus opened the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, and in 2020, 53.3 per cent voted against independence.
The separatists stated that they did not recognize the last ballot and would challenge them at the United Nations.
On Sunday, December 12, at the Elysian Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron was told to speak on the basis of this referendum.
The independence of New Caledonia has greatly rekindled the recent weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates were in favour of the Territory remaining in France, as it was the “last region of the European Union presence in the Pacific”.
"New Caledonia must remain French," said Eric Zemur on several occasions.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valérie Pecres, who issued a column at Le Figaro late in October, urging the Kaledonians to remain French.
Emmanuel McCron, for his part, declared in May 2018 that he would not take the position “because it was not his responsibility”.
Nevertheless, the President added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia”.
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire that the choice of the Kaledonians should be the choice of France”.

Readers of WSJ criticized the article on Russian and U.S. relations
The Wall Street Journal was criticized by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his view of Russian and U.S. relations.
The author of the material expressed concern about the alleged sacrifice of Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger posed by Moscow and allowed a number of offensive remarks to be made against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to “offer a united front against Russia”.
The readers of WSJ disagreed with the American professor's position.
"In this article, there's quite a lot of false information," the RIA News comments one of the readers.
"European is not ours to lose", and Ukraine is not our land.
The US dollars and the NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," said another.

Magnetic earthquake occurred in the Kuril Islands area of 5.2
The magnitude earthquake occurred near the smoker island of Chicotan.
It is noted that the earthquake epicentre was 231.8 kilometres north-east of the town of North-Kurilsk.
It fell at a depth of 92.5 km.
Before, seismologists had recorded an earthquake of 7.5 in Peru, where ten people were injured.
If he had been born into a poor American family and had tried to get out of the community, he would have no idea where his petty thinking would be.

Ukraine will start producing reactive drones of a new generation
In a new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, the ANKA-type jet aircraft will be set up.
This was reported on 11 December by the visiting adviser to the head of the office of Ukrainian President Alexei Arestović.
So they're able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against the airtight.
They will have Ukrainian motors and the rest of the Turkish avionic: the body and the like,” quoting it from Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA machines, Aestovic described the issue of reactive, not destructive, BPLAs.
He says it's a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, who are beyond his "in all characteristics."
The first batch of BPLA is to be produced by a factory at the end of the following year, and is to be completed by Aresovović.
The aircraft of ANKA was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the unmanned was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of Ukraine ' s General Staff, the Office has documented the use of the Bayraktar drones and Jevelin missile systems during the military operations of the combined forces in Donbasa.
On 6 December, Ukrainian President Vladimir Greensky reported that the construction of a modern military unmanned factory had begun in the country.
He said that Ukraine intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and Ukrainian Minoboras entered into an agreement to build a centre in Kiev, where they will provide training for personnel, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar BPFs.
The Ukrainian leader's office press called this memorandum a “greater concrete step forward”.
Two lions escaped at the airport from the container
Lions escaped at Changi Singapore Airport.
The Street Times reports this.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with the seven lions arriving on one of the aircraft.
The publication notes that it remains unknown which country they were brought to Singapore and to which they were sent.
One of the coursing lions settled on the back of the container.
The animals could not depart from him because of a set protective net.
The opposition ended after the arrival of staff of the Mandai Wildlife Group, who was known to all Singapore zoos.
They have defrosted the lions by wires with a tranquilizer and are planning to take them to a quarantine facility.
It has been reported earlier that in Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s capital, the lion fled the master’s path and went through the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast came home voluntarily, and the people were not hurt.
Experts warned of cancer threats due to vitamin B9
Research suggests that surplus vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
Experts believe that there is strong evidence that people with no folic acid are less likely to experience certain cancers, particularly grain cancers.
However, the excess of the necessary dose to the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor Beth Kitchin of the University of Alabama at Birmingham recommends that we monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer is increased only if it is significantly avoided by a larger or smaller proportion.
Kitchin recommends that vitamins B9 should not be accepted in pills without the advice of a doctor, and that the cotton with milk and other foodstuffs that contain pholyeneic acid be taken away and avoided.
Formerly, a nutrition consultant, Rachel Feyn, called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
As she is included in the Avocado, Fain recommended that men, after 50 years of age, should be more likely to have this fruit.
In the United Kingdom, some 75,000 people may die because of the omicron stroma in April.
The projections of British scientists show that the proliferation of coroner-stimulant oms in the next five months in England could lead to the death of up to 75,000 people without tightening restrictive measures in winter.
The Guardian newspaper reported this with reference to an expert study at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), transmitting the TTSS.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the experts who are part of the British Cabinet ' s Disaster Advisory Group will have recorded at least 25,000 deaths by April 2022 due to an omicron strain, while some 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 people every day.
“Serious measures to combat coronavor may be necessary to prevent the overload of the National Health Service if the micron strain is more contagious than the delta option and existing vaccines cannot eliminate infection”, said mathematician Rosen Barnard of LSHTM.
The British Health Security Agency had previously informed that if the micron-stamp distribution rate continued at the current level, about 1 million cases would be reported by the end of the year.
By the middle of December, however, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1,898 cases of omicron-stamp coroner infections have been detected in Britain, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 days.
However, on 9 December, the head of the British Miszdrawa Sadjid Javid indicated that, in reality, that figure could already reach 10,000 cases.
I wanted some smart commentary to write, but I was just going to read it to this place:
“A boom resulting from the enormous suffering of an animal and its second job.”
And there's a hole in the table!
It turns out the "involved animal" was a husband, and I thought it was a flat tire!
The last knight on this planet.
Richard Kray, judging from the puzzles, you don't speak very well for the majority.
What do you mean, that those in the instagrams pretend or they're definitely winning because they don't do anything to them?
It looks like a great net, and everything we've never seen has happened in the past is here.
If you're toss your ass and dig yourself, there's something that's keeping a guard in the middle of it.
It's just that you need to be patient and understand clearly what you're looking for.
The demand for super-harm has risen by a quarter in the world.
This year ' s superheat construction and next-year orders have been a record in the world, despite calls for a reduction of the hydrocarbon footprint and a control of climate change.
In the global court register, the number of yachts ordered was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In an era of climate change mitigation for greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating strength of $50 million and above will not decrease, says The Guardian.
However, there has been an increase in their numbers.
This year, 25 per cent more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there were no 20 years of market activity.
The first is that many who may afford a yacht fear to be contaminated on the ground and prefer to escape the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronary.
If all these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them are working away, and the negotiations are taking action.
Broker Will Christi told the newspaper that the shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that employers are willing to pay more if their yacht is at least one year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super-gods could afford it," he said.
In Western society, many criticize the behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
Rich, social scientists say, they don't want to understand that at the time of being deprived of space travel, living on a yacht or flying their own aircraft, the community is infuriated because the elite doesn't want to share the responsibility for climate change with all humanity.
Economists are calling on Governments to act and suggesting that new taxes and regulations be introduced for the super-poor, although they realize that such money mobility will make it very difficult to do so.
Meanwhile, only the number of super-axes ordered is impressive, but their characteristics are also impressive.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 are over 100 metres long.
Norwegian Reckke's billionaire is building RV Osane yacht at a length of 183 meters.
It'll be the largest boat in the world after going down to the water.
The yacht contains a “soon basin” as well as a submarine designed to study marine depths.
The existing super-ACTs used to include helicopter, open-air cinemas, and some of them, such as McGregor's yacht, as a unity platform.A professor of economic anthropology at the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas samples, the carbon dioxide trail is not significant.
But it's symbolically important given that the world's multi-billionaires are just over 2,000 people.
This is just another example of the overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the Emispheric mark of billionaires is thousands of times more of the world's average statistical population.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the world ' s largest pollutant, Roman Abramovic, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emissions were bent on his Eclipse boat, which was 162.5 metres long.
Even if there is no yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and command to chase the boat, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The owners of super-sympathies do not have the sympathy of others when they, like the richest Australian woman Jean Reinhard, owning a mine on the continent, complain about Utah, that their giant ships have no refuge.
It is also difficult to understand her call for a marina for ships to wash up to 30 feet [50 m].
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to intestinal cancer has been identified
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of cancer.
This is what Daily Express writes about.
Experts have found that the use of four or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of growth in the oncology.
At the same time, the risk of developing the disease increases with the increase in alcohol consumption.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of intestinal cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the precise cause of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a process that is harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, more specifically, loved dogs are convinced that they are intelligent.
But they don't even know how well four-footed they are actually developed.
For many years biologists have experimented to find out how animals develop intelligence.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as large as human, a new study proves that a dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
Scientists were published in Sciencealt.
Dogs can't play chess or poems, have nothing to do with politics, economy and art, but they often succeed in fooling their masters.
Some breeds consider experts to show the best results in understanding human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet sufficient.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally regarded as dog dung, such as Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs can be logical and that they do not give up on a two - year - old.

In Ukraine, ready for US and Russian bidding
The US and Russia will “trade” with regard to Ukraine's entry into NATO, declared analyst Alexander Cochetkov in their article for Glad.
In his view, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on United States safeguards in the near future that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Bayden on the right of “to go anywhere”.
If you're asked to sell a close relative in sexual slavery, for example, you're not going to trade, you're going to go.
"In the case of Ukraine, there is a trade," wrote the analyst.
K Boardtkov added that Russia is not planning to attack Ukraine, but rather is seeking a dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparation is conducted in a secret, quick and immediate manner, rather than waiting for the grouping to detect and deploy forces of resistance,” he said.
China is promoting the railway industry
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries to the China International Rift Exhibition and Production of Equipment, 2021, held in Zhuzhou Province of Hunan/Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically identify and document technical defects, noted the representative of Hou Zjaweng.
High-speed trains on the China-Laos railway line, which was introduced at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with technology, which will increase the reliability and efficiency of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the exports of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing a “Chinese speed”.
In May of this year, the first two-story speed trains developed in China for export to Europe were completed by CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co.
At a maximum speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will be driven on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a test train developed by the company for Turkey was started.
The train will move along the metropolitan line connecting Istanbul to the city airport.
This subway line will be opened next year.
It's going to be the fastest subway line in Turkey at 120 kilometres per hour.
“The Chinese rail machinery industry is one of the most innovative and most powerful international innovative competitiveness industries”, said Feng Yassian, head of the business and investment department of the China International Trade Promotion Committee/CVDC.
“This industry represents the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-quality equipment production in the world market,” said Feng Yassian.
After more than 60 years of intensive work, with a series of independent research and development, China has established a advanced system for the production of rail equipment, with a full range of support tools and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaxian, the country is ranked first in terms of electrification of railways and on high-speed and urban railways.
The Biologist listed early signs of dementia
A candidate for biological science, Simeon Goloshevik, interviewed the radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
He said that signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as incapacity to concentration, planning, and a decline in abstract thinking.
A discussion is under way that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, said the expert.
Goloshakin emphasized that the causes of dementia may be neurogenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolical disturbances, and a lack of vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer ' s disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels were the most common causes of the syndrome.
Biologist noted that to date, doctors are not aware of effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, prevention must begin in time.
He said that studying foreign languages and actively communicating would help to reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends that a moderate level of physical pressure be maintained, and that cognitive skills be trained on a regular basis through games and Hobbies that require the intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic.
"There are recommendations for the application of different BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being debated in the scientific community," said Holshikin.
“The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of a moderate level of physical pressure, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and Hobbies requiring the intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic,” said Goloshin.
Previously, a charity organization for dementia research in Britain stated that people aged 40 and over are increasingly affected by the disease.
Medical researchers called early Alzheimer’s symptoms.
The first disturbing sign is the problem with sight, which makes it difficult for a patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is that it's called aphasia -- a state where people can't find the right words to convey what they want to say.
A neuroscientist asked to send Saakashily for treatment abroad
The former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashily, needs psychosocial treatment and rehabilitation abroad, and told journalists about the neurologist Orar Toidze, who is part of a consultation of doctors established under the Ombudsman of Georgia.
His neurologic status is the leading cause of his illness.
The problems of movement, coordination, variability of character are stable,” the expert said, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and now the ex-President needs to be placed on special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychosocial rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia”, said Toide, requiring Saakawi to be treated in a special institution that is not available in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashivi began sabotaged medical treatment after disciplinary action had been imposed on him by the Prison Service.
The Georgian policy was quickly able to abolish the penalty and restore itself to its former rights.

There were protests in Spain against COVID transport operations
In Barcelona and Valencia, Spanish cities, protests were carried out against the compulsory CPD-19 vaccination certificate, passed by the Europa Press Agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the campaign was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID transports became compulsory for taking up bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, homes of the elderly and night-based entertainment facilities.
Many of the manifests came to act with no masks.
Their slogans have accused the State of totalitarianism and called for the respect of citizens ' choices.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter more than 50 places of entertainment and restaurants.
Protesters in this town have declared a medical dictatorship, and vaccinations have been called a experiment.
In Spain since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronaviral contamination have been identified, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
It is also planned to impose restrictions on non-vaccines in Russia.
The Government introduced the drafts of a single QR code system on 12 November.
It is expected that the Russians will be able to visit mass events, cultural facilities, catering facilities and retail facilities with either the vaccination or transferred disease certificate or the vaccine recovery.
The same rules will be established for travel by train and aircraft.

A good recovery: how the Chinese become mining agents
The Olympics must attract millions of people on slopes and help to create a country's international curatorium
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will bring together President Si Jinpin 1 trillion Yuan, but will also contribute to the economic development of backward provinces.
The Tsangjikow Mining resort, located near the Olympic Winter Games, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, vegetation is also being built, with workers planting trees.
There are over 700 mining resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many regions of China, where the resorts are located, including in Zhangjikou, there are snow problems.
The main challenge for the long term is to get comfortable and fun in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become omnipresent.
But it's still far from that.
The Game Adviser, Justin Downs, said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry had changed to an unknowable one.
Each winter, more and more Chinese go to the slopes.
Fiona, the Beijing snowboarder, one of them.
Despite major changes, it would take many years to establish a mining culture here, as Downs believed.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and build the necessary infrastructure for rest.
Hao Macong is 70 years old, living in Chungli, near the winter Olympic Games.
He notes that there has been a winter sport tourism boom in recent years.
Two years ago, from Beijing in Chunley, there was a high-speed railway, and no local people are now unemployed.
An increasing number of shops are opening up in the country to trade clothes and equipment for winter sports.
The slopes are marked by the general hospital with the dishes of the national kitchen.
There's even a COVID-19 test station on Taiwan now.
China is trying to create a flourishing winter sport industry, its athletes must become the leaders of the world's largest international contest, and the resorts and equipment must be world-wide.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, stated at WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be embroiled in extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has undermined the progress of humankind in the area of universal access to health care, declared in the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WBB).
In connection with the International Day for Universal Health Coverage of 12 December, two complementary reports were published by WHO and WHS.
They found that the pandemic had led to disruptions in the provision of health care services and caused excessive stress in health systems.
In that regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage had declined, and tuberculosis and malaria deaths had increased.
In WHO and WB, it was emphasized that the pandemic had caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, and people were finding it more difficult to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes over 500 million people “to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their pocket”.
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic had led to poverty for over 100 million people, with more than four billion people having little or no social support.

Reuters: The Taiwan Minister was excluded from the broadcast on the White House's Smith for Democracy.
The statement by Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology, Audrey Tan, to the panel discussion during the United States “Summit for Democracy” has been translated into a non-video mode, demonstrates the recording of a summit on YouTube.
Reuters states with reference to sources that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to their reports, Taiwan was given a separate colour map from the PRC, which regards the island of its territory.
The map presented by Mrs. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the world as a civil rights organization.
Taiwan was identified green as free, while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Laos and Viet Nam were marked red as closed.
After the Minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced by a screenshot stating that the views of the participants “did not necessarily express the position of the US Government”.
The PRC wasn't invited to the “Summit for Democracy”.
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwan Minister may have been contrary to the one-China policy maintained by Washington.
One agency source stated that, following the demonstration of the map, the U.S. National Security Council had grudgingly contacted the State, accusing him of having shown Taiwan to a single country.
Washington's “Sammit for Democracy” took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia wasn't invited to the summit.
During the zero-day summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Dmitri Muratov, chief editor, called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption was used for charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary Sovbea Yuri Averjanov stated that the summit was carrying an “anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on the “conceptive withdrawal” between Russia and the United States
The Presidents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with the Izves, assessed the relationship between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction had led to unfortunate conclusions, and problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
Unsightly negative predictability exists, and there is some prospect of improvement in relations that is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long journey that we have passed with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
"It didn't start yesterday," said a diplomat.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is the desire of the U.S. to impose on Russia approaches to a multitude of questions.
The heads of the Ministry added that they would not run the risk of predicting optimistic prospects for improved relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, there had been no progress.
However, Russia called on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hoped that the signals would be heard and that Americans would listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, in a meeting with American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
A virus specialist warned of the risk of inoculation by non-patient drug COVID drug
The emerging COVID-19 vaccine may be allergies and may require medical assistance, so the first points for the drug are not to be organized at airports and shopping centres.
TTSS was informed by a virologist, a member of the ARA, a laboratory for bionologies, microbiology and virology at the University of Novosibir State University of Sergei Netes.
It's easier to organize vaccine sites at airports and shopping centres, but I'd only do it in the first place in the medical system.
The fact is, the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is low, but it is desirable that a person sit next to a doctor's office.
Doctors have special antillergy kits that operate literally in a minute or two, which are very useful sometimes," Nepésov said.
According to the virologist, it would be possible to think of vaccinations in the malls when there was experience in the use of the drug.
He also stressed that when using a visual vaccine, it was important for her to fall on a slippery shell in her nose.
At the same time, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the introductory nose is dried after injection.

That's what Sky News informs us about.
In particular, 1,196 new cases were reported in England, 38 in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people affected by COVID-19 from the new strain in Britain reached 3,137.

Dogs warned of the suffering of Western countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions
President's Spekov's Spokesperson for the Russian Federation commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of the “aggressive action” against Ukraine, including the alleged “invasion” in the country.
“Some restrictions on Russia and not suffering alone are not possible”, said the official representative of the Kremlin on the television channel Russia.
Peskov says it's "understand everything in the world."
It has previously been reported that the United States considers the introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the field of energy as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating rouble conversion into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
However, head Sberbank Herman Gref is convinced that this cannot be done.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final outcome of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of the participants refused to withdraw from France.
This was reported on 12 December by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5 per cent of the votes voted against independence.
Independently from France, 3.51 per cent of the population of the Archipelago in the South Pacific.
Cancelled 2.99 per cent of ballots.
The voting rate was very low: about 55 per cent of the inhabitants of the Archipelago were present.
In the opinion of the experts, the low appearance was due to the separatists ' calls for their refusal to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum date.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
A referendum on independence had already been held in the region in 2018.
The majority of the inhabitants supported the finding of the Archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
France declared New Caledonia its possession in 1853.
Some 270,000 people live in the Archipelago, and the Territory has a special administrative and territorial status.
There is an agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian Administration of 1998 under which the region may vote on its independence twice as different as in two years.

WHO has previously considered the “merikron” to be less dangerous than “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously considered that the “micron” is less dangerous than the delta-stamp of the coroner.
However, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the treatment of new COVID-19.
According to information on 9 December, the “micron” is registered in 63 countries.
“Product data and a significantly modified anti-gen profile of a protein strain, “micron”, suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of a vaccine against infection and the transmission of an option.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it (“the severity of the disease” - art.) may be less severe than in “delte”, says WHO technical communication.
The organization notes that all reported cases of “micron” infection in the EU have been easily or immodestly transmitted to the EU.
However, the new strain, according to the preliminary data, spreads faster than the “delts”.
There are two cases of Omicron-stamp contamination in Russia.
They've been immunized before, reported to the Gamaliel Center.
The head of Roswanazar Anna Popova stated that there is as yet no reliable evidence that the new version of the coroner is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine four scenarios for the Greens were named
Exputation of the Supreme Council, Vadim Denisenko, listed four developments for President Vladimir of Ukraine in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State could remain without the support of the West, as well as compromises on the Donbasa.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko presented this in a publication on the "Gladred" portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called the “ideal storm”, implies that Ukraine will stop supporting key western countries, reaching agreement on the future of the country without its involvement.
This development will contribute to the profound crisis Kiev may face in 2023.
“The price of key goods has been reduced, in parallel, that we have traditionally exported `.> internal protests and opposition to power with key FNG groups (financial and industrial groups).” added ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario in the situation: the war against all.
This forecast will come about in the event of a high level of concern in the world policy, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
This state of affairs may lead to compromises on the Donbasa, which may lead to domestic competition.
At the end of the summer, the position of the Green Seas will be weakened, according to the former Nardepá, to 50-55 per cent.
A third option in Ukrainian policy is to confront dissenting with the Green People's and the President, which may lead to the taking of control of the force block and to the implementation of populist initiatives.
During this option of the crisis, Greenwie will start "reforming power," added Denissenko.
Another scenario is to turn the Greenston into a "national's father."
This could be followed by an event that would be a great shock to society.
"The event must be large enough to cause reactions from external partners and increase support from Ukraine," said Denisenko.
This option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made disaster or Russian aggression, and is considered ex-deputate.
The Russian side has, however, repeatedly rejected any possibility of attack on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that have been increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, a survey of the social science group, Reating, revealed that the Ukrainian President's rating had dropped to record lows of 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since his head of State was elected.
The analysts predicted a situation in which, in the near election of the President of Ukraine for the Greens, only 21.8 per cent would give his voice, while for the ex-President of the country, Peter Porosenko 14.5 per cent.
However, only 19.3 per cent of those questioned expressed support for the President.

Arrested for action on the Red Square poet, "Eutushenko's quote is 10 days, and there she is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchinkov was arrested for ten days.
A WSEC student was arrested in the Red Square with a poster with a hashtag #potherossymitepothetist written on it.
This quote belongs to the writer Evgenia Evtushenko.
A protocol on an administrative article to re-offending the conduct of a public action had been prepared against Alexander.
He was arrested for the first time on 23 January in Puskin Square, a meeting in support of Alexei Navell.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry as a whole, now of interest in it, unfortunately, lost to the fall of the Russian culture of the Russian common, and also a small hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems under this hashtag on the Internet," Alexander explains.
We have contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to give a more detailed account of his message.
How did the police treat you during the detention this time and earlier?
What did you ask at the department, how did you comment on your action?
This time, staff members have been more appropriate, the maximum, polite, however ridiculous, in some context of the word.
In Puskin, they took the Moonows and took them.
Asked standard, motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked if it wasn't good enough, it understood.
Except for the apes on all four sides, everything was perfectly adjusted, but I knew what was going on.
And if after this hashtag starts writing its poems, at least a few people, I'm ten days old.
According to the protocol, speak at least the Tumba-jumba language.
At public and official events, it was said in the language of others that it would be clear to everyone what had happened in Bundestag on 25 September 2001 or in their mother tongue by means of an interpreter.
This protocol, by the way, is excellent for Angel Merkel to speak in Russian and, nevertheless, to seek the assistance of an interpreter.
Also in official events, there are transcripts on the old authorship, and the stenographer is not obliged to speak several languages.

Because of the large content of the tick, it is useful for a stomach tract, and regular use can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the best benefit, the roots are better to stay awake or to cook than to burn on butter.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous to diabetes, as well as other high-healing products.
These are carbohydrate products that quickly cut off sugar, such as sugar, sweet drinks, white rice and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Commersantt warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in production in personal support and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, product deficits could only be replaced by imports at the moment.
Lostfilm, rdfilm and other pirates will be removed from the edition of the Yandeks.
Candidates for exit
In 2015, rights-holders from the cluster of RAEC/Media made a list of 100 of the largest pirate sites and most of them ceased to exist, according to Karen Cazarian, director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some people -- Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix -- did survive through the regular change of home name, and he added.
For example, the Losfilm, which is available in search of both the Yandex and Google, can be seen by pirate copies of the Netflix Game in Calmar, and the Inevitability of Director Anne Melician, the original Russian video series of the largest video service ivi in Russia.
Keinogo, which is also available in the field of research, can be seen in Enconto's animal news, but it is a so-called screen (a pirate copy of a film in a movie theater) according to the quality of the video.
A Universion series, 10 years later, is available on the Flex, which can also be found through search engines.

"This is a Polish idea" -- you could think of Poland as the only one that has transformed the 1776 idea, but has developed it in a very efficient way.
In fact, it was 1848 C.E. that the slogan "Curtain - Not Russia" appeared.
Which, in general, doesn't change the whole thing.
I watched her interview, and the girl said that she had the greatest dream of growing her wings, that her dad would constantly resuscitate her.
Well, as if it's all very doubtful.
So I went to the school, and then what?

The model is convenient because it has two different vistas of the surface: a high hardness and slightly more than the average.
Only qualitative and substitute filling substances are included, which have been recommended solely on the best side.
Ranges: An independent spring unit is placed at the centre of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the bedroom that operate completely autonomously.
It is their function that provides a unique precision.
The Microcactet is the most frequent of the diversity of the spring blocks Demetxa, so it has a bright orthopaedic effect and is considered to be superior.
Beneficiaries: layer together with natural latex are installed from above and below the spring.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one of the surfaces has latex, the other has coconut.
Such a dance of filling substances has long been classic since it gives the mattress not only orthopaedic but also anatomic properties.
If the collar provides the right back support, the latex provides an adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Chehol: The model is presented in a simple, tri-tacular sneeze, Aloe Vera.
If the client so wants, he can be made both in-depth and static.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load for the dormitory is 170 kg.

Estonian Scientists Will Look for Life in Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, prepares three space missions to Venus to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday "The Arctic Chamber".
Five years later, the purpose of the missions is to assess the lifeworthiness of Venus's clouds and then to look for life there.
For the project, Tatar scientists proposed tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in Venus clouds.
So far it has been assumed that Venus’s clouds, which are near the Earth’s Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but perhaps Venus was originally an Earth - type.
During the third mission, a trial must come from Venus.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question is whether it is similar or different.
If we are very similar, it will be obvious that earth’s life did not start on Earth.
"If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said Michael Pausal, head of the Estonian team of Venus Life Finder.

The Metallied Change Russian Business
The theme of the meta-villed was popular this autumn of the year when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook had become Meta.
For the market, this event has become an important signal: the biggest player has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction among people.
Which means that business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own metamables and their subsequent monetaryization.
Metalled persons should be seen as continuation of objective existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend to create remote interactions in a pandemic has been abandoned, as people have lost sight of the separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is the business effort to develop ecosystems and adapt business models to them.
From the third, it is a logical continuation of the digitalization trend, where all rights, securities, works of art and even money are digitized.
Ania, you're right, changing nutrition is an informed process.
When you start eating right, you don't want something too fat and harmful.
Of course, we're going to have a holiday and a traditional olive tree, and a spleen under a coat, but no one's making me eat all of us at once.
You can eat in a spoon, try it and stop it.
After all, there are ten weekends to come, and every delicious and useful meal can be prepared.
And the amount of hell's work, time, it took her training.
And when she finished 5 fourths of the jumps, she was left without gold.
She also realizes that she won't stand four years before the next Olympics, i.e. she'll never be an Olympic champion.
And whoever doesn't just practice sports, or can't imagine the whole circle of hell that she's passed, don't go along with it.
The British economist was unable to forecast the year 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict for 2022 because, in his opinion, such an attempt would be a failure.
He wrote about it in the article for Project Identity.
The expert believes that next year will be filled with unpredictableness and any trend may change the course of the year.
The coroner's pandemic remains the most important factor, and second, inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he didn't know whether the price increase for goods was temporary or not.
According to a specialist, it was clear before the pandemic that the “peace of endless generosity of central banks” had already expired and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates, based on inflation, would be adjusted to the expected growth rate of GDP.
O'Neill noted that, in the background of the pandemic, continuation of a superflexible economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new upsurge in inflation.
In addition, the issue of productivity growth, poverty and climate change has been summarized by O'Neill.
In the past, Michael Schulgin, head of the Global Investment Research Division, reported that positive expectations at the dollar rate for 2022 remained, with less growth potential.
Among the risks to the dollar, Schulgin referred to the Fed monetary policy, the trend in oil prices and the fear of the coroner's pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is that if we were to compare ourselves, there were fewer containers five years ago.
It's better now.
There's progress, but it's slow.
The problem is that there are many environmental initiatives in the cities, but people don't know about them.

Russia gave the motor dealers about 4.5 per cent of the country's GDP
As a result of the 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent 2 trillion roubles, 784 billion roubles on new vehicles, 28 per cent more than in the same period of the previous year, according to the statistics provided by the russian Automative Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and economies during the coronavius pandemic.
In last September, at the meeting of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
Income in the Russian market leads the Korean brand of Keya.
In 10 months of the year, it was able to carry out a total of 325.7 billion roubles, almost 24 per cent more than it had been a year earlier.
More than 35 per cent of the growth in the Kia family's Hyundai mark is estimated to be 279.3 billion roubles.
In leading positions, this brand, and by increasing the weighted average car price, grew by almost 21 per cent in a year at Hyundai, to 1.94 million rubles, with only Chang, Chery, Geely, and Mercedes-Benz.
The sales of Korean brands, however, did not increase significantly: according to the statistics of the European Business Association ' s committee of automakers in Russia, Kia had realized a 9.4% over a year earlier in the same period.
Hyundai, it's almost 12%.
In monetary terms, three leaders of sales to Toyopa, Japan, spent 275.5 billion roubles on the stamp in 10 months, 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz, with an average of 266.1 billion roubles (+75%), with a German premium-brand growing and sales volume (37%), and an average weighted car price (almost 28%, to 8.2 million roubles).
"The Mercedes-Benz also has a good growth in sales and a weighted average price -- more, for example, than BMW, from here to here, and a higher financial capacity -- explained the NPI Gender Tatian Arabjee.
The rate of growth in sales has been fantastic in China's brands, and it has also significantly increased the financial capacity this year.”
Russian Laada shows average figures (plus 28 per cent) on income growth, and the Russians spent 229.4 billion roubles on it in 10 months.
At the financial capacity level of last year, there are companies whose sales of cars dropped in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan, among others.
FAS and mine itself - in 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion roubles on off-roads and pickles, compared with 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems in the supply of auto-competitions and disruptions in production around the world, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices, with the same "AvotoWAZ" increasing the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last journey (8 to 10,000 roubles) took place in late November.
Prices for their products and other automakers are regularly copied.
In monetary terms, Russia's road market will continue to increase, apart from the shortage of cars, inflation, as well as the desire for auto-concepts to win past losses, experts are deemed to have contributed to it.
In the event of a shortage of cars, I think that many auto-concepts have even been able to partially shift the costs of past periods to consumers, which they could not put into the price of cars earlier,
Says "VTB Capitral" on Vladimir Bespalov's car.
I believe that, financially, car manufacturers are feeling very good at this moment, supporting the high marginality of the sales.”
The rate of increase in the cost of cars observed during 2021 is an indirect indicator of this, and the prices of new vehicles are increasing faster inflation, as the expert points out.
In the long term, the market will increase in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly through inflation and machine complexity, predict the Bespalls.
As the supply increases, there will be limited opportunities to raise prices.
In monetary terms, the Russian author will continue to grow and, in the coming year, even if the cost of cars is slow, the car manufacturers will be able to get their income from volumes, noting the independent car consultant Sergei Bourgaslii.
Given the increased demand and the insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now seeking the greatest profits from every car sold, notes Bourgasley.
The increase in vehicle production is not expected at least in the next six months, and the Japanese doyotage is also being heated by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the backdrop of the market situation, motor vehicles have proved to be a good source of investment -- a car bought a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold at a higher cost, notes the expert.
Baiden commented on the transfer of the United States military to Ukraine in the event of Russia’s invasion.
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending American military personnel to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion.
President Joe Baiden of the United States made this statement.
"Never had such plans," said the head of the White House, answering a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Baiden noted that in the event of the escalation of the situation around Ukraine, the Russian Federation would experience economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of applying the United States troops unilaterally to Ukraine ' s defence was not on the agenda.
Baiden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States would send forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovakia).
“We will have to send more United States and national troops to the eastern flank, B9 all NATO countries against which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia” stated Baiden.
Previously, Russian President’s Spock Press Secretary emphasized that Moscow had no intention of entering Ukrainian territory.
However, he indicated that Moscow saw the problem in the fighting of Kiev's vessels laid down by Turkey and in the “American armament approaching our territory”.

If the interviewers want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink unexplained grafts, and another cup of soap, it's terrible to think of what's going to happen at work.
I'll find myself a normal place to be, without an Eyscark, where you're talking to the leader right away.
