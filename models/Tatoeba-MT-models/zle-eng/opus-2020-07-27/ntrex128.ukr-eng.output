The members of the Wales assembly are concerned about what will be “associated with the cartpets”
Some members are frightened by the recommendation to change the name of their position as “member of Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This recommendation came out of plans to change the name of the assembly to "Parliament Wales."
A part of the political spectrum is concerned that it can provoke ridicule.
A VENE from the LIBRARY stated that his group was troubled by a rum of Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales, in Welsh, “twp” means “unsatisfiable” and “pwp” means an act of defecation.
A DAY from the Wales Party stated that his group was generally “unsatisfied” and suggested alternatives.
One Welsh conservator said that his group was “unforeseeable” before changing its name, but pointed out that MWP could quickly become a "mappet."
In this context, the pronunciation "w" is similar to that of the Yorkshire English word "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing legislation to change names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of members of the Assembly will certainly be made by members themselves.”
Since 2017 the Law on Self - Administration of Wales has given us the right to change the name of the Assembly of Wales.
In June, the Commission published a public discussion of offers, and the name of the assembly to Parliament of Wales received wide support.
In terms of what we call the VAC, the committee proposes to call them “WMP Members of the Wales Parliament, but the MWP option has the greatest public support.
Of course, this is an alternative, but trying to reach an agreement may cause problems for Chief Elin Jones, who should file a bill of changes over the course of a few weeks.
The Reform Law will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the withdrawal of the Part and the structure of the Committee system.
A FATHER will hold a final vote regarding its new name when it is discussed in the legislation.
The Macedonians go to a referendum for a change of country name
On Sunday, voters vote to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote was organized to settle a long - term dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that their northern neighbor’s name is a claim in Greece, and it has been repeatedly opposed to membership of Macedonia in the EU and NATO.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, who is opposed to holding a referendum to change the name, said that he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, followers of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is simply the price to pay for the accession to the EU and NATO.
St. Maarten's calls are silent, because the Harlem churches are going through difficult times.
"The old people I have associated with are said to have been here earlier in every corner of the world as a bar and as a church," says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither one nor another.’
He thinks that the disappearance of bars can be understood to mean:
"People today are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer the same as the local living room where they regularly come in.”
As far as the churches are concerned, Adams fears that money from selling assets will last longer than the leaders hope, and that “they will sooner or later end up where they started”.
The churches, he added, could replace houses with condo, and there would be people who would not help the shrines that remained nearby.
“ The vast majority of the people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” explained Adams, “so it will speed up the day when all these churches close up, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominium will become members of them. ”
Both churches were built by the white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolated Community Church was built in 1870 and Saint Marten ten years later.
The Root White Methodist Community left in the 1930s.
The black community nearby was given ownership of the building.
St. Maarten moved to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycottt of retail merchants on the 125th street, the main street of Harlem, and these merchants refused to hire blacks and raise them in the service.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by the fire, but Johnson’s father’s parishioners wanted to rebuild it and installed the carillion.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor to Johnson's father in Saint-Marthena, proudly referred to the Carilion as "the bells of the poor."
The Expert, who played the purple in July, described it differently as “cultural treasure” and “an indispensable historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that this is the world's first carillion to be played by the black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who was transferred 18 years ago to a bigger Carillion in the Church of Riverside.
According to Mr. Merriweser, there was no substitute in St. Maarten.
What's happening in Saint-Martney over the last few months is a complicated story about architects and subcontractors, some of them involved by church leaders, others by the Episcopal Archdiocese.
The council is the governing body of the parish, composed of the world leaders, in July, wrote to the diocese that is concerned that the diocese “will try to convey the cost” but that the council did not participate in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishes complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark was injured by a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California.
Officials say that on Saturday, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark, and that the boy was a diver in California on the day of the opening of the frontal season.
The attack occurred at almost 7: 00 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that morning he had been about half an hour's diving with friends when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and together with a group went to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a capture of the caught lobbyer, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
As soon as he reached the boy, he found that his key was completely broken.
“ I shouted every one of them would come out of the water, "A shark's water!" added Hammel.
The boy was taken to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
A rescue captain, Larry Giles, for the media briefing, said that a few weeks ago, a shark was observed in the area, but it was found that it did not refer to the dangerous species of sharks.
Jails added that the victim received traumatic injuries from the upper part of the body.
In the search and security efforts, authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto in Casablanca to Sámi in Encinitas.
Jails noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsburi's going to go out to the British cosmetic market.
Sainsury's going to compete with Bots, Superdrug and Debenhams by using cosmetics like those in the department.
As a result of increasing output to the British space market, £2.8 billion continues to rise at a time when sales of clothes and household goods are declining, the more space is going to be tested in 11 shops around the country, the next year, if the idea of success is to be, the islands will appear in other shops.
Investments in cosmetics are linked to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to make use of the space that used to be used on TV, microwave furnaces, and household goods.
In Sainsbury's said they'd double the science of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, of which brands would appear for the first time Rellon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burton's Bees will have more space: brandy zones will appear like those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also upgrades the Boutique cosmetic: Now most of the goods represented are not going to be tested on animals, which is increasingly required by young buyers.
Besides, the retailer's Fragrance Chop protestes his trays in two Sainsburiy's shops: the first tray opened in Croydon, north London, last week, and the other opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and going into buying small amounts of food every day in small shops makes supermarkets make an extra effort to attract visitors.
Mike Coop, executive director of Sainsburi's, said that their shops would become more like a department store because the network of supermarkets is trying to resist Aldi and Leidl's discs with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's open offices to Argos at hundreds of their shops, and also open a series of Habitats. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and said it increased sales of food goods and made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt at upgrading cosmetics and pharmaceuticals to the supermarket was a failure.
Sainsury's tested to cooperate with Bots in the early 2000s, but it ended up with a debate about how to separate incomes from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came out after Sainsburiy's sold its pharmacist business (281 pharmacies) Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an extended team of luxuriant skin brands, including La Roche-Pasey and Vicey, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsburi, stated: “We changed the appearance of our cosmetic islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant to customers.
We also invested in trained counselors who could provide advice.
The brands that we have presented are called upon to satisfy any need, and a pleasant environment and a comfortable place means that we are now an attractive location for buying cosmetics, which is a competition for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones' "scrapers" because Holly Willoughby went out with a £11 million deal.
The dragon's Light Star, Peter Jones's "scrapers" because TV player Holly Willoby made an agreement with his brand of goods for life (the contract cost is £11 million) to focus on the new Marks & Scienter and ITV contracts
Willoughby has no time for a brand of home clothes and axipals, Trule.
The couple's business was connected to Goo-Guinet Peltrow's brand.
This 37-year-old program manager, Heis Morning announced her entrance to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby led Peter Jones' lie star to the story when the last moment came from their profitable business of life goods to focus on the new business contracts with Marks & Scienter and ITV.
The source reports that Jones is "suckling" when a gold girl from the TV confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesdays at Jones’s business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new covenants cost £1.5 million to mean that she no longer has enough time to dedicate it to their common brand of home clothes and acessors, Truly.
This business had to do with the brand of Goop Guineat Peltrow and had to double Willoughby's statue, which is estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37-year-old, reported to Instagram, coming from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his rest houses.
The source reported: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s main priority.
He was to be its long - term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to leave the business was a shock to all interested parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, almost on the eve of a launch.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a complete warehouse of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that one of Britain's most highly paid stars was the departure of This Morning, one of Britain's leading stars, could cost the firm millions because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and clothes) and create further delays in launching.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cappe, for ten years.
Willoughby and Cap created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined in March as head of government.
They held festivals together, and Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of a television company called Baldwin.
Willowby will be the ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Anthony McPartyin as lead I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source near Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
Hard conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism that the news media would get for a comment that someone would consider to be “non-presidential, ” as well as a very positive attitude toward North Korean leader.
“ Why did President Trump make such a big deal? ”
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news conductor. —
I did not go any further than that."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump named their first meeting in Singapore in June as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations went into a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Hoe, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea could not see the “responsible reaction” from the United States on its first disarmament steps.
Instead, he noticed, the U.S. continues with pressure-support sanctions.
While giving a talk at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea, ” he stated.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such a beautiful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kima had yielded positive results: the end of the missile trials, the liberation of hostages, and the return of the remains of American military personnel to their homes.
He also promoted his unusual approach in dealing with Kim.
“ It’s so easy to behave as presidents, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this beat-up stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there, ” said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island, and hundreds of people died.
In particular, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they needed no help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been affected, the national catastrophe has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they didn’t seek international help, so that’s a bit difficult, ” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children, the crew is going to live in Palau until it is clear that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sotopo, a representative of the national disaster management agency, stated that the Indonesian authorities appreciated the situation in Palau to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Given that Indonesia has continued to experience earthquakes, the country remains terribly unprepared for nature’s wrath.
There are tsunami shelters in the province of Aceh, but they are not typical of other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of siren warning of the tsunami in Palau, although warnings were effective, probably contributed to death.
Moving between a multitude of Indonesian islands is more than just the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake would sail to Palau, but it would be possible to reach the location of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joco Wydodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure as the basis for his campaign and has increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the funding deficit created a problem for Mr. Joko’s administration, which plans to move in the next year.
Mr. Joko also obstructs prolonged interfaith strife in parts of Indonesia, where the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have died, tens of thousands have been evicted from their homes as a result of opposition from Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets by using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

Cromwell's Statue near Parliament becomes a new monument, which is going to suffer from the "rewriting of history"
The removal of the statue would be deserved by the payment of the destruction in the Taliban style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatic Portuguese followers.
But Cromwell's community called Mr. Crick's suggestion "study" and "the attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmit, head of Cromwell's Community, said: "In view of the current debate about the taking of a statue, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell at the Westminster Palace was inevitable."
There was neither Cromwell himself nor at his command, the icons of England’s civil wars.
It is likely that Cromwell undeservedly will be sacrificed for the action of his predecessor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell, the sculptor William Hamo Tornecroft, is a testimony to the mood of the 19th century and to a part of the historic painting of a figure that many think is still worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmit told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many are probably more at the end of the 19th century than they now consider Cromwell to be a parliamentary defender from external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Is such an idea entirely accurate — the subject of the long - held historical debate?
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the well-known figures that represents one side of the conflict.
His achievements as the Protector Lord are also worth noting and honoring.”
Killer Lead Destroyed a Chinese farmer to Death
Local media reports that a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
A man who was only identified by the name of Yuan was found dead in blood with a broken artery at a pig’s market in Liupánchuy, the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In June, the province of Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005, the pigs will be vaccinated in pigs.
On Wednesday he reportedly left his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and found that the door of the pigfish was open.
The brother pointed out that there was a big cab with blood on its mouth.
The forensic medical expert confirmed that the farmer was killed by a 249-pound cable.
“My cousin’s feet were in blood and distorted, ” stated a cousin of the victim named Wu, quoted by Guyang Evening News.
The security record showed that Joan had entered the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Eventing News that when the police collected the evidence at the scene, the pig was locked to prevent its attack on the people.
Seven of me, Yianne, and the market administration, are said to be discussing his death compensation.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on people have been recorded before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years before that pig weighed 295 kg, he held a Welsh farmer tight to the tractor until the farmer’s wife threatened the animal.
After the farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, one of the Manitoby farmers said CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a tiger.
"They're playful.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect, ” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring massive rains southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa was predicted to weaken, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the next day, Rose will bring floods to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
Rose had a speed of 137 km per hour (this hurricane category 1) by 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to move north.
In the meantime, the Pacific Ocean begins to form an east - west rainwater to the west coast of the United States, which, when it approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday, will start pushing the tropical rainwater north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose, it rains up to 25.4 feet [2.4 cm] in parts of Mexico.
Then, in the next few days, the tropical humidity that interacts with the coming rainwater will create strong torrential rains in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 inches [2.2 cm] of rain will cause dangerous rain floods, torrential torrents, and the possibility of a shift in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will increase rainfall by up to 5 to 7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm is expected to rain in some parts of the southwest, especially in the vast area of Arizona.
Rainwater floods are possible when conditions are rapidly deteriorating because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We are urged not to walk to the desert because tropical rain is possible.
Heavy rains can make the canyons violent in rivers, and storms will bring storm winds and dust storms.
The approaching of the valley will cause heavy rains in some parts of California’s northern coast.
Rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause inefficient waste streams and slippery roads.
It'll be the first downpour in the region during the rainy season.
Some of the scattered tropical rainstorms will start approaching Arizona late on Sunday and morning, and in the evening, the rain will become larger on Monday and Tuesday.
Big rain will be coming over the FairCorners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October there may be intense temperatures throughout the United States because the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this can lead to sharp temperatures at short distances.
On Sunday, you will see a fine example of the sharp temperature swings in the central United States.
This is almost a 7-graded temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De-Mones, Iowa.
During the next few days, summer’s warmth will try to come back and spread again.
In a large area of central and eastern America, it is expected that up to October, the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can be as high as 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesdays, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of average temperatures being exceeded in eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched the rumour in the Brett Cavanano case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched the stand of the candidate for the post of Justice of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavano and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which was said to have taken place in the 1980s.
The political resistance continued, the channels interrupted the planned programs to report the latest news of Friday: the agreement prepared by Senator Arison Jeff Flake about the FBI's one-week investigation of the charge.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Committee that she's 100 percent confident that Cavano was huddled with her drunk and was trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, the cavana said that he was 100 percent sure he wasn’t there.
It's likely that on Friday more than 20.4 million people were watching this thing, as reported by the Nielsen research company.
The company calculated an average of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Could not get the numbers immediately on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching television in offices.
In comparison, such an audience is similar to the audience that is watching the playoff series or the Oscar Prize.
Fox News Channel, whose leading think show strongly supported Cavanano's assignment, was the leader of all channels in a hearing that lasted the entire day, with an average attendance of 5.69 million, pointed out in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after listening.
Flash is the central figure of the Friday drama.
This moderate republican's office published a statement saying he's going to vote for CNN and CBS on Friday morning, and then recorded how the protestors were screaming at Flake when he was trying to go to the elevator to hear the Judicial Committee.
He stood there with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was blighted, streaming live into CNN.
“ I’m standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have authority, and there are many women who are powerless."
Flake reported that his office had published an application and had added more to the committee’s hearing before the elevator closed.
All cables and broad - open channels were broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee was to vote on the proposal of Kavano for a full vote to the Senate.
Fleak said he'd only do that if he knew the FBI was looking into the charges against the candidate next week, which would require a democratic minority.
Flake became partially convinced of the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Cuns.
After talking to Kuns, and then with a few other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was influential, because it was clear that the Republicans would have no vote to appoint Kavano as a candidate without investigating.
President Trump initiated the FBI investigation into the charge against Kavano.
British Prime Minister Theresa May blames critics for “games in politics” around Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her critics of coming out of the European Union in “games in politics” with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview that took place next to Teresa's interview on the front page of the newspaper, the former foreign minister of her government, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Chester's Plan on Brexite, claiming to offer Britain and the EU to draw each other's tribute "totally absurd."

The volcano throws ashes into Mexico City
The ashes, which discharges Mount Popocatepetl, reached the southern regions of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Disaster Warning Centre on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano because of the activity of the crater, which registered 183 gas and ashes in 24 hours.
The center followed up on numerous noises and shocks.
The picture on social networks shows fine layers of ash on frontal glass of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Namiliko.
Geophysicists observed an increase in the activity of a volcano 45 miles (72 km) southwest of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 degrees in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police faced Catalan separatists on the eve of the independent voting anniversary
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, following the encounter of police special forces protestors in the city, and thousands of people joined the protests to mark the first Catalonia poll anniversary on separation.
A prosthetic group in masks, which had been held back by specialists, threw eggs and powdery paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that were usually full of tourists.
The skirmishes took place and later on that day, the police used sticks to hold back the aggression.
A few hours later, groups of independent people who complained, “Don’t forget, don’t forgive! ” were confronted by those who cried out, “Hay Spain! ”
According to a local press report, 14 people were helped to cope with the light injuries sustained by protests.
A year after the referendum of October 1, recognized by Madrid as illegal but marked by Catalan separatists, the tension in an independent region remains high.
The voters decided to vote for independence, but the appearance was low, since most of those who opposed separation were boycottts.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent collisions last year as a result of police attempts to stop voting in voting stations throughout the region.
The independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but I had to go on another route.
The 68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, stated that he no longer had hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"We went through one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry for joy that they could vote, but now we are in a dead corner, ” he said.
Despite their vital but very complex victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that stand for independence failed to maintain this year's momentum, because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or in prison waiting for their participation in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanics protesting police support on the phone, claimed that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“Tension is increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday Oriel Hunqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in surveillance since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament next year.
“The article of the candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regress of the democratic values and repression that we see from the Spanish government, ” he said.
The men were arrested after the car entered the house.
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car had driven into a house in London several times.
The incident occurred on Thursday at 7:30 in British standard time.
Detective Inspector Bob Belmings noted that the gate was damaged and the house itself was damaged.
It is quite possible that at some point a car was fired from an artillery.
Kill Mengi won the Lavingston over the Rangers with the account 1-0
The first head of Dolly Mangi in the Luvingston has been victorious.
The Luvingston elevated the Rangers and gave Stephen Gerard a second defeat of 18 games as the manager of the Aybrox Club.
Dolly Mengi's hit turned out to be decisive: the team, Gary Holt, went up one level in a second from Cybernian.
The Gerard's team won no victory at this season's Premier-Lise election, and the next Sunday, they play with the Harss leaders, who are behind it on eight points.
Prior to that, on Thursday, the Rangers will be hosted by the River Vienna in the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Lavingston continues its unconquerable walk up to six games in the Division, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet been defeated after he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the odds of innocuous guests.
Holt's team had to be ahead of them long before they were killed, because their directness created every problem with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson burst through the defense, but made a blow along the gate, then alan Litgo shot past the gate after a while and took the hit by Craig Hallett along the gate, which he made his head.
The hostels were pleased that they allowed Rangers to play with them, and they knew that they could cause regular guests problems.
That's how the final goal was killed.
The Rangers missed the free blow, and the Lavingston discovered, Declan Gallagher and Robinson engaged Mengo, who took the ball and killed it from the center of the fine.
Until then, Rangers was dominated by the power of the ball, but the protection of the lords of the field turned out to be untenable and Liam Kelly's gate was largely unanticipated.
This trend continued in time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman hit a needle named Rangers Allan McGreg, hit the gate by another standard Lington combination.
The Nasses regularly entered the Livingston fine and consistently neutralized, and the two applications for the penalty were rejected after the Hulkette attack on Glenn Midlton.
Livingston: Analysis
Alladare Lamont of "BC Scotland" at Theton Macaroni Arena Stadium
Luvingston's Fannamal Game and the outcome.
They all played a great one, and they kept waiting for this ascending path.
Their style of play and warehouse has remained virtually unchanged after they have returned to the highest level, but the Hall has to be given due credit for how it mobilized the team after its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halquet played grandly, organized a very good defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to keep on the watch.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerard’s leadership, but now they are far from reaching those standards.
They didn't get enough of the last ball -- only once they broke out the defenses of the landowners -- and it was a kind of awakening for the Rangers, who ended up in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was received in various ways at Cologne.
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, they could see smiles and blue skys.
This is the last day of the conflicting visit of President Erdogan to Germany to re-establish a relationship between NATO allies.
They have raised some controversy over such issues as human rights, freedom of the press, and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to discover a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police didn't let 25,000 people meet in front of the mosque, but many of the president's supporters still showed up nearby to see it.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan — including many Kurds — also forced themselves to hear, condemning Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
The two - way protests reveal the uncertainness of a guest, which some German Turks called a hero and others a dictator.
Depford road accident: A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car
The bicycle driver was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened at the Besudt Street Cross and Evelyn Street on a lively road to the Desptford area in the south of town at about 10:15 a.m. in Britain's standard time.
The driver stopped, and the medical staff arrived at the scene, but the man was killed.
This accident occurred a few months after another cyclist had died after a driver had escaped from the accident at Childers Street, about 1.6 km from a Saturday accident.
The London Police said that they were working on setting up a man to inform his immediate family.
The bus routes are also prohibited, and motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long Lantín prison: six prison inmates were injured in riots
Six of the prison staff were injured as a result of a male prison riot, and the prison administration was informed.
Her Majesty Long Lantin's imprisonment in Woostershire began at about 09:30 a.m. a week.
To stop the riots initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special unit called Tornado was called.
The officers were given medical care in connection with the light injuries of the face that they received at the scene.
The prison officer commented: “In order to resolve the incident in Her Majesty Long Latin Prison, a specially trained prison staff was involved.
Six co-workers received medical treatment in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we clearly understand that those responsible will be sent to the police and their period of detention may be extended.”
In Her Majesty Long Lantín's prison, more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief had been sent to a permanent hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, a special police unit was summoned to prison to stop the serious riots that had been attacked by prisoners with billions of balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the Feniks, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with torrential floods (shrived areas can benefit)
Tropical depression rarely hit Arizona, but that could happen at the beginning of the next week, since the remains of Hurricane Rosa are heading southwest of the desert, risking torrential floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of Monday floods and Tuesdays from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Fennix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through the Fenix on Tuesday, and it will rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service of Fienix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles (322 km) of Fienix since 1950,
a Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to recent forecasts by the National Hurricane Centre, the area of the Mogollon Roma in Arizona is projected to be 5.08 to 10.16 cm, with places of up to 15.24 cm.
Other parts of the south-west of the desert, including the central part of the Rockies and the Big Basin, are likely to receive between 2.54 and 5.08 cm of rainfall, possibly up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, Rosie’s rain may be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these downfalls are likely to be useful, because the south-west is now experiencing drought.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Centre, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers at least from extreme drought, the second highest category of drought, reportsweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path causes a shift on the Mexican peninsula in Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in the power of a hurricane at the speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm encounters more cool water in the Pacific Ocean and thus weakens.
Thus, a tropical storm is expected to cause a drought in Mexico during the day or in the evening.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico may be significant, creating considerable flood risk.
“The total rainfall from Lower California to Northwest Sonora is expected to be between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm,” reportsweather.com.
Rose will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue through Arizona and reach south Utah late in the evening.
“The basic danger expected of Rose or her remains is the heavy rains in California, California, Northwest Sonori, and the southwest American desert, ” reports the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to lead to life - threatening torrential floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as a shift in the mountainous region.
Attack at Midsomer-Norton: Four persons arrested who attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after having found a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds in Somerset.
An injured teenager was found in the Exscior Terras area of Midsomer-Norton at about 04:00 in British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock district, and reported to Avon and Somerset police.
Police are asked to respond to everyone who can have any video recording of these events on the phone.
Trump says Cavanano was “serious and angry ” of the Democratic Party
“The judge for Judge Kavano is a voice against the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party, ” stated Trump at a rally in William, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanano was “suffered and angry” by the Democratic Party throughout the whole hanging process.
Cavanano gave a witness before Congress on Thursday, grudgingly and emotionally denying the accusation that Christine Blaise Ford had committed sexual assault on her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified on hearing the charges she made.
On Saturday, the President stated that on that day, "the American people saw the glamour, character and courage" of Kavano.
“The judge for Judge Kavano is the voice for one of the most trusted lawyers of our time, a lawyer with the irreprehensible experience of public service, ” he said to a crowd of adherents in West Virginia.
The President made a quick mention of Cavanaugh's drying when he spoke of the importance of Republicans' appearances in the medium-term elections.
“The next five weeks will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, ” he said.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the mission of democracy is to “oppose and hinder”.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for the Kavano candidature is expected to take place not later than Friday, and CNN told one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds died of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number of casualties increased
At least 384 people were killed, many were washed away in the ocean when huge waves swept up on the beach as a result of the intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawves and declared the country’s authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) in the evening fell on the beach, beating many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami took place after an earthquake of 7.5 points.
“When the tsunami struck yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and did not run immediately, and they were victims,” stated Sutopo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian disaster management agency (BNPB) at Jakarta.
“It wasn’t just a tsunami; it was moving a car, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on the land, ” said Nugroho, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami had passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 m/h).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed to trees and survived, adding.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
Aerophotographies published by the disaster - management agency show that many buildings and stores are destroyed, bridges are turned out and destroyed, and mosques are surrounded by water.
The flights in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the severe earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow cove, could contribute to the tsunami, declared the agency.
Nugroho called the damage “wide-scale” and pointed out that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the debris of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had been missing.
Nugroho noted that victims and injuries could be more than 300 km (190 miles) along the coast line north of Palau in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
"The lines of communication have been completely damaged and we haven't got any information" from Donghali,” said Nugroho.
There, more than 300,000 people live, says the statement of the Red Cross, and it adds that its personnel and volunteers have gone to the affected areas.
“ It’s a tragedy, but it can be much more, ” says the report.
On Saturday the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palau, even though officials said that the waves had arrived at the time indicated in the warning.
The amateur images that people have shared in social networking show how a man on the top of the house shouts violent warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below the building.
A few minutes later, the wall of the water broke into the beach, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't check the frame's trueness immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused a serious power cut that has cut off the link around Palm, making it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
The airlifters began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, informing the authorities, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other essential necessities.
The city’s airport was opened for help only, and it would be closed until October.
President Joko Wydo was to visit the evacuation centres in Palau on Sunday.
The number of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's too bad.
The World Vision and Donggal staff safely reached the city of Palau, where they hid in the tarpaulin tents set up in the yard of their office, but along the way they saw the scenes of devastation, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they had seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
That's too bad.
Even when relief teams took action to deal with the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Palau with great experience.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supply and provision of staff from abroad could only begin if the disaster area was declared a national disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
“ It is still a disaster at the provincial level, ” noted Aulia Arriana, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says "All right, this is a national disaster," we can take international assistance, but this status is not yet granted."
The second night, after a Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who have not yet been found, were still hoping that the arrival of their loved ones would be a miracle that would adorn these grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers received a woman who lay for two days under stone with her mother’s body nearby.
Hendon Subandono, a trainer in the Indonesian national paraplaneerism team, trained two missing paraplanists to participate in the Asian Games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanists who fell into the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandahi, were his disciples.
“ As senior paraplanerism, I have my emotional burden, ” he said.
Mr. Hendon relates how a few hours after news of the destruction of the Roy Roa Hotel, which had spread to the paraplanetary community, he desperately sent messages to the General App to Palm rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with just one gray check mark, not with double blue ticks.
“ I think that means no messages have been delivered, ” he said.
The thieves took $26,750, while filling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750, from a Brink worker who was running a bank card on the Levee, reports the news to the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment unit and was preparing to add more money, writing Detective Dennis McCarthy in news.
While he was busy, the other man "snuck up behind to a Brink fellow" and stole a bag of money intended to fill.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects fleeing the crime scene on the news, but the police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport Police, number 859-292-3680.
The rapist changes his name to Y.
"Reper Canier West changes his name to Ye."
On Saturday, when he announced the change in Twitter, he wrote, "The sooner is officially known as Kanier West."
The 41-year-old Vesta was called Y, and he used that as a name for his June album.
The change was taking place just before he appeared on the Sunday Night Live show, where he expected to introduce his new Jundi album.
On the show, he replaces Arian Grande's singer, who cancelled her participation because of “emotional causes”, said the author of the show.
This is not just a reduction of the modern professional name, before West had said that it had religious meaning for him.
“ I believe that it is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” said West at the beginning of this year, discussing the title of his album with the Bogue Radio.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanya, which means "one", has been reduced to just y -- it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
Kanya is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Kombs, formerly known as Paff Diddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that they chose the name Love and Braser Love.
A former colleague of Weste, JAE-ZI, also experimented with defis and capital letters.
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico promises not to use an army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised never to use an army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the student massacre.
On Saturday, Lopes Obrador promised "never to use an army to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shot a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people, and at that time left - handed student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and by opening more free government universities.
He noted that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities lead young people to criminal gangs.
The US needs to double funding in artificial intelligence
Since China is increasing activity in artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount they spend on research in this field, says investor and practitioners in the Ci Kai-Fou Lee field, who worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were given after the different parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the United States has no formal strategy at all in the area of AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it wants to become No. 1 by the year 2030 in the area of II.
“A double budget for the AI study would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in the AI, ” said Lee.
The doubling of funding can double the probability that the next great achievement in the II field will be made in the U.S., said Lee in the CIBC interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The Nations of the AI: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hoggton Microflin Harturt, is the director- general of the Sinaving Ventures Foundation, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous companies in the AI in China.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Mello, he was working on the AI system, which played the best American otello player, and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee marked the previous technology competitions conducted by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Callenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when the next would be available to help identify the next prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win the nation’s grants, said Lee.
“It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's a corporation,” he said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring luminaries from universities in recent years to work on AI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policies can also help the U.S. increase efforts in the area of AI.
“I believe that the Green Card should be automatically offered to science candidates in the area of AI, ” he said.
The Chinese Council of State published its Plan for the Development of the New Generation in July 2017.
China's National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding for those who work in academic institutions, just as U.S. National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations give money to American researchers, and the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence centre to engage industry and academic community partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the I Next Initiative.
In the case of the National Science Foundation, it is now investing in a study of the next 100 million dollars a year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create a Commission for National Intellectual Intelligence, took no steps for months.
The Macedonians vote in referendums to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum as to whether to change the country’s name in the Republic of North Macedonia, which would allow a long - term dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia’s possibility of European and NATO membership.
Greece, a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of a northern neighbor is a claim in its territory and vetoed Macedonia’s entry into NATO and the EU.
In June two governments made a deal based on the proposed new name, but the nationalistic opponents of the agreement argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he wouldn't vote in a referendum, and a boycott campaign had raised doubts about whether the minimum 50 per cent voters would reach the conclusion that would allow for a referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the ballot paper is, "Do you support NATO and EU membership under agreement with Greece? "
Supporters of a change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, state that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for the introduction of bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they may live freely under the influence of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us, ” said 79 - year - old Oliver Giorgiewski in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is without legal obligations, enough members of Parliament said they would support it to make it decisive.
It's going to take two thirds of the vote in Parliament to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission stated that by 1100 there had been no reports of violations.
But there was only 16% of the last parliamentary election, compared to 34% in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters threw their ballots into the gates.
“I have come to vote for the sake of my children, our place in Europe,” declared a 62-year-old Gouze Tanevsky voter in the capital city of Skopje.
On September 30th, 2018, in Stormica, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Doskoh gave their vote in a referendum on the change of the name of the country, which will open the way for the accession to NATO and the European Union.
Before Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and set up a chair in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to come up there with a proud head, not through a service door, ” Kavardarikov stated.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaire believes that NATO membership will bring a lot of needed investment in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will vote because more than 80 per cent of our citizens speak in favour of the EU and NATO, ” said Zavé after the vote.
He pointed out that the result of yes would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia, 30 to 43 percent of the voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required conclusion.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telema, 57 percent of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be valid, it has to be 50% plus one vote.
The fall on the referendum will be the first serious blow to the politics of the western government since the beginning of its work last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passing the whole Briton defense and killing the nude.
Sergio Aguero and Rachim Sterning took over the Brayton Defence and brought Manchester City with an account of 2-0 on Saturday at Etijad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Goll Aguero at 65 minutes of the match looked funny.
The Argentine attacker was given a pass in the center of the field at the start of a sequence.
It ran between the three Briton's supporters and found itself in an open field.
Then Aguro realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He walked across one defender, then ran a few more over the edge of the Brighton fine.
He then made a pass to the left when he saw him.
The English Forvard made the first touch of a fine to give Aguero's ball, which, in its right van, launched it into the right side of the gate, defeating the Briton needle Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet, ” said the manager Pep Guardioll, a journalist.
We agreed he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that he had a needle at this moment."
But the original preference for the celestial blues in this Prime League match was for Stern.
That goal happened at 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep in Briton's territory.
He sent a beautiful entryway along the left flank of Leroy Sana.
Leroy made a couple of touches and then made pass Stern in the direction of the far trouser.
The sun's blue-blanched beard threw the ball at the gate just before he jumped off the border.
Citi will meet Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League at 12:55 a.m. at Reyn Nekkar Arena Stadium in Zensheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to take points from Rocky.
Since Washington Washingtons came out of the play-off, there was no real reason to wait for another start.
But Scherzer's competitive expectation is to go to a sandbox's bitter Sunday match against "Colodo Roquis" on the condition that "Roquis" will still have difficulty getting into the play-off. Now Roquis is on one game ahead of Los Angeles Dogers in the National League of the West.
Rockis has at least a WildCard for victory with an account of 5-2 over Nasionles on Friday evening, but still trying to secure the title of the first division.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to leave the ball, knowing how the audience here is doing in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I've seen in the whole year.
Why don't I want to get involved in this competition?
Nasionols will still be declared who will be the start-up on Sunday, but they are reported to bow down to be Scherzer.
Sherzer, for whom it's going to be the 34th start, on Thursday, he's taken off the pizza Sea and can play on Sunday, his usual exit.

Trumps in West Virginia
The President briefly referred to the situation around his candidate before the Supreme Court of Brettt Kavano, when he spoke about the importance of Republican followers in the medium-term elections.
“All we did will be put on a map in November.
In five weeks there will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big -- I don’t run, but I’m really running, so I’m fighting for the great candidates everywhere I can, wherever I can, ” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible, radical group of democracies, you see this happening right now.
And they're firmly committed to regaining power, using whatever means, you see a meanness, a trick.
They don't care who's suffering from them, who's going to go through to get power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them."
A mission of democracy, he said, to resist and obstruct.
“And you see this during the last four days, ” he said, calling the democracies “wicked and mean, disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee, calling Senator Dian Feinsinte, by name, which caused the audience to hear the loud cries of dissatisfaction.
"Remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- that was really the bad language of the bodies -- the worst language of the bodies I've ever seen."
The Leborist Party is no longer an extensive church.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was hardly a surprise.
In the end, I'm the last member of Parliament to be told that they're not happy, and that's all because we're expressing our opinion.
Joan Ryan, a member of my Parliament, was treated almost the same way because she stood firm against anti - Semitism.
I was sentenced to disagree with Jeremy Corbin.
As to the importance of responsible economic policies, of national security, of Europe, these are ironically like those where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East conference on Friday says, "We want meetings to be intrusive and productive."
Most of the evening meetings of the General Committee during my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Leborists were like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of a “more kind, more soft” policy has long been forgotten, if ever begun.
It's becoming increasingly evident that there are no different views in the Labour Party, and each thought is evaluated from the position of whether it's acceptable for the party's leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues that I thought I had once thought were political views were beginning to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept a position that I would never agree with, be it national security or the only EU market.
Always when I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- there's a series of social networking attacks that's followed by calls for revoking, condemnation of the politics of the center, they tell me that I don't have to be in the Leborist Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that I'm looking at are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face flows of sexist or racist attacks, but never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse are the norm.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer a large church, and with every movement of doubt, the party's selection rules narrow down.
Over the last two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been encouraged not to hang out, not to talk so loudly, so that I'm "all right."
But I didn’t come into politics.
I joined a high school student 32 years ago because, because of the lack of attention from the government, Tetcher, my high school class has been just falling apart, and I've been trying to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether they're a local adviser or a minister of government.
I've never hidden my policy, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East was puzzled by my political views and differences with my present leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday events, I just want to say one thing: in a situation where the country is going to Brexite, which is going to harm households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leyboratory Party.
I actually have another message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, both members of the Labour Party, and no: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to call me back and no political advantage will prevent me from acting according to what I consider to be the best interests of you all.

Air: 38 - 17 "Melose": Unsolved Air rise
Two recent attempts may have distorted the end result, but Air has no doubt earned a triumph in today's wonderful primer's entertainment match, Scotland.
Now, they're taking the lead in the table, which is the only unconquerable ten team.
After all, the great defense and the improved ability to use the chance gives the householder and coach Peter Merchi the full right to be content.
“ So far we have been tested by our games, and we are still unconquerable, so I have to be content, ” he said.
Robin Christy of the Melose commented, "I give them credit for Eir," they used better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt at 14 minutes, implemented by Frasier Climo, led Air forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, published by Verriors, allowed "Melrose" to show figures, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Climo reinforced Air's leadership by using the Mainty and made and implemented a solo test right before the break, after which he gave the account 17-5 to Air for the benefit of Eir
But the Meloses did well with the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a lasting delay due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, which was carried out from the field on the legs, and from the Air restaurant, it came forward with an attempt by Stafford McDawell, who was implemented by Climo.
Captain Blair McFerson had a yellow card at the time, and once again the Melrose forced another player to pay an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin under intense pressure.
The gentlemen returned, however, when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to intercept Climo without a ball from the line of the fine course, McFerson took a tapdown behind Air.
Climo implemented the attempt he was doing almost every time after the restaurant, then Kyle Row received a blow from David Armstrong in the box and sent the flanger Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the master's team.
Looks like the star of All Game is set up for a new career in the restaurant.
Looks like Ford Kiran's star of "All Game" is set up for a new career in the area of hospitality, and that's what we can conclude after it has become known that he's the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor is playing Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC TV series that he writes and that he's filming with Greg Hemfield's old comedy partner.
Duet announced that the next ninth series would be the last one in the series, and apparently Cyrnan's plans for life after Craigling.
According to the official record, he is the director of the company Adrichhorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source of the Skottish Sun indicated that Kirnan wanted to enter the "growing restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"Our world": Intangible Bolivia hopes that the court will open her way to the Pacific
Seamen patrol the fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang the oceanic blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted by the motto: “Our power is right.
We must return it."
In Bolivia, which has no way to go to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coast line that left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century through natural resources, and there is a desire to swim again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is waiting for an international court on October 1st, after five years of trial.
“We have a spirit of unity and peace in Bolivia and, of course, it looks forward to a positive outcome, ” commented Roberto Calsadius, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, and they hope that the Gaazi tribunal will make a decision in favour of Bolivia, that after decades of intriguing Chile will be forced to negotiate a sovereign sea exit by Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his election next year, also looks forward to a decision that will be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision in Bolivia, and if it does, little will change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to condemn Chile's territory and notice that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the decision of the ICJ is only six months after the final arguments have been cited indicates that the case was “not complicated, ” says Pas Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
Bolivia’s business has not moved, and for the past four years, it has been possible to push back.
“The search for access to the sea has been used by the present Bolivian administration, ” said Zarata.
Morales, a militant rhetoric, blew up the remains of Chilean kindness, and she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodriguez Welts, a representative of Bolivia in Gaza, did not agree that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given the “extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationship with Chile and the chance to end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit, ” he said.
He also denied that Morales, one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was still using the marine question as a political mistress.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific, ” he added.
It is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the United States.
Northern Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before Washington can be trusted.
Rie spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during Singapore's summit by the leading rival countries.
His comments appeared when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seemed to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen Inn.
Ri says that belief that the continuation of sanctions and the face of the U.S. Declarations of the end of the Korean War will one day put North Korea on its knees is a “unreal dream”.
Washington, D.C., is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant disarmament steps.
Kim is also the American president, Donald Trump, who wants the second meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the rejection of its arsenal, which the country likely considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phanyan the next month to prepare for the second kim and Trump Summit.
The Paris fashion shows showed the latest trend in the massive major fences that are already on the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or to hide completely from the sun, you've found what you need.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown have shown a number of top-of-the-line estuaries from the 2019 spring-litto collection in the podiums of the brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats filled Instagram this summer, and called designers have already sent their ferocious creations beyond the horizon.
Valentino stood out as an extraordinary escape hat with broad-breasted feathers on the fields, which covered the heads of the models.
Among the other there's the axies decorated with precious watermelons, the sorcerer's hat and even a hat cannasus, but they are not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the range of the original masks — very quickly before Halloween.
Many of these multicolored masks had stitched lips and looked more like Hannibal Lekter than a high fashion.
One creature looked like a underwater swimming gear with a tube and glasses, and another looked like a crack of ice cream that had been melted.
And if you support this serious fashion request, you're lucky.
Stilists say that huge hats can come out on the main streets of your city.
The top-of-the-bee came into fashion thanks to the "Lia Bombie", a straw hat with a six-centimeter wide coat that you saw at all, from the Rianni to Emily Ratajski.
A cartoon brand behind a very impractical hat, which you could see across social networks, gave the world another creation: a straw beach bag the size of almost like a model in a dome that carried it.
A bag of yellow-red ruffiah, with a bacma from the raffia and a white leather handle, was a central element in the collection of La Riveira spring lyto, 2019 Jacquemus brand on the fashion week of Paris.
"On the next summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the designer's influence is so great, it's going to be difficult to ignore the demand for on-is-assuses."
The knowledge of languages is compulsory for citizens of the world.
Independent schools in Scotland maintain high standards of learning, and in 2018 they again obtained excellent results from tests that complemented individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which teach over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SSRS), and seek to provide the best service for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, the careers they choose, and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in the language that he understands, he understands it in his mind.
If you speak to her in her mother tongue, she understands it from the heart.”
It's a powerful reminder that we can't use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's exams show that in independent schools, languages are being valued with the best grades.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received higher A.
The data collected in 74 U.S.H. schools showed that 72% of students received higher A from Chinese, and 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also got A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people, no doubt, will need in the future.
Now, language as a subject is taught in the same way that NMIM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), free school programs, and other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 percent of the reasons employers cannot close the vacancy associated with lack of language skills.
Language skills are thus increasingly needed in preparing young people for a future career.
As language skills are increasingly needed, they are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever your career is, if someone learned the second language, it's going to have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a man with several languages priority over competitors.
According to a 2013 survey of over 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 per cent were not able to speak the language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language where two percent of the population (15 per cent) spoke.
That is why investing in language teaching is important to today’s children.
Learning several languages, especially those in developing countries, will provide children with a better chance of finding a full - time job.
Every school in Scotland will learn its own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will speak languages that are considered to be the most important language for Britain in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest in independent schools, a number of languages can always be chosen to study them with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools strive to create an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to achieve success regardless of what the future holds for them.
Now you can't deny that in the international business environment, language continues to be vital to the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as “acquisitions of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, diversity, and perfection to Scottish youths.
Il faut boen le faire.
John Edward, director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron debuts Lakes in San Diego
Fans who want to see Lebro James for Los Angeles, almost wait.
Lakes coach Luke Walton announced that James would be playing on Sunday in the first front-line match against Dever Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's gonna play, it's not settled yet.
“It's going to be more than one and less than 48,” said Walton on Lakes.
Lakers Reporter Mike Trudll reported that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers Pre-Seas games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-school games to prepare me, ” he replied.
Trumps in West Virginia Channel YouTube
President Donald Trump today starts a series of pre-election meetings in the town of Whiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned next week's Trump meetings, including meetings in friendly states, including Tennessee and Missouri.
The final ballot for the candidature that he has proposed to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump wants to form a support for the upcoming mid-term elections, because the Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What is the hour for today’s Trump Memorial in West Virginia, and how can you see it on the Internet?
A rally of Trump in the city of Uling, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 hours in Eastern times today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online in front of YouTube.
Tramp may refer to the intensive hearing that took place this week, bringing the candidate before the Supreme Court of Brett Cavana, accused of sexual harassment, and postponing the Senate's vote a week while the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
But the main goal of this series of meetings is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November elections.
President Trump's representatives stated that these five meetings the following week were aimed at "activation of volunteers and supporters, because the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand most of what they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," reports Reuters.
“The control over Congress is so critical to its order of affairs that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the race of pre-elections is approaching,” said Reuters of Trump's campaign, who would not want to call his name.
At the Wesbenko Aren Stadium in the town of Whiling today's meeting is open to visitors from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as to the Pitsburg media, reports West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday visit will be the second in the last month on Trump's visit to West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morris, whose rating is behind the polls.
“ It’s not good for Morris that the president comes to raise his scores, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder's cup 2018: The U.S. team is set up to fight, and is looking forward to Sunday singles
After three sessions that ended with a one - way victory, the Saturdays may become exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
The sleek pendulum of pulse is a fully invented sports concept, a concept that players really believe, especially in similar competitions.
So when they say it works?
“They were in front of six points and now at four, so I think we're taking it a little bit like a pulse, ” said Jordan Speth when we walked in.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Speth says, feel a little wind in their sails, and there's a lot of them that encourages, not least, the form of Spita and Justin Thomas, who were playing together all day, and each one earned three points of four.
The sleep with his killer blows from the handmaid to the grave shows an example.
These guttural cries of the celebration became louder when, in continuation of his round, he made a decisive sweat and compared the score to the fourth match after he and Thomas had been suspended by two points.
His sweat, which allowed them to win a 15-hole match, met a similar scream, which tells you that the American team doesn't seem to.
“You really should just try very hard and worry about your own match, ” said Speth.
That's all that each of these players left now.
18 holes to become famous
The only players with more points than Spith and Thomas have over the past two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood — an unquestionable story of the Raider Cup.
A remarkable but charming couple from Europe have four out of four and cannot make any mistakes.
Molwood was the only couple who didn't make the gods on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to avoid the gods on Saturday morning and after lunch on Friday and on the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This race and the way that their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and back, makes them believe that they're winning on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Flitwood or Molinari to secure a potential European victory when the sun hits the Le Holf National.
Both are desired at the same time on different holes.
However, talking about European triumphs is still early.
Boubb Watson and Webb Simpson were divorced by Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning trouts when he was in a couple with Alex Noren.
One godgies and two divas on the first nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swedish to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you to get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to watch the trouts and the trouts, and it's interesting to watch how the strategy can change in a single moment, with the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and it's interesting to see how the strategy can change in a single moment.
Europe is currently playing better than a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this force session has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight what some, especially Americans, are questioning.
Europe is leading an account of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a strong advantage, because after Saturdays and forsows it is ahead of the United States with a 10-6 bill.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari got two wins over the retreating Tiger Woods, and they now have four points on Le Holf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which is trying to recover the trophies that they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning trout with a 3-1 count.
The U.S. had more resistance in the trouts and won two matches, but it couldn't reduce the gap.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday bruises to keep the trophies.
Flitwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, but he and Mollinari (the "Molwood" time) after a sensational weekend is only the second couple to get four points in the first four games in the history of the Raider Cup.
By destroying Wood and Patrick Reed in the porcelain, they united to beat Woods and Brison Deschambo's new American girl with even more effective 5th.
Woods, which pulled out two games on Saturday, demonstrated random outbreaks of genius, but at the moment he had lost 19 out of 29 of his games in forbolas and forsas, and seven of the games in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning trouts, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in the trouts to get a defeat with the 2nd 1 from Justin Johnson and Brooks Copes, which is the first and third in the world rating.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its own way this pleasant, fresh day south-west of Paris.
Three times the chief winner, Jordan Spot and Justin Thomas, set the standard for Americans with their two glasses on Saturday.
They gained a decisive victory over the Spanishmen John Ram and Ian Pauler in troutballs and then beat Pauler and Rory McLroy with 4th in trouts, losing two first holes.
Only twice in the story of the Ryder Cup, the team came back with a four-point deficit in the singles, even though the Furick team just takes night to save the trophies.
However, after a second seat for two days, a Sunday counterattack appears to be out of their power.
North Korea says that “not in any way” will not be disarmed unilaterally without trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions was deepening mistrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that, last year, North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill” such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling a nuclear test site and not distributing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“One thing we don’t see is an appropriate reaction from the United States, ” he said.
“No trust in the United States will be sure of our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no way be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
Even though Ry repeated familiar North Korean complaints about opposing Washington’s “pecular” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for its progress, his application proved to be important in that it did not ignore the unilateral denuclearization that Phanyan had made in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong and Donald Trump's joint statement at first summit in history between the real U.S. President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on the “Dangerousization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised security assurances to the North Korean Peninsula.
North Korea yearns for the formal end of the Korean War between 1950 and 53, but the United States stated that Pyongyang should first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes the calls to weaken the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“U.S. insists on ‘dencation at first’ and raises pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even against ‘the cessation of war’, ” said Ry.
“To think that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream for those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ree didn't mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader emphasized at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mung Jong in the last five months and added: “If the denuclearization issue were to be South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end.”
Despite this, the tone of the Russian speech was very different from that of the primordial, when he told the General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable when Trump called Kim a ‘a missile man' who wants to commit suicide.
This year at the UN Trump, which last year threatened to destroy North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take action on disarmament, but said that much more must be done and sanctions must remain in force for the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday Trump, he didn't set the time limit, "It's two years, three years, or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should be rewarded with the steps taken.
However, U.S. secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue energetically and steadily until we see a complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Rio in the halls of the United Nations General Assembly and then said that the following month he would visit Phanyan again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented on what had been progressed, but a few hours later North Korea sentenced him to the “Gangster demands”.
During a meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promised to remove the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States is taking “responsive measures”.
He said that Kim needed “responsible measures” as security assurances that Trump promised Singapore and steps to normalize its relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are given a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all of its students with more sleep, an attempt to combat the growing culture of high school all night after refueling caffeine.
The teacher found that students at the university are often uneducated in the world when it comes to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chasler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigama Women’s Hospital, had developed a course that he thought was the first in the United States.
He decided to start a course after giving a lecture on the effect of sleeping on learning.
At the end, one girl approached him and said, "Why do they tell me that now, in the last class?
“She told me that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep that surprised me, ” said a teacher in The Telegraph.
The course that was introduced this year first explains how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports outcomes and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the university, explained that the university decided to take a course after it was discovered that students were seriously deprived of sleep for a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one chapter, there are pictures of a room in a dorm room where students click cups of coffee, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the impact of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deficits on sports performances, and the importance of the routine associated with sleep.
Another chapter tells how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The next map of an interactive compass encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that that doesn't change the behavior of students instantly.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of cigarette smoking, ” added Professor Chasler.
The culture of pride for ‘ Not sleeping all night' still exists, he added, and he also pointed out that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is on the rise.
A sufficient sleep of good quality should be a secret weapon for a student to cope with stress, burnout and anxiety, even with a set of unnecessary weight, since sleep deprivation translates the brain into a condition of hunger, which causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chester develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year at Harvard for the first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for all the company.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all post-graduates asking for a similar training program before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chasler recommends that students give reminders about going to bed, as well as putting a alarm alarm alarm, and being aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, and that they may break the circus rhythm that leads to fall-out problems.
Lavingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Hal Mengi upset Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered a further assault of asphyxiation: Dolly Mengi brought an isolated team, Stephen Gerard, defeating account 1-0 from Livingston.
The Aybroxs team wanted to win its first victory at the exit match after the February triumph over St. John's and the account of 4-1, but the Harry Holta failed to defeat Gerard as manager of 18 games.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers warehouse, which lacked inspiration, did not look like it could equal the bill.
Now the Rangers are on position six, and the Luggston are on the third, and at the difference of the balls are only preceded by the Hibernian.
Furthermore, the Rangers may be in another trouble, as the lineman Kalum Spence was forced to handle the head wound after he had been thrown into the guest sector.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that had once passed by the Air in the mid-point of the Scottish League Cup.
And Holt released the same Lavy 11 warehouse, which took one point at Harts last week, and was thrilled by the way his mutilated boys pushed the rivals down at every step.
Maybe Rangers was dominated by a ball, but Luringston worked more with the ball.
They had to kill just two minutes later when the first Mengi Pass into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to strike at the gates of Allan McGreg, but a half-deficient waste this great chance of sending the ball past the gate.
The deep free blow of Keagan Jacobs got the motorner Craig Hallett, but his defense partner Alan Littlego hit the back of his pants.
Rangers actually got control, but the last third had more hope than they had faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he had to be entitled to a toolbar on the mark of a quarter of an hour after the encounter with Stephen Lowes, but the referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian call.
The Rangers managed to make only two hits on the front gate in the first half, but Liam Kelly, the former Ibrox gatekeeper, the head of Lassani Kubili and the peaceful blow of Ovié Ejari, were hardly disturbed.
Although the former Livingston's head may have been in conflict with the game, no one can deny that they only deserve it by their hard work.
The Rangers failed to cope again with Jacob's plan.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Mengu to be a mere end.
In the break, Gerard replaced Kulybali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the Hungarian tried to get Morelos, but an amazing Kelly stuck off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like when Litgo and Halket make one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved the outcome at the last stages, but McGreg was a good counterer to Jacobs before Little hit him from the corner.
Glenn Middlton, replaced by Rangers, made another late claim for a fine when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson returned to his eyes.
Almanac: Geiger 's creator
And now the page from our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the time goes... Germany was born the next physicist, Johann Wilhelm Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as Geiger counter.
Since then, Ghaeger's churches have become a key element in science, as well as a key element in the propagation, for example, in the 1950s "Conado Calling" film with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, which play doubt-based cowboys.
Man: What's all this stuff?
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects on the radioactive atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Well, it's really cutting up now!"
Ghan Geiger died in 1945 just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells
Waccin teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
And then these cells are able to "see" protein, which is shared by a lot of cancers, and then these cells are reentered by the patient.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that teaches an immune system to detect malignant cells has disappeared ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can “see” and then re-entering these cells in a combination of protein cancers (HER2).
Professor Jay Bersefski of the National Cancer Institute of the United States of America, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
“HER2” is associated with the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colossal cancer,” he explained.
A similar approach, namely, to remove immune cells from patients and to “instruct” them to target cancer cells, has worked to treat one of the types of leukemia.
After the presentation of the SNL show in MAGA Kanje West came out with a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
What caused the viewers to react negatively
The audience at the SNL show studio (Sunday night in direct Ethiopian air) was feasted by Kanya after his sad performance, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and claimed to be running for the presidency in 2020.
After the third song, called Ghost Tower, in a baseball box labeled "Let America Return the Former Glory," he exploded with a tyrant in which he criticized the democracies and again declared his support of the Trump.
And the white man says, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I had been concerned with racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
The SNL began with Matt Damon’s skate, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Britta Kavano’s testimony to the Senate Legal Committee in the case filed by Christine Blaise Ford about sexual assault.
Although West's speech wasn't broadcast live on the air, the video with his title was put on social media by Chris Rock.
Whether Roque wanted to ridicule West by putting it into this position is not clear.
West also complained to viewers that he had had an unpleasant situation behind him because of his head covering.
The West stated, "When I was behind the scenes, I was treated rudely.
They said, "Don't go to the audience in this baseball."
They were fucking me!
And then they tell me that I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
West kept saying, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are quiet, and I'll put on my superman baseball, because that's how no one can tell me what to do, and you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat one another with love."
According to a weekly newspaper in Variety, his comments were, at least twice, a negative response from the audience in the room, and the SNL actors were like lost, and one of the audience said, "The studio was full of dead silence."
The West was invited to replace Arian Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before the air.
The West called for surprise by doing song I Love it in a suit of water bottles Perrier.
West supported TPUSA Conservative Organization Kendez Turner, who wrote in Twitter, "One of the dumbest: I'm out of the way.
Karen Gather, the world leader of the Tok show, wrote on Twitter that the West is what it is, and that's just great.
"Just I won't reward him (buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) who, I think, is practicing and fanning an ideology that is damaging to my community.
He's a free man.
She added.
Before the show, the rapist announced in Twitter that he changed his name, and now he's "who used to be known as Canier West."
West is not the first artist to change his name, but he follows the example of Diddy, also known as Paff Diddy, Paffy, and Pip Diddy.
The trade-reper Snoop Dogg used to be called Snoop Lyon, and it's known that the music legend of recent decades, Prince, changed its name to a symbol, and then became "Artist, formerly known as Prince."
Charged of attempted murder after an attack with a knife at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with a attempted murder after another man has been stabbed in one of the East Belfast restaurants on Friday.
Police reported that the incident was at the Belliguecamore Restaurant.
The accused is expected to stand before the Belfast Magistrates on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating the charges.
Kit Guerington's "Groe of the thrones" star condemns the idealization of brutality
Cat Herington became famous for the role of a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval phentesium series "Groe of thrones" of production of HBO.
But 31-year-old performances denouncing macho stereotypes, claiming that these heroes on screen often make young guys feel like they have to become cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture of China, he said that he thought something went wrong and asked how to solve the problem of the idealization of brutality in the hashtag era of #MeTo Tékékékéké, #age and so on.
A cat who recently married a member of his throne gardener, a 31-year-old actress, Rose Leslie, noted that he is “smartly determined” to deal with this problem.
When we came to a slippery path of idealizing brutality, he asked.
"Why do we teach future men to look at their adulthood in terms of the problem we see now?"
China believes that television is partly responsible for spreading brutality through images of extremely brave heroes.
He went on to say, "What is natural, and what are we going to plant?
Why can we teach television and street that young boys feel pressured to be such men?
I think today is really a big question, "How do we change this?
'Cause it's obvious that young guys are lost the way they're going."
In an interview, he also said that he wouldn't do anything in the prequerel and the gravy of the thrones, after he finished showing the show of the series next summer, because he'd done away with the battles and the horses.
From November, China will play in production of Sam Shephard's Right West's play stories about the movie producer and his brother-in-law.
As the actor recently confessed, he respects seeing his wife Rose as the best he has received from the series "The Temple of the thrones."
"In the course of this series, I met my wife, and he gave me a gift to the family and defined my future life," says Kit.
In a Phentesian show that won "Ammy", Rose played Ygritt -- the love of hero Gerington John Snow.
The couple got married in June of 2018, and the ceremony was held on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a sharp increase of 14% in new cases of HIV/AIDS
In China, 14 percent of the population with HIV and AIDS reported a sharp increase.
Health officials reported that there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, indicating a change in the past.
For a long time, HIV has been spread rapidly through infected blood in certain parts of China during transfusions.
But, according to official health officials at a conference in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of HIV / AIDS patients in China grew by 100,000.
HIV transmission over time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT society is often discriminated against.
According to the study, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men marry women in the future because of the rule of conservative values in the country.
Most of the transmission is due to improper use of protective devices during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free access to HIV drugs, seeing that this is part of the solution.
Maxine Voters denies the leaking data of the senators to the network by her full-time employee and exposes the harsh criticism of "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy."
On Saturday, Maxine Voters, a U.S. House of Representatives, denounced allegations that one of her staff had posted personal records of three U.S. senators on their pages in Wikipedia.
Democracy from Los Angeles says that these claims are spreading "ultrarights" by political observers and websites.
"Break, lie, and then even more disgusting lies," Watts said in Twitter.
The published information reportedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hetch of Utah.
The data appeared on a Thursday, and they were placed by an unknown person with the Capitolia during a hearing in the Senate board on charges of sexual misconduct against Brettt Kavano, a candidate for the position of a U.S. Supreme Court judge.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavano.
The Hill reported that conservative websites, such as the Peopleway Pundit and RedState, had information that the IP address of the source was linked to the Westers office and was able to find data from her full-time co-worker.
"These unfounded claims are absolute lies, they don't fit the reality," said Walters.
"The staff member of my office whose personal data and safety are threatened by these fabricated and lying statements has nothing to do with the origin of this information.
These unfounded statements are absolute lies, they don't fit the reality."
Waters' application was quickly criticized online, and among others was former White House press secretary Ary Fleicher.
"This denial is full of anger," wrote Flyscher.
"It suggests that, with such a character, she may not be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not get angry.
The accused should not act presumptuously.
He should not ask for the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and unresolved."
Looks like Fleischer led parallels between that of Walters and that of a democratist at Judge Kavano's address, who was accused of being too angry to listen to on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for Waters' seat, also expressed his opinion in Twitter.
"This is so news, if all is true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had already reported "regarded government bodies and law and order bodies about these false claims."
"We will do everything we can to make the guilty find," she continued, "and they answered the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
An overview of the Agent Johnny Inglish: New Mission – a passage parody for spy fighters with Rown Atkinson
It's already a good tradition to look for in every new British film, the Brexit, and there's a new part of a series of comedy parodys in a fight about Johnny Ingles, and the first film called "Jonny Ingles" came out on screen in 2003, later the series was re-established in 2011, with "Johnny Ingles: Restarting."
Will it become a mocking and ironic self-government of what we are, the new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny Inglesch, with his moving face and his testamental eyes, was given the opportunity to do some messy things, and his name more than anything else indicates that this comical character was created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is a sloppy, cheery secret agent, who, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, is a little bit from the Clozo inspector, a little bit from Mr. Benn and a lot of stuff from that guy who played one note of the sound of the fire chariot movie at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The character is also foreshadowed by the traveler and the mystery of the international scale, which has always been behind the disorder that Atkinson once played in the long - forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard.
In the last film about Johnny Inglesha, there are some good points.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglish was approaching the helicopter in court, and the blades of the screws were popping about his helmet.
In the film, Atkinson's talent is well discovered, but it's kind of assailant, and in some cases too much of it, especially when it's compared to "serious" movies, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission is not possible," which is also a comedy.
It seems that jokes are calculated for children rather than adults, and I find the ridiculous assaults that Johnny Inglesch is having, they don't seem as resourceful and thoughtful as Atkinson's dopes in dumb bean movies.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
In Britain’s top secret network of spies, hackers infiltrate the names of all the field agents, which is a surprise for the acting agent (maturely, Kevin Eldon played the movie only as an episodic role).
This turned out to be the last drop for the Prime Minister, a proud person who has already experienced devastating criticism and who is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity.
Intelligence advisers informed her that all active agents were compromised and she had to get some retired.
The choice falls on Johnny Inglesch, who now works as a teacher at a superdominary institution and is not officially teaching children to work under cover (in this part with the spy yearline Inglych was a few good jokes).
They are quickly taken to Whitehol for urgent briefing, where he meets again with Ben Miller, his wealthy friend Baf, who plays Ben Miller for a second time.
Baf is now married to the captain of the submarine.
So when everything in the Secret Service of her Majesty went straight, Batman and Robin came back in line and suddenly met the fatal woman Ofelia Pistoletov, who's playing Olga Curielenko.
And at that time, the prime minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who's made his fortune in technology and technology and who says he can solve the problem with the British network, the evil Jason Volt, who was played by Jake Lacey.
Higgish and Baf are on their way and again acting on their ridiculous scooters: dressed by waitressers, they fire at a fancy French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally driving abroad to the magnificent Volta boat; the Ingles arranges for a real mess when they try to use a helmet of virtual reality to get a look at the planning of Volta's house.
All the stops lead us to the final episode, but by their kindness and violence, it resembles a movie for children.
It's a movie that's going on.
As I was watching other movies about Johnny Inglesha, I asked myself the same question: Can the British film industry really not offer Rown Atkinson a role that really corresponds to his talent?
Leibbyists are refusing to prepare a plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but they're going to get paid in five days.
The Leborist Party, Jeremy Corbina, has to discuss a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid in five days.
It's reported that the party wants to commit the executives of the companies to transfer money saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence to the workers, giving them an additional exit.
So the workers will have a three-day day off and they'll be bringing home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea would correspond to the party's economic program and direct the country's resources to support the labor class.
Going to a four-day work week was approved at the British Congress of Tremnion, and it's said to be possible for the workers to benefit from a change in the overall economic situation.
The source of the Labour Party reported The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
It won't change overnight, but the idea of a four-day work week is the party's approach to changing the balance of economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Leyborists didn't get the idea first, because the Green Party promised to have a four-day job week on the election campaign in 2017.
However, not all members of the Leborist Party at the moment approve of such a desire.
The Speaker of the Labour Party said, "The party's political program doesn't have a four-day work week, so now we don't look at this."
The "Cind" chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the Leborist Party election last week.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was willing to take back the power of the community's `discreet directors' and the `discipliners'.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that shareholders of water supply companies may not get their whole share of the capital if the Labour government takes an "calculation" on the basis of the alleged disruptions.
He also confirmed his intention to include employees in company management and to create introductory equity funds to transfer 10% of the usual private sector corporate shares to workers waiting for annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are talking at 60 Minutes (60 minutes) or can the Cavanano investigation, which is led by the FBI, change their opinion
In connection with the investigation into charges against Judge Britta Kavano, which is led by the FBI, the final ballot for his appointment as judge of the Supreme Court is postponed by at least a week, and there is a question whether the senators in the Republic will continue to support the Kavano after the results of the Bureau's investigation are published.
In a Sunday 60 Minutes show, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the public senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that changed their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
'Yes, of course,' said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Kavano.
I called him after everything happened and the charges came out, asked him, "Did you really do it?"
He was determined, determined, uncomposed."
It seems that Graham’s point of view will not change anything.
"I believe that the charge against Cavano is a provocation," he said.
Dr. Forde, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied everything,' added Graham, turning to Christine Blaise Ford.
And anyone whom she calls cannot confirm it under oath.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can change."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
On this Saturday, New York will host the Global Cities Festival, which is an annual event in the music world with an amazing number of star performers and no less striking missions to fight poverty around the world.
During the seventh Global Cities Festival, tens of thousands of people will crowd in the Great Gallery of the Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, and to draw attention to the true purpose of the festival — organizers seek to overcome extreme poverty by the year 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Government Project, an international community organization that expects to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to pay the VIP ticket), visitors have to do a bunch of tasks or "acts," like learning from a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to a world leader, making a telephone call or anything else to help bring to the attention of the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So, are there any results, since global Citizen’s organizers have 12 years left to reach their goal?
Is it really the idea of giving a free concert -- a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "cilitism," where people feel that they are actually changing things by signing an electronic petition or by making a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million "works" of their supporters to achieve different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to declare planned financial assimilations and programs worth more than $37 billion, which by the year 2030 will help to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 financial obligations and public applications as a result of its activities, with at least 10 billion already being collected and spent.
The group estimates that some 649 million people worldwide have been directly affected by the cost.
The Power of Nuthrion Foundation, which is territorially related to Britain, has committed itself to helping the children grow and pledged $35 million to help Rwanda overcome malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Cities.
"With the support of the British government, the Mecanates, the governments of other countries and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history," said the representative of The Power of Nutresy Willman, speaking to the public at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "works" that called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced a funding allocation for the "Pouer of Nutria" project aimed at improving the diet of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the widespread questions on your website, "Why do you think you can fight the extremes of poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote, "That's a long and difficult way, so sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like members of civil rights movements and against apartheid, we're going to succeed, because together we're stronger."
Janet Jackson, the group The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Gianll Mona is only part of this year's star performers who will perform the festival in New York City, and will lead it to Deborah La Ferenness and Guy Jacks.
The Minister of Internal Affairs stated that the United States could use naval forces to prevent the export of Russian energy.
According to the U.S. secretary of internal affairs Ryan Zinke, at Washington Examineer, "as necessary", Washington can seek assistance from the Navy to prevent Russian energy from coming to the market, including the Middle East.
Zinke stated that Russia's involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it's acting on an invitation from a legitimate government, is a reason to explore new power plants.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to be the energy broker, as they're already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means of solving the problem.
"Thanks to the U.S. Navy may ensure the free passage by sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the Westerners, which was hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that described itself as the “voice of each consumer” in the United States.
He then compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, saying that they are actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we effectively use energy and replace it with alternative," he said, calling Russia "one-way development," because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While the claims were being heard, Trump’s administration set the goal of increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe, evicting Russian energy from the market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To that end, the Trump Administration and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the "dangerous" project of the "Northern Stream 2" project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin the hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the lawn of "North Flow 2", with a cost of $11 billion and double the capacity of existing carbon dioxide to 110 billion cubic meters, is an entirely economic project.
The Kremlin suggests that Washington vehemently opposes the project for economic reasons only, which is an example of dishonest competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," stated Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak after meeting U.S. Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction by Germany, which confirmed its support of the project.
The German leading organization, the Federal Union of the German Industry (BDI) encouraged the United States not to become involved in EU energy policies and bilateral arrangements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when the third country meddles in our supply of energy," states Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federal Union of the German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, in Massachusetts, "well think seriously" about running for the presidency in 2020
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "really think" about running the presidential post after mid-election.
During a public meeting in Golitok, Massachusetts, Worren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of taking up her candidature.
As reported in The Hill Warren, "there is a time for women to go to Washington to get a job government, and for that, there must be a woman in his head."
"After November 6th, I'll think seriously about bringing my candidature to the presidency."
During a public meeting, Warren expressed her appreciation to the President of Donald Trump, stating that he "will lead his country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Worren was frank, critical of Trump’s appointment to the position of Justice of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanano.
In a Friday tweet, Warren wrote, "...unquestionably, the FBI has to conduct an investigation before the FBI vote."
However, according to a survey published on Friday, the majority of Warren's voters don't think she should run for election in 2020.
According to a survey conducted jointly by the Saffolk Centre for Political Research and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts have spoken against the removal of the senator.
Thirty - two percent supported the drying.
The survey indicated that the former Governor, Deval Patrick, had more support than ever, and 38 percent were able to raise him to the presidency, compared to 48 percent.
In a discussion of the candidates of other prominent democracies who might run for election in 2020, the former Vice-President Joe Baiden and senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders are also called.
According to Associated Press, Byden announced that he would make a decision until January.
Sarah Peylin mentions PTSD Treka Peylin at a meeting in support of Donald Trump.
Trek Payin spent a year in Iraq after he joined the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, an incident that occurred on Monday night.
"What my son's going through right now, what he's going through on his return, can only be understood by other families who are suffering from the effects of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers come home from," she said to the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Peylin called Treck's arrest a problem that nobody cares about and said that her son and other war veterans are "re going home different from what they used to be, more violent, and want to know if there's any respect for what their soldiers, pilots and other military personnel have done for this country."
Treka was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, the head of the police department of Vasilla, and charged with domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as his preventing reports of violence and carrying weapons in an alcoholic state.
18 states and districts in Colombia support a complaint against asylum policies
The 18 states and districts of Colombia are supporting a test of the new U.S. policy by which victims of banditry and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to the NBC News, 18 states and district representatives sent an analytical note to a court consultant in Washington to support a call that required shelter and appealed against the policy mentioned.
The full name of the Grace v. Sessen lawsuit against the American Union for Civil Rights, which has been challenged by federal politics and which was filed in August, is not exposed.
The plaintiff said that her partner "and his cruel son-banned" were beating her, but her U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally held in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting the Grace lawsuit stated that residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (who often request asylum in the United States) often face serious problems such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy repeals the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board’s decision that would allow immigrants without documents that were running from domestic violence to seek shelter.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, General Carl Reussin, stated during his statement on Friday that the new policy "has ignored decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that a decision on an application for refugee status be based on a review of the facts and circumstances of the application, and the prohibition violates this principle”; an analytical note by a consultant of the court.
Then, in an analytical note, prosecutors argue that policy that prohibits immigrants from entry into the United States is damaging to the economies of the country, because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill needed labour resources."
In June, Attorney - General Jeff Seshns issued a decree for immigration judges saying that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
"Principles are given to persons who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with race, religion, nationality, membership in certain social groups or political views," Ssets declared during the presentation of the policy on June 11.
The purpose of asylum was never to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescue workers desperately try to find the survivors, while the number of deaths in Palau is twice as high as the number of deaths.
For those who survive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with fever at the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palau.
"Every minute quick help brings the bodies.
Clean water is not enough."
Some have returned to their devastated homes and have taken underground belongings, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals were damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some injured, including two Geris with a back and shoulder fracture, are resting outside the army hospital building of Palu, where patients are provided with help under open skies because of repeated pushes.
His eyes filled with tears as he remembered how a strong push shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I've been locked up in the wreckage of the wall," said Geriz to correspondent Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife beg for help, and then I calmed down.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador charges China for "extreme psychological pressure" by means of "advertising ads"
A week after the Chinese government newspaper posted an advertising material on four pages of America’s daily magazine on the mutual benefit of US - China trade, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump of the United States last Wednesday was sent to China Daily's Daily News, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, after being accused by China of attempting to influence the elections to Congress on November 6, and China rejects these accusations.
According to Reuters, U.S. officials report that Trump’s statements accusing Beijing of attempting to intervene in American elections mean a new escalation phase on the part of Washington, the goal of which is to pressure China.
Although foreign governments can place advertisements to promote trade, there is a time-bound expansion of the commercial war between Beijing and Washington, D.C., where they have already increased their import customs.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of a repressive tax in China had little intention of attacking exporters from such states as Iowa who supported the Republic of the Trumpa.
Terry Brenstead, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa State, the largest agricultural exporter to China, claimed that China had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in a Sunday-day column of Des Mains Register, "enhancing pressure by publishing propaganda advertising in our independent press."
"To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and independent press to place a pay-as-you-go ad in the Des Mains Register," wrote Brenstead.
"In contrast, on street layouts here in Beijing, you'll only find individual voices of dissidents, and you won't see here the true representation of what the Chinese people really think about is the development of the Chinese economy, which is disturbing, where you can conclude that the media in China is under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "One of the respected Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but didn't say what it was.
Analysts warn that the Republicans are setting up women voters against intermediate elections by failing with Cavanano
Since many well - known Republicans support and protect the candidate for the presidency of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavano after he has been charged with sexual harassment, analysts warn that this could lead to an unwelcome reaction before the upcoming elections, especially by women.
Around this situation passions prevail, and most Republicans publicly state that they would like to turn to the vote.
You can't just play things like that back," said during an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Ringer, School of Political Science Professor Maxwell Syracuse University.
Riger expressed doubt that the FBI investigation, on which, at the last minute, Senator Jeff Flake (Republicist of Arizona), had insisted, would be enough to calm the angry voters.
As reported in "Washington, D.C.", the chief adviser and spokesman of the progressive MoveOn group (Wish Next) Catherine Jean-Pierre on Friday said, "Women won't forget what happened yesterday; they won't forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning, the protestors were singing "Lost coming on!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move on to the confirmation of Cavano's candidature, despite Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's testimony.
In an interview with Stew Rotenberg's news website, a non-partisan political observer, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They say it is now, and it's true.
However, motivation may increase, especially in women voters between 18 and 29 years of predominance who have not yet been identified and often do not vote if they do not like the president."
Before Ford testified on charges of a candidate for a Supreme Court judge's position in sexual crime, analysts had predicted a negative reaction by the voters if the Republicans insisted on confirmation.
Earlier this week, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, said, "It's an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
According to a news channel interview, Mr. Priories USA (United States Capitalities) Guy Cecil, "it's a matter not of voting on a committee, final vote or of Kavano sitting on the dock of the defendants, but of how they responded and how they acted."
But the American thinking about who the evidence is, Ford or Cavanaugh is split up, and a little bit more support is given by Ford.
According to a new survey from YouGOV, 41% of respondents believe or believe in Ford's testimony, while Kavano believes or believe more than 35% of those surveyed.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that they thought Kavano had or were likely to give a false testimony, while Ford had said the same thing about 30 percent of the respondents.
According to The Guardian, after Flake’s urges, the FBI conducts investigations into charges against Ford and another lender, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week Ford testified under oath to the Senate Legal Committee on how Cavano attacked her while intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court's judge's candidate showed her his genitals at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The Internet's inventor is planning to launch a new Internet to create a Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Li, the inventor of the Internet, runs a new startup to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the world's technology legend, Inrupt, is developing an open source platform with a Berners-Li concept.
With a Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and who to access information.
In an exclusive interview, Fast Company Berners-Li joked that the goal of Inrupt is "world domination."
'We must do it now,' he said about the startup.--
This is a historical moment."
Solid technology is used to allow users to create personal online data storage or POD.
It can store contact lists, lists of current operations, calendars, an audio library, and other tools for its own use and operation.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify in one browser at a time.
A unique feature of this personal online repository of data is that it fully meets the needs of the user, who can access any information.
The company calls it "the extension of personal capabilities using data."
According to Director General John Bruce, the company has the goal of involving resources, processes and appropriate skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Li, Bruce, the IBM security platform, several full-time developers hired for the project, and volunteer communities.
Since this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't negotiate with Facebook and Google about if they should be completely replaced when all their business models are undergoing radical changes in a short time period.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday's publication on Midium Berners-Li, it was written that the mission of Inrupt was "to protect commercial energy and the ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet by establishing a Consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Li's a powerful figure in the debate about network neutrality in the last few months.
Even at the time of the launch, Inrupt Berners-Li remained the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Wide Web, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebrations for the service of the Church of Victoria Cross during World War I
The only member of the Church of England who got the Order of "The Cross of Victoria" for taking part in the fighting during World War I is venerated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Wann was awarded to participate in a ride under Bel England and Leocour on September 29, 1918.
However, he died of a sniper bullet four days later and never learned that he had received Britain’s highest military reward.
On Saturday two of his grandchildren discovered a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rashden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vane, called the "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather made the feat for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vane transferred his battalion across the St. Katen Canal, "the matter is very thick fog and under dense fire of Polish cannons and machine guns."
Later, he hurried to the fire and with a "crazed bravery" led his way forward, before which one broke into the gun of the field and destroyed three enemy subunit cannons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little over a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vane said that his grandfather did what he himself would never have done and that he deserved respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Vane put a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Federal Youth Bond.
Michael Vane said he was "very proud of having participated in this parade," and he added that "the real hero's courage is demonstrating the honor that so many people express to him."
Fans MMA didn't sleep all night watching Bellator 206 tours, but instead they were shown "Serka Pepud."
Imagine that you are awake all night just to watch the balator 206 event, and you are denied the opportunity to watch the main event.
There were 13 fights in the Athens of San José, including six of the main programs broadcast live-in at night in Britain on 5 channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, just before Hegard Musa and Rory MacDonald were preparing to come together in the afternoon, the British television viewers died out of wonder when the Peppa pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the battle.
Some viewers were not thrilled because they had not slept until the morning, waiting for a fight.
One of the fans wrote in Twitter that switching to children's cartoon seemed to him "some kind of a bad joke."
"In accordance with the government's decision of content, which was broadcast at six o'clock in the morning, it was inappropriate, so they were forced to have a baby transmission," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and public relations with Bellator when he was asked about television,
"Peppa pig," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Coker promised to work on the broadcasts schedule so that the viewers in Britain too could be caught in the future.
"I think in terms of repeats, we can make it happen," said Coker.
"Now it's Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can't do anything until we're Sunday, and they've got Monday.
But that's what we're working on.
Believe me, when the broadcasts were off, we had a lot of messages that we answered, and the text was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to eliminate it.
However, it turned out to be a conflict of governmental rules.
I can promise you that it won't happen again.
We're going to cut the tournament to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we've been trying to send a signal to the fans, but we've delayed these attempts so far.
It's a really bad situation."
Disert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation.
Tom Dale, the Olympic jumper, tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize "not all look like him" until he went to high school.
In his contribution to the Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Laurent Laver, he noted that he openly expressed the rights of gays to give hope to others.
He also stated that because of his fatherhood, he was less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The long - held chairman of the program, Kirsti Young, went to the hospital for a few months.
When he came in as a couple for Laver's first program, Dale said he felt "the worst" over others as a kid, because "the society didn't get the sense of when boys and girls liked him."
He said, "To this day, the sense of inferiority and difference was exactly what gave me strength and strength to succeed."
He said that he was trying to prove that something was "worth" so that he wouldn't be disappointed by all of those who eventually learned about his orientation.
Two times the bronze Olympian prize became known as the LBGT Community and took advantage of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was honest about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and he wanted to give that hope to others.
The world’s three - time champion admitted that his feelings for a man, American filmmaker Dastin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, were a surprise.
Dalee got married to an Oscar Prize winner, 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you're going through so many things at such a young age," (in the first Olympic Games, he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his own age who's also experienced the same heights and falls.
In June, a son came into marriage called Robert Reys Black Delhi, and ever since, according to Dale, his "light perception" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd think only of getting the gold," he said.
"You know what, there are things far more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept the idea of the end and asked before he died if they bought tickets on the London Olympics in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you're not going to sit in the front row because you're not going to be around," Dale said.
"I held him by the arm when he stopped breathing; and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not inconsolable," he said.
The following year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and obtained bronze.
"I knew that this was what I'd been dreaming of all my life: diving before my countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no feeling of any better than that," Dale said.
This feeling also inspired him to select his first song – Proud (Gordium) in the execution of Hyzer Smol – which was to reason with him as he prepared for the Olympic Games and still causes ants.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 an English summer.
On Saturday, Michaelson, who was out of the shape of the "Raider's Cub."
American Phil Mickelson is supposed to set a record Sunday by playing his 47th game on Ryder's Cup, but he has to re-establish the form so he won't be unhappy.
Micelson, who participates in the 12th record, once every two years, from the game of Captain Jim Furick on the occasion of the conduct of the trouts and forsams.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained in the side, hoping to control emotions.
Because Michelangelo wasn't famous for good strikes, even while he was on the top of his career, a 48-year-old athlete wasn't quite suitable for a tough golf field, Le Holf Nationale, where a raff is usually being punished for wandering strikes.
And if the field's not that bad, then on Sunday, in the ninth match, Michaelson will have to meet a champion of the Open Championship and a master of the exact blow of Francesco Molinari, who won all his matches this week in a couple with a new guy, Tommy Flatwood.
If Americans with three points behind 12 solitary games start well, Michaelson's match can be decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his athlete, and he probably had nothing to add to it.
"He understood his role this morning, patted me on my back, hugged me, and said that tomorrow would be ready," Frick said.
"He doesn't doubt his power.
Michelson is a member of the Glory Hall, which has done so much for the teams in the past week and so far.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I predicted more matches, but it worked out, so we decided to do that.
He wants to be there in the field, like anyone else."
If Micelson leaves the field on Saturday, he'll break the record of Nick Faldo, who's the biggest match player in the Rieder Cup.
This is where he can complete his career in a Ryder Cup tournament that never matched his individual achievement.
In Michaelson's account, 18 wins, 20 beats and 7 none results, but Furick said that his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
"He's funny, he's likable, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's cool, he's having jokes with others, he's a guy that's great to have on the team," explained Furick.
"I think the younger players had a good time waiting for him, and also this week, and it was very interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
Captain Thomas Björn of the European team knows there's no solution to a big break.
Thomas Björn, a captain of a European team, knows from experience that a profound break in front of the solitary match of the last day of the Ryder Cup is not a guarantee of victory.
Dutchan debuted in 1997 at a match at the Valderram club, where a team led by Sev Ballesteros had a fifth point ahead of the Americans, but had won the match with a slight break with a result of 141⁄2:131 ⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we've had a big break in the match on the Valderrami field; a big take-off in Brooklyn where we've lost; and a Valderrama field where we've won it," said Bjorn after watching the winning games.Class 2018 with the result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at Le Holf National, after which the break-off is 1006.
So history teaches me and every player in the team that nothing is settled.
We'll have to play tomorrow with as much impact as possible.
You go to the field and do whatever you need.
The game will only end after the result has appeared on the panel.
We have the goal of getting this trophies, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I'm focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we're well aware of who we're fighting -- the best players in the world."
Satisfied by the performance of the players in the complicated field, Björn added, "I'll never run ahead.
Tomorrow, things might turn out different.
They're waiting for us tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great playing in the field with a partner when everything's going well, but it's when you're there alone, and you can see what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to set up players to speak tomorrow: at the limit of opportunity.
You leave your partner without support, and now he has to show you what he can do."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number, Jim Furick, expects his partners at a better individual level, except for Jordan Spayt and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
To Furick's very last day, he was on the winning side of Brooklyn, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created "Medium Food."
"I remember every damn word," he said in reply to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the command captain of 1999, organized the players before the last day of the race.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we need to start as successfully as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves one side over another, players in the middle of the distance experience special pressure.
So we put players in the team's composition, as if we were going to, like, do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to try to take the counterattack against Rory Maquillroy, and the first half of the European team came from Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flywood and Ian Poulter.
"The partners themselves, and in this order, I chose because I want to share the effort evenly throughout the game," commented Bjorn for his choice of players in individual matches.
The introduction of a new German warship was postponed again
The state-of-the-art relief frigate of the German Navy was to be operational back in 2014 instead of the obsolete warships of the Cold War, but according to the local media, that would not happen until at least the next year due to poor systems and a steep increase in spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, received from the military spokesman, the entry into operation of the Lineland-Faltz, the main ship has a series of the most modern frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class until the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg ships that were ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the obsolete Bremens.
Clearly, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some reduction technologies such as radar, infrared, and acoustic.
Another major feature is a longer period of maintenance, and new frigates are expected to be able not to return to their port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit warn that the super modern military ships that were to increase Germany’s military capacity in the sea will become obsolete at the time of their deployment.
A multi-hazard frigate F125 came into the headlines of the newspapers last year when the German Navy formally refused to enter the ship and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the arrival of a warship by a ship’s construction company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned the significant software and equipment effects that made the warship impossible for military operations.
The limitations of the software are particularly significant, since the crews of the Baden-Württemberg ship consist of about 120 sailors, only half the number of military personnel serving on the old Frieden-Württemberg frigates of the Bremen class.
It also revealed that the vessel has a significant weight surplus, which makes it less operational and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
It is thought that the Renenland-Paltz frigate is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) in ships of the same class as the Germans were used during World War II.
Besides equipment, another problem is the cumulative cost of the project, which also includes the cost of preparing the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros turned into huge 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion).
The problems of gaining new frigates have become particularly significant in light of recent warnings of the collapse of the German Navy.
At the beginning of the year, Bundestag on Hans-Peter Bartels' Armed Forces reported that the Navy had “a small number of ships that could be used to carry out the fighting”.
The teacher stated that the situation had deteriorated for a time, since the old ships had been out of service and the new ones had not arrived.
He expressed deep regret that none of the Bhaden-Württemberg frigates had been able to complete the Navy.
The National Trust will observe bats ’ secret life
A new study, carried out in land ownership at the Scotland Hill, aims to identify how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Scientists hope that this data will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take steps to preserve them.
In In Inver Gardens, in West Ross, scientists at the National Trust of Scotland will observe species like the netopir of the dwarf and the netopir of the Pygmies, as well as the ears of the normal and the water-night.
Special registrations will be located in strategic locations in the landowner's area to observe the behaviour of bats during the season.
National Trust volunteers and volunteers in Scotland are also conducting mobile tests using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and belonging to bat screams.
Then it's going to develop a detailed map of animal habitation and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser for Scotland’s National Trust, hopes that the results of the research will help determine which areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of measures to care for the environment (for example, the formation of meadows) and to determine how best to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
In the last century, bats have been reduced considerably in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened by the active construction and destruction of territories, which deprives them of nesting sites.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, blotting fly paper, chemical processing of building materials, and house cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, hunting by nighttime helps them to catch prey more efficiently than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echoing techniques to detect insects and interfere with flight pathways.
In Scotland’s National Trust, which cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens, and 76,000 acres [760,000 ha] of land in all countries, bats are being taken seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly investigate, inspect nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, and it's located in Triv in the Damphris-and-Galloway region, where eight out of ten species of bats live in Scotland are found.
The city manager, David Thompson, claims that this is an ideal place for them.
"In the Trev area, excellent conditions for bats," he assures.
"Here are old buildings, many giant trees and other favourable living conditions.
But we need to learn a lot more about bats, and thanks to the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we'll be able to learn more about what's needed for them to thrive."
He insists that it's very important to test the area of bats before any technical work is done, because the unintentional destruction of one nesting site may kill up to 400 females with babies, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats and their nests are protected by law.
Elizabeth Ferrelli, an officer at the Scottish bat Conservation Centre, urged the public to join in the efforts of the organization.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats, and we haven't yet discovered the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of rape, and his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against the German edition
Krishhaniu Ronaldo called the charges of raping "nil" and claimed that people "try to attract attention" using his name.
His lawyers are willing to file a lawsuit against the German news journal Der Spiegel, which published information about suspicions.
American Catherine Myorg accused the forwards of collecting Portugal and the Juventus football club of rape, which happened in 2009 at a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to Der Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her 375,000 dollars for silence.
A few hours after the charges were made, the 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to 142 million of his fans in the Instagram video broadcast, calling the corresponding messages "nil."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander, "The five-time Lord of the Golden Ball.
"They want to get their attention using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to feed on me, but similar situations are part of my work.
I'm happy and I'm fine," added a football player, smiling.
According to Reuters attorney Ronaldo's report, they're preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for published charges, which they call "unacceptable report of privacy suspicion."
Lawyer Christian Schersz stated that a football player would demand compensation for "moral damage in size that corresponds to the seriousness of a violation which is probably one of the most serious cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It's said that the incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at Ronaldu and Major's Night Club, they returned to the player's number, where he allegedly did an act of rape, and the testimony was given to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Major claims that after the incident described, Ronaldo fell to her knees and said that he was a "99% good boy" who had been raised "one percent."
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but with mutual consent.
Major also claims that she turned to the police and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to an after-trial settlement because she was afraid of revenge and warned of "public humiliation".
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel the previous deal, because she continues to suffer from an incident that she says has taken place.
At the time of the incident, Ronald was on the way to the FK Real Madrid of Manchester United, he became an Italian football player this summer, the Juvents team, in 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain's long-term loss of motorists
The U.K. is going to be a long-term regret if you lose the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, and that's a warning to the secretary of the economy, Greg Clarke.
He added that he was satisfied with the announcement by the representatives of Toyota UK who told BBC that in the case of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU without a deal, the company would have to suspend the production and operation of its factory in Bernadette, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Minister Clarke.
A Japanese car manufacturer stated that the effects of border delay in the case of Brexit without a deal could cost jobs.
The station in Bernadette, where the Toyota Models Auris and Avenues are produced last year, has released some 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain were to abandon the EU over the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped," Marvin Cook, director-general of the Toyampas in Bernadette.
Other car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Line, are also concerned about the impact of Britain's withdrawal from the EU without an agreement to trade in international trade.
For example, at BMW, they said that a Mini model factory in Oxford would be shut down a month after Brexit.
The main fear of car manufacturers is that Brexit without a deal can cause risks to supply chains.
The ToyPA production line functions in an operational supply of details and materials according to demand – details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU to order cars.
If the EU leaves the EU without agreement on March 29, the border may be broken by the supply of details, resulting in delays and shortages of materials.
And as the company says, there's no more than one day space on Toy kppp, so the production will have to stop.
Greg Clark pointed out that the EU relationship with Theresa Mei (Chequers Plan) is “shared by schemes to avoid problems at the border”.
"We need a deal, we need to make an optimal agreement that I think will not only make it possible to achieve success at the current moment but also take advantage of the prospects that have emerged," he said during the program today at the BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota and other car manufacturers, we need to preserve the highly efficient supply chains."
Toyopen was not able to tell the company how much production would stop, but in the long run it is expected that an increase in spending would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and thus make it easier to reduce jobs.
Peter Tsvalis, president of the Unite professional company orgy at a 24-year-old factory in Bernadette, said that the other participants were extremely concerned, "I can tell from experience that the reduced jobs are not being restored."
The government representative said, "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, noted at the White House
According to White House representatives on Sunday, Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rodenstein could be “set aside another week” while there are ongoing discussions about the awarding of Bretta Cavanano as judge of the Supreme Court.
She's monitoring the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who's investigating Russia's intervention in elections, the links between Trump and Russia, and the potential interference with justice on the part of the President.
For a few months in Washington, D.C., the possibility of releasing a deputy attorney who would endanger Muller’s independence is discussed.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had expressed the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of an advanced suspension of the president's powers for the 25th amendment.
She did not confirm this information.
But last Monday, he visited the White House in the background saying that the official was going to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was then held at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Tramp stated he wouldn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coincidence with the Senate Legal Committee meeting at which he was supposed to witness to Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation into the charges against Kavano, which further sterilized the Senate vote.
Prime Minister Trumpa, Sarah Sanders, gave a talk on Fox News Sunday.
And she said to her question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not set, maybe it's going to be this week, and I'm expecting her to be postponed another week in view of all the events that have to do with the Supreme Court.
I keep track of the latest information in the press."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not hold a briefing for the media in the White House since September 10.
The chairman, Chris Wallis, asked why.
Saunders replied that not often a brigging event is not linked to "public games" on the side of television reporters, although he said, "I can't deny they're playing at the public."
Then she assumed that the Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
"The resident answers questions more often than any president to him," she said, without referring to the source, "Statistics speaks for itself."
Saunders said the briefing would still be held, but "if there's an opportunity in the press to ask the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We're trying to talk a lot with the press, and it should be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the possibility of talking to the President of the United States is no worse than a press conference."
The Trump regularly answers questions on events outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences for high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York City this week, the president may have shown why this is so, by acting in unsavory ways in front of journalists.
Scottish State Secretary of Health sent a letter to EU employees in response to the fears of Brixit
The State Secretary of Health wrote to citizens of other EU countries working for the Scottish National Health Service to express their appreciation for their work and ask for it to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The government of Scotland has already made a commitment to cover the cost of applications for permanent resettlement for EU citizens working in autonomous government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said, "There has been a period of negotiations over the summer between Britain and the EU on the issue of the way out.
But the British government is stepping up preparations for a possible way out without a deal.
I know this may be a very disturbing time for you.
That's why I'd like to emphasize again how I appreciate the contribution of every worker, regardless of nationality.
Groups from all over the European Union and from countries outside the European Union share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving health services for the benefit of patients and communities we serve.
"Scotland is your home, we really want you to stay."
Christian Ebercrombie underwent surgery after his head injury
A half-way lawyer for Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Ebercrombie, underwent an emergency operation after receiving his head injury in a Sunday match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, which his team lost with a score of 31:27.
The chief trainer of Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player had been injured shortly before the break.
"He came to the sideline where he got evil," said Reed.
By side line, coaches and medical personnel had given Ebercromby oxygen before taking it for further examination.
The team official, Tennessee State Tigers, informed Chris Harris from the WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee), that Ebercrombie was operating at the University of Vandby Medical Center.
Harris added that "until there's no evidence of the type and severity of the trauma," the Dennis State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player was injured.
Abercrombie, a classmate, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after the transition from the Illinois team.
He's done five hits on Sunday before he got out of the game, so he's got 18 interceptes during the season.

This event is out of harmony with all Corbin's attempts to attract young voters.
Higher government customs will be drawn from those who do not pay taxes in the U.K.
In the Ministry of Finance, an additional £120 million a year is expected to help the homeless.
As Theresa May declared today, British real estate is going to be more expensive for foreigners, and the extra funds are going to be spent helping the homeless.
This step can be viewed as an attempt to neutralize the efforts of Jeremy Corbin to involve young voters in promises of more affordable housing directed at high - paying workers.
The increase in the customs will involve individuals and legal persons who don't pay taxes in Britain, and the additional funds from the government are going to help those who have to sleep in the open sky.
An additional two - year increase in housing and real estate for rent may amount to three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, an additional £120 million a year is expected.
Experts estimate that 13% of the new real estate that's being built in London is owned by foreign citizens, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who only dream about their own home.
Many wealthy parts of the country, including the capital, are abandoned, as a large number of foreign buyers live most of the time outside the country.
A new plan of action appeared just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state tax to make housing more affordable for young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying land without using it any longer, and he urged Theresa May to give up quotas for the available real estate to fix the unprofit situation in the housing market in Britain.
Corbin announced a number of important real estate reforms, such as rent control and non-refoulement.
It also suggests expanding local council in the area of the construction of a new home.
Theresa Mei said last year, "I promised I'd dedicate my prize to restoring the British dream -- for every new generation of life, it's better.
This requires change in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, buy housing under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become unattainable, and the problem of living in the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "Too, I'd like to be the main coach in collecting Scotland."
Jack Ross's chief FK coach, Suderland, says he's "a longing" to take over Scotland's collection.
A 42-year-old Scotsman has set about re-establishing a club from the north-east of the country, which is now the third place in the First Football League, three-point retreating from the leader.
Ross moved to Stedium of Light this summer, returning the last season of St. Merryn's F.C., to the Prime League of Scotland.
"I wanted to introduce my country as a gambler.
I went to Scotland’s second collection, but it all ended,” said Ross during the Sports program at BBC Scottland’s radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched about the game of the Gampden Park in Scotland City."
The only hope for me is to be successful in the position of the top coach of the club."
The predecessors of Ross at Sanderland were Dick Lawyer, David Mys, Sam Ellardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy King, Gustavo Piet and Paolo Di Canio.
FK's former chief coach, Alola Atletic, states that he did not feel nervous about going to a big club following such authoritative names, before rejecting the Banceley and Ipswich Taun FK proposals.
"At this point, I'll think I'm successful if the club returns to the Prime League.
Because of its structure and its material and technological support, this club is no doubt in line with the level of the Premier League," he said.
"It's going to be a difficult task, but I don't think I'm going to be successful."
Ross has only been building a three-year training career, and he's been working as another trainer at the Dambarton, and he's spent 15 months at the FK coach's Harts.
Then he helped Alloa speak after the FK got to the third division, and in the next season from St. Merren, it went from the flight stage to the acquisition of the title of the winners of the first DI.
According to Ross, now he feels more comfortable than ever during his game career at CLK, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Moreren, and Hamilton Academic.
"I'm at the intersection," he recalls, talking about going to "Alloa."
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more suitable for me than a game.
That sounds strange, because I was successful, I made good money at this, and I reached a certain height.
But it's not easy to play.
There are many challenges that we face each week.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as a master trainer, I feel where I am.
I've always been interested in training, and I've never felt so comfortable in my entire adult life since I chose this profession."

Research: 5:30 Sunday: A perfect time for a beer kitchen
The summer heat helped increase the supply to British pubs that were not going through the best of times but increased pressure on the restaurant network.
According to the calculations, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant profits decreased by 4.8 percent.
The writer, Peter Martin, of CGA, who is involved in business development consulting, said, "Thanks to solar weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup, July was behind the same pattern as the previous month, when the pubs were raised by 2.8 percent, and the business went worse in the restaurants.
The turndown was 1.8% in July.
Drinking pubs and bars, for the time being, have the best performance - increasing their profits is equal to the loss of restaurants.
The pubs that are served also suffered from heat, but not as much as the restaurants.
Seems like the only thing that interests visitors is drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, the sale of drinks per month increased by 6.6%, and the sale of food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at the Free and Gosse Business Department in RSM, said, "We've seen a good trend since the end of April.
Weather and large - scale social or sports events remain the main factors affecting the domestic market.
It's no wonder that groups of restaurants continue to lose their income, that the annual decline of sales of 4.8 percent is particularly concerned about the necessity of reducing costs.
The long hot summer doesn't come at the right time for the food supply, so let's see if we can keep the temperature that we saw in August to give them such a necessary rest."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new institutions, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowing output of brands.
The Coffer Pech Tracker Gaul indicator of sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants of Britain is a representation of the compiled and analyzed productivity of 47 working groups with a combined product of more than 9 billion pounds, and this is a generally accepted industry standard.
1 out of 5 children has a social network account hidden from their parents
Research showed that 1 child in 5 -- sometimes under 11 years of age -- has a secret from parents and teachers on social networking accounts
Research into 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram
This increased concern about the possible sexual orientation of the body
20 percent of students reported having a "core account" showing their parents
One in five children, sometimes not older than 11 years of age, is creating an account in social networks that keeps you from going to adults.
Research into 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram, a social network for photo exchange.
The news has raised concerns about the possible sexual orientation.
20 percent of students reported having a clean "core" account that showed parents as well as one or more private ones.
The mother, who accidentally came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw there a call to rape me.
A study conducted by Digital Audit UK and Hedmasters' and Healthes' Conferences in private schools showed that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two identities in social networks.
The head of the HMC association, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's very disturbing that many teenagers feel they want to create an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Ailed Doyle will be a "a representative of athletes" for the Scottish Athletics Council
Alyd Doyle has been elected to the Council of Scottian Athletics as an independent director at the annual general board meeting of board members.
Doyle is the mother-in-law of Scotland, and the chairman of the council called this step the great opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Ailed enjoys great respect among athletes in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are convinced that by using it to the council, athletic sports in Scotland will benefit greatly," Beatty assured us.
Doyle says, "I was inspired to represent athletes, and I hope I can really benefit from this and promote sports in Scotland."
An American, a four-time Olympic champion who won 200 to 400 meters in 1996 at the Atlantic Games, and now a BBC sports inspector, has lost the ability to go through a transit chemic attack.
And he wrote in Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much I could do.
With incredible effort, I recovered completely, learning to walk again, and I am now performing dynamic exercises!
Thank you for your words of support!"
In the ad, women's breasts compared to cows - the mind of Internet users split up.
The milk-milk manufacturer encountered a mixed reaction from Internet users to advertising that compares young mothers with real cows.
To mark the release of a product called "the world's first silent milk sucker", Elvie's technology consumer company released an ad in the form of a humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom that gives mothers a new sucker.
Four real mothers dance in a blue-filled cowyard under a song that contains the words, "Yes, I'm feeding myself, but I don't have tail" and "As you can see, it's not a wreath, it's my breasts."
And then the chorus goes, "Suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, milk, no waste."
However, ads published on the company's Facebook page caused a violent discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the response of Internet users has been mixed, and many have noted that the ad does not value "a horrible organization" in the manufacturing industry.
"It's not a very wise decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but their children are taken away from them a few days after they are born,” wrote one of the users.
Elvie milk detector can easily be hidden in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment, which says, "It's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you use them to advertise a breast-feeder for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone else said, "This ad is too far from reality."
The other people were protecting the commercial video, and one of the women's videos turned out to be "very funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would certainly have bought such a thing if I still had breast - feeding.
As I sucked my milk, I felt really like a cow.
Advertisements are a little crazy, but I didn't look for hidden meaning in it.
"That's a great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "Smart ads, focused on moms that suck milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This ad is not aimed at highlighting the benefits and disadvantages of the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women are showing breasts hidden in their braiders.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel cows.
But Elvie's sucker works absolutely quietly, doesn't have wires or tubes, and it's easy to hide in a feeding bra, which allows women to move freely, keep kids, and even go outside.
Ana Balarin, the partner and executive director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on this situation: "Elvie's sucker is so revolutionary that he demanded a vivid and provocative representation.
After spending a parallel between women healing milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breast - feeding, in an exciting and interesting way, showing an incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker would bring.
Elvie is not a first-time feeder in news headlines.
In the framework of the London week fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product as she drew the clothes from the modeler Martha Yakubska.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively constant, partly because hard rhetoric and politics on the part of Trump’s administration made the placement of children in caregivers more difficult.
Traditionally, in most cases, the caregivers themselves were immigrants without documents, and now they are afraid to threaten their own ability to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
Risk went up in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to give prints to their fingers and that these data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a top executive of the Immigration and Customs Bureau, testified to Congress that dozens of people were arrested by the Bureau's staff who applied for care for minors without escort.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 percent of the people who are caregivers or members of their households are in the country illegally, and many of them are foreigners who commit an offence.
So we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to the shelter workers, in order to deal more quickly with the cases of children, officials have introduced new regulations that require some children to appear in court within a month of detention, not 60 days later, as before.
Many of them will be able to use the video link rather than appear in court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who are not eligible for asylum in court decisions will be deported quickly.
According to asylum workers and official figures from responsible employees in recent months, the longer the children stay in custody, the greater the risk that they will experience anxiety or depression, the greater the risk of violence or flight.
Law - enforcement officials argue that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving the children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to our friends, we run the risk of increasing the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria told the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw the troops immediately.
Furthermore, before the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Secretary, Walid Al-Mulam, urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though war had been going on in the country for eight years.
Mualem, who is also a deputy to the Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally present on Syrian land in the fight against terrorism, so that “the attitude towards them will be appropriate”.
"They must go immediately and set no conditions," he declared at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that “the war on terrorism is virtually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He stated that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we cleared all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
They're basically teaching and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Al-Assad.
In the war - torn country of France, more than 1,000 soldiers were sent.
As for the refugees, Mualem assured them that they had the right conditions for their return, and he also accused some Western countries of spreading baseless fears that would prevent refugees from returning.
"We have called upon international community and humanitarian organizations to help people return," he said.
"We observe trying to politicalize a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not assist Syria in rebuilding the country until a political agreement is made between Asad and the resistance to stop the war.
The UN diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last great protection of the rebels, has created an opportunity for further political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented the large-scale offensive of Syrian forces supported by Russia from reaching a province of three million people.
However, Mualem emphasized that the agreement had "other terms" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including the Al-Qaeda-related Front al-Nusra fighters, who would "will be destroyed."
Emissary of UN Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of the new committee, which will include government representatives and opposition, to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and to create conditions for the holding of elections.
Mualem offered conditions for the Syrian government to participate on the committee, stating that his work should be limited to a "review of articles of a valid constitution" and warned against interference.
Why the Trumpa Will Be Reelected
According to this logic, Trump may be reborn in 2020, if, perhaps, many liberal viewers are expected, he does not form the authority ahead of time after a scandal and impeachment.
No doubt, it would be the most dramatic conclusion of the presidency all the time!
Currently, spectators do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of spectators on the CNN channel has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) and actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News has an average of 2.4 million people in prime-time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddown Show is at the top of the MSNBC cable channel at the top of the rating of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news is being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's out of our minds," said Neil Beer, executive producer of the drama "The Last candidate" on ABC channel about the Secretary of State, who becomes president after the destructive attack on Capitolia.
Nell Scowell, an experienced homologist writer and author of "The Better Fun Mouths: A few hard truths about entering the Hollywood Men Club," offers another theory.
She remembered a trip to Boston taxi before elections in 2016.
The driver told her they'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he said, "that's the story Mrs. Squill told me.
Chaos is fun.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington's stories are able to determine the future of Roy's case against Wade, the possibility of reuniting immigrant families, and the world economy.
Disfellowshipping is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it's not to be said that you're just trying to remain informed citizens, when you're watching a group of experts talk about Bob Woodworth's use of "good informed" sources for his book Strikes, Paul Manfort's jacket for the skin of the ostrich for $15,000, as described in The Washington Post, and the consequences of Mr. Trump's shocking anatomics published by Stormie Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
"The sense of reality show is partly related to the fact that you are fed into something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive executive director of Weelhouse Entertainment, and the author of the television program "The Stars of the Sloe," about the rotations in the actressy warehouse and the daily stories on the Trump show.
If you allow yourself to miss a single episode, you can drift away hopelessly.
When I was able to meet Mr. Fleas at his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai, there was a warm, sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
It was not possible for him to break free from the TV — not when Brett Kavano was put before the Senate Legal Committee, but the future of the Supreme Court hung in his hair.
"I remember when we created all those crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of western civilization," Mr. Flakes told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they seemed right."

External Inflation of Funds in the Most Strong Intermediate Elections to Congress
It's no wonder that in the 17th county of Pennsylvania, extra money is being directed, because, because of the review of the boundaries of the elective districts, the two conventioners are seeking for one chair.
A democracy, a member of the House of Conor Lembour, who won the victory in another district on an additional election last spring, is fighting for this recently changed suburb of Pittsburgh.
Lemb is against another valid congressman, Republican Kit Rothfs, who now represents the old 12th county of Pennsylvania, whose borders are largely similar to the new 17th.
The maps were reprocessed after, in January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had ruled that the old boundaries of the regions had been laid out in favour of the Republicans, contrary to the Constitution.
The pre-election race in the new 17th county has led to a fierce confrontation between the financial units of the major parties, the US Democratic Party Committee for Congress Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
The nickname Lemba has become very famous in Pennsylvania, after winning with a minimum advantage in 18th County, in an additional election to Congress in March, which was used by the public at large.
This place was owned by the Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won this 20-point district.
Political experts have given little priority to democracies.
In the United States, there was a possibility that El Salvador could be punished for supporting China, but they changed.
Diplomats reminded Washington of the weak resistance to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported the position of Beijing.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, who also had a hotel in Panama before the partners removed the staff hired by Trump Organization.
The officials of the Department of State decided to withdraw the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the “recent decisions on the ignorance of Taiwan”, declared the Secretary-General of Department Gezer Noyerte at the beginning of this month.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in 2017, particularly in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The fines offered, which anticipated cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for that country of Central America with its high levels of unemployment and murder.
Internally, officials from North and Central America postponed the conference on a high level of security and economic prosperity.
But by the middle of September, high-ranking government officials came to realize that they wanted the conference to take place, and in fact, the issue of sanctions against El Salvador had ended.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pens is now planning to take the floor at a conference that is scheduled to take place in mid-October, as a sign that the administration considers this to be a very important event.
At that, three U.S. messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there were no new cruel reports or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s representative at the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that three U.S. officials, two of whom are diplomats, had to make an anonymous presentation.
The information they gave confirmed a foreign analyst close to the administration who also spoke about the conditions of anonymity.
Learn History
The next problem is the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Muller about possible interference with the justice of Trump, a strong proof of why we can find it in public information now available.
As part of its investigation, it is reported that Muller is testing the possible connection between the Trump Company and the attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence of Congress comes in other hands, Trumpa will have to report to the conventioners, as well as to the voters and eventually to the same party.
There's a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't mean to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as are his colleagues in Europe.
We're all on both sides of the Atlantic to make a choice that will determine the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup d’état against Hitler if only the West would oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the slaughter.
The course of history is determined by such shifting moments, and the uncontrolled movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
There's a couple of these fractures waiting for the Americans right now.
What will we do if Trump release the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the person on whom Mr. Muller's fate depends?
Rosenstein got into trouble when this newspaper had information that last year he suggested writing secretly to the president and sharing thoughts on Trump's incomparability.
She called the information in The Times inaccurate.
"What will we do if the investigation into the Britta Kavano case, which recently started by the FBI, is not sufficiently thorough or honest, or if Kavano's candidature for office in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite strong accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we, in the medium term, vote for those members of Congress who can hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, then there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech - speaking Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With such an inheritance, can I not look forward to the future with optimism?"
Norman Eisen, Senior Fellow of Science at the Brookings Institute, Head of Citys for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, author of The Last Century in Europe: A History of Five People and One House.
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is looking forward with optimism to meeting the Vienna Red.
The FC of Rangers takes Thursday, and after an amazing night's work in Spain in the Villarreal game at the beginning of this month's victory over the Austrians, it gives the Scottish Club a good chance of getting out of the G League of Europe.
And because of the trauma of the knee, the half-protector Graham Dorrans was able to play for the first time in the season only in his team with the Villarreal, which ended with the score at 2:2, but he thinks that the F.C. Rangers can use this as a springline to achieve more.
"For us it was a good result, because Villarreal is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We're out on a game hoping to get something and we've got one point.
Maybe at the end of the match we could go forward, but in general, the night is probably just the outcome.
In the first time, the opponent was better, but after a break we fixed the situation for our benefit.
On Thursday, another major opposition will take place in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not easy, our future rivals have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on the support of the fans, and I'm sure we can give us a fight and get a positive result.
Last year, of course, has been difficult, starting from my traumas to making changes at the club itself, but now things are normal.
We have a great warehouse, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can move on, leave behind the past season, and succeed."
Women Lose Sleep for the Fear of Pension Savings
Even though the poll participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize self-care, few of us talked about it with our family.
About half of the people who were involved in the survey of Nationalwood said they were talking to their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% of those surveyed talked about it with their children.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't rush to have a conversation on this," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationalwood.
That's where you're going to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need unless you inform your parents of your wishes in advance.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to receive care, because this can be an important factor in determining cost.
Include a financial consultant: He may recommend a way to cover the right expenses.
Funds to finance long-term care include traditional insurance policies, hybrids, accumulated life insurance, or self - support at your own expense (if you have money).
Prepare legal documents carefully, enabling you to avoid legal hardship in advance.
Prepare confidence for your representative to control your medical care and to ensure that your wishes are fulfilled if you are unable to do so personally.
In addition, we recommend that account be established for the payment of money.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and will pay the bills in case of a disability.

In Ilfracum, a man shot a few times from a pneumatic rifle
The man fired a pneumatic rifle several times when he returned home from the party.
A 40-year-old victim was in Oxford Grove in Ilfracum, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The officers described an arrow that took place at 02:30 in British summer as "inheritability."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds do not constitute a threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, they reported the state authorities, but the number of victims could increase.
Out of the communications system, there is no information available from the Dongala renaissance, the area north of Palau, which is closer to the 7.5 magnitude of the earthquake.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palau.
Consider a few basic facts about the city of Palau on the island of Sulawes and the Dongala Regent.
Palm, the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawis, with a population of some 379,800 according to the year 2017.
When the earthquake struck the tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a revegetation that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast line on the northwest island of Sulawes.
According to data for 2017, the administrative region in the lower province is home to some 299,200 people.
Fishing and agriculture are major economic areas in the province of Central Sulawis, especially in the Dongal coastal region.
Insect mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to an Indonesian agency to mitigate the effects of natural disasters in the last 100 years, Palau and Dongala have suffered from tsunamis several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed as a result of the Dongala tsunami.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismically active Pacific fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
The following are some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, over half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March, early April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnetic earthquake of 6.8 points swept south of Java, Indonesia’s largest island, and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra, an earthquake of 7.6 points was recorded.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 - point earthquake swept down one of the Mantawi islands near Sumatra and caused a tsunami of up to 30 feet [10 m] high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Podijjai renaission in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic that people have not yet been able to forget the devastating earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the wreckage of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Lombok tourist island of Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Many homes were destroyed by the earthquake, and thousands of tourists were unable to leave the island immediately.

Treka Paylin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska, and the candidate for the position of Vice-President Sarah Payin, were arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by the police in Alaska, a 29-year-old Pailina from Vasily, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with preventing reports of violence and resistance during arrest.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took her phone away.
According to KTU, Payin is under charge in the Matanaska-Sustina investigating isolation, with a 500 dollar mortgage right.
He was brought before a court of justice on Saturday, when he was asked if he was guilty, they're reporting online.
In three cases of class A misconduct, Pailina is charged with arrest for up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with misconduct in class B, which is punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time that Pailina has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pillin.
His mother, Sarah Payin, telephoned the police and reported the possibility of an attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans ’ Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, and also with preventing reports of domestic violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol abuse when that incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her on the face.
In 2016, Sarah Peylin criticized groups of veterans for justifying her son’s violent behavior as a post - traumatic stress disorder after his service in Iraq.
In Indonesia the tsunami caused hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died following the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawes on Friday.
The 7.5 - point earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Network communications and power supply are out of order, and the number of victims can rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck close to the center of the island of Sulawesi, northwest of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The video on social networking shows the moment the weather hit.
Hundreds gathered at a beach festival in Palau when tsunami struck the beach.
Federal accusers require rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York
In New York City, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saiful Saipa, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City, which resulted in eight deaths, a rare punishment that had not been used in the state for federal crime since 1953.
It's said that in October, 30-year-old Saipa was driving a home Depot pickup who took a bicycle track along the highway of the West Side, the Lower Manhattan, and started beating down the cyclists and pedestrians who had come in his way.
According to a report about the intention to secure the execution of eight persons in the Southern District of New York to justify the death penalty, the accusers must prove that Saipov “intently” killed eight persons and “intently” seriously injured the body.
According to the court records, each of these counts involve the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Assault charged Saipo with 22 counts, including eight charges of murder for the purpose of extortion, which is usually brought by federal prosecutors in cases involving organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of vehicles.
According to the accusers, who described the crime of Said as "wrong, cruel and vicious," this attack is the result of "reasonable planning and pre-thought mind."
Victims to whom Saifula Habibulvevich Saipah was injured, injured or killed, became Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lore Dekadt, Darren Dreyk, Aryl Erlich, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnco, as described in the plan report.
Five of those killed were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time in New York City, there's been a criminal case that's been punished with death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the federal death penalty was carried out in New York City in 1953, a couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy in favor of the Soviets during the cold war two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saip’s court records, the native of Uzbekistan did not display any qualms of conscience in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he was not sorry for what he had done.
According to Saipov’s indictment, the authorities informed him that he had been inspired by an ISIS video attack that he was watching on his phone.
The police report that he had also asked to hang the IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He did not declare himself guilty of being charged with 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipa, said that they were “very disappointed” by the Office's decisions.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting the guilt and sentencing the life sentence without the possibility of release will only reinforce the psychological trauma of the victims of the events," Patton said.
Saipua’s party had also asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
Parliament’s member of the Conservative Party believes that NAJEL FRAJA should be appointed to the responsibilities of the Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Conservative Party meeting, Nigel Faraj has promised "mobilizing the People's Army."
The former leader of the Party of Independence of the United Kingdom declared that politicians should “receive pressure” from the Euro-Rosekeptics, since one of the Parliament's members, Theresy May, offered his candidature for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boun, a member of the Conservative Party, claimed on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have done better if Mr. Faraj had been Secretary of Brexit.
Respect for the problems Mae faced in trying to reconcile his deep-seated ranks has led even more to the fact that the members of the Conservative Party who are protesting against leaving joined the special protest in the city against Brexit.
The winner is trying hard to put the Chequers compromise plan into action, despite attacks by Brexit supporters, against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that she won't give up trying to make arrangements with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force the euroceptists and Labourists to choose between what she offers and "haos."
Mr. Boun stated at the Leves Menas Leave meeting in Solichal that he wanted "to give up Chequers."
He suggested that Mr. Faraj should come out of the shadows and assume responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were responsible for it, we would've left," he said.
Welllingborough's Parliament member added, "I'm going to support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We have fought in world wars not to get organized.
We want to pass our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Boon retracted the assumption that, after the 2016 vote, public opinion changed, "The idea that the British had changed their mind and didn't want to go out was completely out of reality."
Member of the Conservative Party and supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, "Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers' plan is unpopular among the general public, opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not supported by our party and our activists, who are actually walking around the streets fighting for voters' votes.
Please remove Chequers and start listening."
In her address to Teresa May, she said, "The Prime Minister keeps his office when she fulfills her promises."
Mr. Faraj stated that politicians should feel pressure if they're going to give up the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a question of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say they won't get out of their hands."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, which is planning to betray the Brexit idea, to feel pressure.
We mobilize the national army of this country that will lead us to our victory in Brexit and will never be relieved until we become independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the opposers passed Birmingham and then held a two - hour rally in the city center.
A number of activists were waving the Brexit Conservatives after they launched the group these weekends.
Leiborist Lord Adonis ridiculed conservatives for having created security problems since the conference because of their party program.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and the technologies needed for the Canada-plus, well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a full farce.
"There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "think seriously" about running for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that, after the November elections, she was "to think seriously about speaking for the presidency."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the general congregations in West Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts told about his future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, runs in November for a second term against a member of the Republican Party of Jeff Dile, who was the co-leader of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is viewed as a basic candidate that may be able to fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, the 36th meeting was held with the voters in common meeting format since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to participate in the election as president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and for that, there's got to be a woman on his head."
They arrested a suspect of killing from the guns of the LUS Tigers basketball bomber.
At the Baton-Rose police, Louisiana, Saturday, it was reported that on the night of the night, a suspect was arrested on a shooting weapon by a LUS Tigers basketball bomber, Wade Sims.
The Baton-Rose Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in East time.
On Friday, they published a video recording of shots asking for help to recognize a man on him.
A 20-year-old, Sims was shot dead at the University of Suthern on Friday morning.
"Vade Sims was shot in the head, and he was killed," declared 247/ports Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade took his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found at the scene of the crime, armed with weapons, and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton police office.
Sims, with a height of 6 feet and 6 inches and a PhD, grew up in Baton-Rose, and he played 32 games with 10 stars in the last season, and he spent 17.4 minutes on the playing field, using 5.6 points and 2.9 selects.
Grand Pri of Russia: Lewis Hemilton reduced the delay in the world championship struggle after the team had decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettiter.
From the moment that on Saturday, Walter Botts left Lewis Hemelton behind, it became clear that Mercedes ’ command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas was a good starter of pod-off and almost passed away by Hemelton, who was trying to maintain his position on the first two turns and allowing Fettle to attack his teammate.
Fettiter went on a pit stop first and left the Hemilton on a highway in the tail of a race that had to solve everything.
The driver of the Mercedes team drove another circle and left behind the Futter, but Heilton bursted into the leaders after some wheel manoeuvre, leaving the driver of the Ferrari reluctantly out of his inner space because of the risk that he would be squeezed out after a two - way manoeuvre had led him forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferreppen started off the back row of the net and remained in seventh place until the end of the first circle.
He took over most of the race because he didn't change the tires so he could quickly come to the finish and take Kimy Rykonne from the fourth place.
In the end, it's on the pit stop on the 44th circle, but it's not able to increase the pace by the last eight, and that's why Raikonen sat in the fourth place.
"It's a heavy day because the Knave was put on top of all weekend and showed grace when he let me pass.
The team did an exceptional job to sit first and second,” Hemelton said.
Body Language Does Not Affect You
On Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Fainsin for her firm stand that she did not disclose the contents of Christine Blaise Ford's letter, accusing the candidate before the Supreme Court of Britta Cavanano of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, but instead expressed his opinion of what happened in the Senate, which he said was a human "substantial, disgusting and lying."
"The only thing that could have happened, and all the wonderful thing that's happening in the last few days of the Senate is anger; you'll see evil men who demonstrate vileness, lewdness and lying," he said.
"You look at the publications and the lucid information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinsinstein, did you share the information?
Remember her answer... Did you make the document known? — “What?
Oh, no.
I did not declare it."
Wait a minute.
"No, we didn't declare it," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Fainsinstein received a letter of detailed indictments filed by Ford against Cavano, and in early September its contents were released, but Fainsinte denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't disclose the information that I got from her," said Fainste to the Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promise."
But her objection seems to have been displeased by the president, who commented at the Saturday meeting, and said, "I'll tell you, the language of her body wasn't impressive at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone hold tight."
In continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the President assumed that the accusations of their own ends were being used by democracies.
"They're determined to regain power in any necessary way.
You see meanness, despicableness, they don't care who insults who they have to go through to get power and control," Mediaite quotes the president's words.
"Dandy Stars" - "BelFlast Jayants" - 5:3
The player, Patrick Duyer, threw two sheiks in a match against Dundee.
"Dandy Stars" was rehabilitated for a five-year defeat in an elite league from "Belfast Jayants", winning a Saturday match game with Account 5:3.
Jaitants got an early advantage in two sheikhs thanks to Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coone had a couple of bills down in the home match, and then Duyer went on again, "Jantes."
François Bouchard's "Dandi" player compared the score, and Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's two heads ensured their victory.
This is the third in the elite league season of the defeat of Adam Kifa, who won the free victory over the Dandi with the score of 2:1 Friday evening in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season, the three previous games were won by the Jayants team.
At the time of the transfer of Kendall McFall, Duier threw his first chess at the fourth minute ( 3:35 p.m.) and then, four minutes later, Bovelle, who got the Shabe from David Rutherford, doubled the bill.
After a stressful first period on the fourteenth minute (13:10), Salvain returned his owners to the game and on the sixteenth minute (15:16) Cooney, after receiving the Shabe from Matt Markwardt, compared the score.
Duyer preferred Jainths before the first break, throwing down his second best car at the end of the first period.
The owners of the fields regrouped, and Bouchar by twenty - eight minutes (27:37) recomparisoned the score, throwing down the jack when his team overstated it.
Thanks to the efforts of Coone and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he led the band forward for the first time and won his team in the fifth half of the period.
On Friday, the Jaitts team, who's already lost four of the last five games, will play a race match against Milton Queens.
Air traffic accident killed hundreds of people on a plane to avoid an earthquake
An air traffic attendant in Indonesia was declared a hero after he valued his own life to help fly a plane with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives after the heavy tsunami that caused the tsunami, on the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Heavy underground shocks continue to shake the area, and many people are trapped in the city of Palu.
But unlike those colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the train station, which was greatly shaken, at the Mutiar-SIS airport in Palau.
He remained on the ground to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the landing tower, had safely risen.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought it was going off.
In time, he died in a hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian Aeronautical Service Provider Johanes Sirait stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Bilkpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palau.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of casualties can reach thousands, as the disaster mitigation agency of the country states that access to Dongala, Sihi and Buttong is limited.
"The number of victims can increase, as many bodies are still under debris and many of them cannot be reached," said the official of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves six feet [6 m] high devastated the city of Palau, where mass burials will take place on Sundays.
Air force and passenger aircraft provide relief and food.
Reese Kusum, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News, "Every minute quick aid brings the bodies.
Clean water is not enough.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere."
The Chairman of the International Red Cross Committee in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, said to CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get worse."
President Joco Ododo of Indonesia came to Palau on Sunday and said to the military officers of the country, "I ask you all to work day and night to do all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on Lombok Island, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia: As stated in Air Niugini, after the plane crashed into the Lagoon, one man disappeared.
Avia company that had carried out a disaster in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man had disappeared, although it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crews had been safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
At Air Niugini, a passenger was unable to find his condition on Saturday day.
The company reports that its representatives are trying to find a husband and are working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to that end.
The airlines did not immediately respond to a request for more information about passengers, such as their age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and the crew after the plane fell on the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, the officials reported that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
At the airlines and the Navy, the U.S.A. said that the plane landed in the Lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has flown over the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Janes, said that the plane was flying very low over the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told us that he and others managed to get through the emergency exits on a ton plane by belt.
He explained that the flight attendants were panicking and shouting and that he had received a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the dock upgrade also helped the rescue operation by transporting people to the shore by means of an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safe Network, in the last two decades, 111 people have died in air accidents involving air traffic registered in PNG, but it does not include Air Niugini.
An analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution involved a case against a man who was accused of burning a woman from Missouri alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used the cell phone records to replicate the movement of the 29-year-old Quinn Telis accused and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers victim on the night of the murder.
Rowlett, reports The Clarion Ledger, tells us that he got data on the location from several mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his previous statement.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sandford, the police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in the city.
When the accusers asked if Tellis was true when he said that night was in a Sandford pickup, Sandford said that he was "brighter because my pickup was in Nesville."
Another discrepancy was that Telis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Telephone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after the death of Chambers Telis, he removed text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Gail said.
The defense must raise its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be passed to the jury later that day.
The High Brad, what is the willful hip hop?
Three hip-hop-hopeers want to challenge a negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The Group The High Brad of Bristol states that hip hop has changed its nature – away political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the vents and make the hip pop popular again.
Artists like The Futures and Common have recently witnessed this resurgence in the United Kingdom through groups like Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark skin?
In New York City, the baby-sitter filed a couple suit for release, receiving a "racist" message
In New York, the baby-sitter filed a lawsuit for a couple who were free of discrimination after receiving the wrong message from the mother complaining that she was a "other dark skin."
The couple deny that they're growing up, comparing the lawsuit with extortion.
Lancey Placco-Flacesman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Gisel Morris, who came to her first day in 2016, was dark.
"No, ONE TIMNOCHIRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flacman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she twice sent him over to Miss Morris.
As reported in New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flacman felt "uncomfortable" and released Ms. Morris, saying that their previous nanny, who was an African American, did her job badly and that she looked forward to a baby-sitter from the Philippines instead.
Miss Morris was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing for a couple, hoping to get the release compensation on the amount of salary she would have received in six months of work with a couple to whom she was first hired, although without a contract, to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them that you don't have to do that," she said the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the charge that they were racist, the couple said that the liberation of Morris was a wise decision, since they feared that they could not trust her after being offended.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent.
She's not a racist.
We're not growing up," the Post told her husband, Joel Plaza.
"But would you leave your children to a man whom you treated rudely, even if it wasn't deliberately?
Your baby?
HAPPY."
Compared to the suit, Plasco said that his wife had given birth only two months ago and had not yet fumbled.
"Would you have avenged someone after that?
This is a bad thing," added the investment banker.
Although the legal proceedings are still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media networks, critical of their conduct and logic.
According to the new letter, the publishers of Padington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a silent bear
Bonda Karen Yankel's daughter, born almost immediately after the book agreed to print, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who's been reading the book for the first time before it was published.
Now that's funny, because we know of the huge success that's been achieved in the Padington story."
Telling that her father, who was a BBC operator, before a small toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, was optimistic about the fact that his work had been rejected, and she shared it as the 60th anniversary of the book's release at the same time felt "joy and sorrow," because the father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was very proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was a pretty humble person and didn't like to brag," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as a child of his own!" Because when children achieve something, we take pride in them, even though it's not theirs, not our own.
I think that's how he viewed Padington's success.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say good-bye with my phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to two hospitals called Louis Pasteur in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
"We regularly phoned, said everything was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Edn-Laperus.
"And then Cat called me over and said she would die for the next two minutes and I should say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The drugs that doctors gave her so that her heart would continue to fight have gradually ceased to function and had to come out of her body.
She died some time before everything was shut down.
I had to just sit and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn't help trying, screaming, or crying because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should've really been holding myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperus, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, ignoring the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down and could not hold back my tears.
This is hard to explain, but it was during my flight that Nadu began to feel deep sympathy.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two grieving women leave cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide work hard to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries are left on the Valleian Bridge with telephone numbers that people can ask for support, as well as messages that can be inspired by prayers.
Ms. Davis Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as I do every day," she said.
A 45-year-old, Miss Davis, who lives in Lidney, said that her son was a prospective cook with a pretty smile.
"Everybody knew him for a smile.
They always said that smile made any room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother’s body after he had committed suicide.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid this will have consequences."
Miss Davis created cards "that people know that there are people they can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't lock yourself in, you have to talk."
Ms. Humphries, who had been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, who had lived with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed, that he had depression or anything like it," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on the day of Christmas, he's finally despondent, and when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't look in their eyes or anything."
She said that his death had become a huge trauma to them, but they had to survive it, "It has been devastating.
I'm sorry, it's on the family.
But we have to keep living and fight."

The future Britta Kavano hangs on his hair: The FBI is starting to investigate.
"I thought that if we could get what we asked – a time-limited and time-bound investigation – we might have reached some agreement – that said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the committee was going to "frozen" in the face of an unprecedented loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his followers want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has to do with time.
The intermediate election will take only five weeks, on November 6th, if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will make it very difficult for them to make their own individual election to the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush's leadership, and by means of which he met his wife, Ashley, who worked as his personal secretary, Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
The Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 democracies are sitting, will pass the vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his nomination for the position of Judge of the Supreme Court.
During Kim's reign, the number of North Korean defectors has "cut down"
After Kim Jong-in came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors dropped to South Korea, claiming a South Korean legislator.
Park Pion Seug, referring to the data of the Republic of South Korea Unit Ministry, said that last year, there were 1,127, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, and that smugglers carrying illegals now required more money.
Public comments were held back in Phinim.
The vast majority of North Korean exiles eventually offer South Korea citizenship.
In Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally at war, has improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, leaders of two countries met in Pchenne and discussed the denuclearization issues that had been discussed.
This was following the June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-in in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Secretary, Ry Jon-Ho, in the background of the approved sanctions, accused the United States of not having made progress since that time.
"With no trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there cannot be a word of unilateral disarmament," Ry Yon-ho stated in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy calls Britta Cavanano "religious" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
A minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosy named a candidate for the position of a Supreme Court judge Bretta Kavano as "historic" and stated that he was not working in the Supreme Court at the temperature.
Pelosi commented on Saturday's Texas Tribune Festival in Ostin, Texas.
"I've been thinking all the time that if a woman had ever spoken like this, she would have been called "sterical," and Pelosie commented on her reaction to Cavanano's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavanano emotionally denied the charge of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when both of them were teenagers.
In his opening words, Kavano was very emotional, sometimes screaming and turning away, discussing his family and his school years.
He also openly condemned the democracies on the committee, calling the charges against him "absordic and coordinated destruction of reputation" by organized liberals, who were upset at the fact that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
According to Pelosy, Cavanano’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice against the democracies.
"I think that these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the democracies, he will his own take away his candidature," she stated.
Pelosi was indignant when she was asked if she would try to declare Cavanano impeach, if his wine was confirmed, and whether the democracy would get most of the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI, it's not only good for working in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelosie.
Kavano currently works as a U.S. Court of Appeal in Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavano's possible decisions against the law of "Protected Medical Services" or "Roo v. Wade" because he was considered conservative by a judge.
In his hearings on the question of Cavanano’s confirmations, he sidetracked the question as to whether he would dismiss some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"Now is not the time when the judge is going to be hysteric, prejudiced and we will say how wonderful it is," said Pelosie.
Women must possess this weapon.
These were just words that contained the accumulated months and years of rage, and she could not utter them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," she said to me 45 years later, Miss Staine.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, do you?"
She continued: "One woman who worked somewhere as executive director and helped me very much said that she was crying when she was angry, but she had her own method, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the householder, "You might think I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
And I am evil."
And after that, she just continued.
I thought it was incredible."
The tears are thought to be part of what's allowed to happen because they're perceived differently.
One of the most vivid memories of my first job at the office, where men were mostly employed, was when I cried at one point in my anger, and the older woman, the poor manager, whom I had always been afraid of, grabbed me by the collar and pulled me to the horse’s cage.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will think that you are sad, and they will rejoice that they have come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Gart was caught aboard an extramarital boat called the Monkey Business, after which he emerged from the race, the deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for the presidency.
"It was not a very thoughtful decision," she said to me with a laugh after 30 years.
"The race already had seven other candidates and another candidate was the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation the White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in the congregation, so she made a promise that she would not take part in the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret their support of $1,000, gave her only $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she was surprised.
When she gave a speech and announced that she was not going to have a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system, which made it very difficult to collect money and forced the voters to go the wrong way to the councillors, the members of the Chamber of Deputies, and anger for sexism, and she was willing to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," said Miss Schroeder in the press response.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was thinking about, what would they write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How the U.S. - China business war can bring the benefits of Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S.-China trade war were desperate, and although far ahead of it, in the long run, Beijing could benefit from the long run.
President Donald Trump made the first pre-warning shots earlier this year, taxing Chinese exports, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminium.
The biggest situation was this week, because of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion ($150 billion), which actually tax half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing was paying back the same coin every time, recently putting a 5 to 10 percent mouse on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to taking similar U.S. measures, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to miss the opportunity to live up to this promise in the near future.
To force Washington to retreat means to accept the demands, but to the President of China, S. Jinpin, the public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, experts believe that if Beijing takes proper advantage of the situation, commercial war pressure from the U.S. might give China a long-term advantage by reducing the relationship between the two economists.
"A rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic collapse in any of the countries, and this is actually a greater threat than observers had acknowledged before," said analyst Egile Grace, who deals with Asia's issues at Center's analytic Center for New American Security.
Minister of Foreign Affairs stated that Syria is ready to return refugees
In Syria, refugees are said to be ready for voluntary return and to seek help in restoring a country devastated by the war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Walid Al-Mulam, Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the reality has become more stable and more secure as a result of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore terrorist - torn areas so that people can return to normal life.
At present, conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that has been abandoned by terrorism, as well as by unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and restricted their livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mulam stated that the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the war-torn country.
But he pointed out that they would not accept conditional help or help from countries supporting the riot.
Europe anchors its victory on Ryder's Rubber in Paris
The European team conquered the Rieder Cup in 2018, when the U.S. team won the top 16.5:10.5 on Le Holf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in European territory for the sixth time and has failed to win the Wyder Kubok since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Björn team gained 14.5 points to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Michelson, who did his best to try most of the tournament, hit his first long shot on the 16th hole of steam three in the water, and went Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever studied the 5-0-0 account since the modern tour started in 1979.
American Jordan Spith failed with account 5:4 from the lowest rating player on the European team of Turbiern Olesen from Denmark.
Justin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world rating, got to account 2:1 Jan Pauler of England, who may have been in the last-time Cup of Ryder.
The Spanishman Sergeo Garcia, a Reedera Veteran, who had already taken part in the tournament eight times, became a European who had won the most in all of the time in bringing 25.5 points in his career.
"Of course I don't cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad to have a cup back.
It's team merit, and I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia, not restraining her emotions after winning Europe.
He's handing over an estapheus to his countrymate John Remu, who won the American legend of Golf Wood in a lonely game on Sunday, with a score of 2:1.
"I feel an incredible pride for winning Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record for Reeder's Kubok, 13-21–3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who won the 14 Major tours, giving only to Jack Niklus.
The U.S. Congregation tried all weekend to get to the farm zone, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed high - class golf throughout the whole tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said about his team after the grudging performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we dominated Europe for a short time.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Players in US golf and the Council of the Rieder Kobok, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud of their captain.
They cannot be commended.
We lost."
