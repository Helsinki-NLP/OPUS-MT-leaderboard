China strongly opposes the adoption of the United States “Taybey Bill”
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called “Taibey Bill”, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
That was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the KWP for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.

“We call on the United States side to clarify the situation, to stop immediately moving forward negative legislations, and to cease immediately to interfere with the Taiwan issue in order to avoid further damage to Chinese-American relations, as well as to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait”, he noted.
China must and will be reunited.
This historic trend cannot be stopped by any one or any force, emphasized Ma Xiaoguan.
TikTok hides uncomfortable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under the age of 18 years.
Imagen China / Reputers
The Chinese social network, TikTok, provides censorship for video films that mention the Tiananmen area, the independence of Tibet, or the prohibited religious group Falungun, reports The Guardian.
Documents appearing in the publication tell us that the owner of TikTok (TyteDance) uses the annex to advance China ' s foreign policy objectives abroad.
Most of China's political violations fall under the “inflammation of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places up-to-date publications in a context appropriate to the general rules so that the activities of the social network do not look censorship.
For example, the prohibition of criticism of the socialist system in China falls within the general prohibition of “criticism or attack on the policies and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on the mention of incidents in the Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under “the search for the history of China or other countries”.
The document also includes a list of the prohibited names of 20 “Foreign leaders or public figures” including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong Ira, Kim Ir Sung and Kim Jong Eun, the Indian policy of Mahatma Gandhi, the American Presidents Donald Trump and Barak Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sinzo Abe, South Korea President Park Kinhe, President Joko Vedo of Indonesia and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by socialist administrators and may result in user locking.
Not too severe violations are in the second category: such publications remain on the website, but are limited to TikTok algorithms.
The representative of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules were outdated and no longer applied, "Now for modernization we use a local localized approach and attract independent professionals."
Russian users, TikTok, have no specific restrictions on publications, tells the co-founder of Ruste Boddan's "Proder Centre".
"Producer Centre" is a Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All of the bloggers' advertisements to the "Producer Centre" are in agreement with the social media, but they can be posted without agreement, and handed over to the Bogdans.
To the question whether TikTok could speak of politics or Putin, Bogdan responded positively and said he had seen such publications.
The founder of Our Didgital Roman Zarippov agrees with Bogdan: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: no shocking content, discrimination, etc.”
But these rules can be served by any content that does not like modernists, observes Zarippov.
Zarypov's agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under the age of 18.
The user agreement allows for the use of TikTok only persons over 13 years of age.
Socialists test their age by using artificial intelligence: neuroscientism analyzes faces and determines how long a person looks, tells Bogdans.
If nuns decide that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to the RBC, in September 2019, a office in Moscow was opened in the territory of the Koorki WeWork.
Istanbulans described the earthquake in the city
A severe earthquake caused panic in the largest city of Turkey
Last Thursday, 26 September, an earthquake struck 5.9 in Istanbul.
34 people were injured, 10 of them still in hospitals.
The resident of Istanbul, Melika, admitted that she had been panicked for the first time in her life.
"I cried so much.
She was eating right in the workplace.
Then it got easier, and I got back to business.
But I'm so ashamed now!' said the girl on TV, '360.'
“In Istanbul there was a real earthquake,
I can't go back yet!
But generally I'm OK," political scientist Jaylan Osgul gave me his impressions.
The project manager, Selin, noted that the mayor of the city kept everyone informed, but she said that citizens still felt a small magnet of about 3.2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the problem of communication in the wake of the earthquake.
The woman said she could call her mother anything, but the Internet was doing a great job and she was able to send a message through Whatsapp.
According to the kp.ru website, all kindergartens and schools were closed after the earthquake, from which all students were evacuated.
473 buildings were damaged.

Russia warned of false calls from banks
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of phone calls from frauds that replace the bank’s phone number.
Commersante reports this with reference to the Central Bank's data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator transmitted to the communication operators more than $25,000 of which phoned the clients of various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, operators found a replacement number.
Another 218 have been blocked, and 59 have restricted the use of financial services.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department, CB Artem Sychev, explained that a wide range of Russian banks had been replaced.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the alert of the Center for Fraud Call, referring to the absence of such an obligation in the Communication Act.
At the Open Bank, Rosbank and Alpha Bank confirmed an increase in the number of fraudulent calls replacing numbers.
According to Bilain's press service, part of the information about the CB's fraudulent calls was not correct: the lists are numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Locking them would lead to disruption in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev told me that Central Bank was planning to establish a fraud numbers database to which the communications operator would contact on every call to check the number.
He explained that such a framework would require legislative amendments.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and President Vladimir Greensky of Ukraine discussed Ukraine ' s membership in the alliance in the fields of the 74th session of the United Nations Gena Assembly.
This was described during a speech at Columbia University in New York City.
Replying to the question as to whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg stated that they had really discussed the issue and stressed that Ukraine had not been given the date of Ukraine ' s accession to NATO in its reply.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance had an obligation to meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, and said that RT had to write.
In Crimeu, the Green Alternative to NATO
President Vladimir of Ukraine, in place of the NATO accession course, should be engaged in good-neighbourliness relations with Russia.
This was reported on Friday, 27 September, by the Co-Chair of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinitz.
"I don't have to repeat the mistakes of the predecessor to the President of Ukraine, but I should take to the advice of the [President of the United States] Donald Trump, who was listening to the sour face, and to establish relations with the President of Russia,"
The Czech noted that Greensky was a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
He said that it would only be possible for the Ukrainian President to remain in power if relations were established with the Russian Federation.

Money is more important than football.
Barcelona blackmailes Neymar
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian football player, Neymar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the French attacker Parry Saint-Jerman.
The case was close to trial, but the Catalans proposed that the game be settled without Femieda intervention.
Otherwise they refuse to return.
Neimmar and his clever father, who is also an agent of Brazil, had an interesting focus: by agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he had to get Euro40 million.
However, in just one year, the forward ended up at the "PSW" for the record Euro222 million.
Nevertheless, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to pick up the remaining 18.
Notably, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest on late payment.
When Naymar's claims became known in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The Blue Grassows insist that the bonus relied on the performance of the entire contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, at the club, only a quarter of the Euro40 million was placed on the player and required a proportional portion of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer of Neimar and Barsa, there's almost an agreement on the return of a "fair" player to Catalonia.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope for the return of the trout remains.
Now, as Sports.Ru reports with reference to the insidants, the lawyers at the club told the player that if the issue of the financial claims was not dealt with in a pre-trial manner, it would rule out the possibility of the Brazilian being returned.
Neimar himself wants to come back so much that he asked for assurances that he would be bought back by the Catalans.

How to increase future pension and not recycle
It is not only the Russian Federation Pension Fund but also non-State pension funds that can pay the pension.
NPF is private companies, says Volgograd Truth.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and in time gives you interest back money.
If you are interested in this method, first look at the NPF website of the Bank of Russia.
All funds work under the same rules established by federal laws.
Pension points can be bought by law.
The number of missing points depends on how many years of service you will not have to pay your pension.
That's how it works for those who worked informally.
In addition, contributions may be made for a relative, such as a housewife.
Recommendation for those who consider pension at the beginning of their work path.
Increased pension benefits are paid by government officials, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have spent some years in the Far North.
Take care of this in advance so that you do not give up on the retirement age at all.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, deposit money.

At TNT, it was decided that the rapper Guff wasn't good enough for a "Boldy" show.
In the Network, they've been convicted for a few days, and it's worth a rapper Guff for being a new "House."
He was also reminded of his many vices and differences with the espresso, and even decided that he wanted to be rehabilitated for the scandalous music video "Moscow", which received a record number of dizzles from the audience.
But all the TNT authorities decided to put an end to all of the renditions together.
Guf won't be a new player in the "Boldy" show.
In an official statement, the press officers stated that he had considered the role but had finally chosen another candidate.
Who could be better than Guff?
Yes, in fact, anyone...

More respect for him.
I wish him luck in the future.
He's a real man.
When I hear this kind of support from the fans, I get really crazy about the cage.
It was really hard.
I tried.
I was talking about a show.
Did I promise a show?
Was that a show?
Thank you.
And to those who said I was out in the third round...
Ismail's speech was finished with a victory gesture.

What a club Paul Mamaev released from UD
Footballist Pavel Mamaev, released from the UDP colony last week, won't go back to the Redlist's football club.
An ex-protector of the club could soon sign a contract with the FK "Rost", reporting to the Chempiot portal.
According to the publication, negotiations between the representatives of the Rostov and Mamaeva are now in the final stages.
A 31-year-old football player contract is expected to be signed for two years with an extension of one more season.
"Sport-Express" says that Paul Mamaev had to undergo a medical examination earlier in Moscow's Dinama, but it was not due to the “uncertain situation at the club”.
Krasnodar terminated his contract with Mamaev last week on the parties' agreement.
A paralegal has played for a red-headed club since 2014.
He won twice with his team the bronze championship of Russia.
Mamaev used to speak in favour of Moscow's Torpedo and CSA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played for Russia’s collection of 15 matches.
Together with the Zenita player, Alexander Cochary Mamaev was convicted of participating in the fights in the centre of Moscow last October.

A man with a samurai sword tried to catch a cart found in a garbage bush
A resident of the United States city of Auckland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder following his samurai sword on his opponent in a dispute over a t-shirt found in the trash.
A 54-year-old, Curtis Miller, was digging into a pile of trash outside an empty house.
That's what Todd Bivers saw.
The latter decided to join in the search and found a black TV in amongst the castters.
Miller saw Bivers' find and got upset.
He thought he could claim to have started digging in the trash.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly Bivers grabbed the cart and ran with it to his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword that he had found in the same heap and pursued the opponents.
He drove Bivers around his house.
Miller pulled the sword out of the knife and began waving it in the direction of the cart.
Bivers told Miller that what happened was recorded.
When Miller noticed the camera, he ran away, but threatened to come back.
Bivers left the cart in the yard and walked into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw an unfamiliar woman going into his yard and taking away a cart shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller to drive a car without right.
The man was detained, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardison, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.
He thus responded that the guests at the wedding held at the same hotel where he stayed had not allowed him to smoke.
Mass Outbreaks on the Three
Moscow's case against the participants in the summer protests goes further, the more it breaks into fragments and loses political overtones.
The evidence of mass disturbances alone does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political solution, a weak evidence base would not necessarily have led to the withdrawal of charges.
The breakdown of the case should encourage society, but it would certainly leave the militants extremely angry, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining defendants under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disorder) - Alexei Minailo was suddenly released from custody without any obligation, and a few more hours later, and was completely rehabilitated: the SCR dropped charges against him.
Mini was detained for almost two months, followed by several professional communities — historians, priests, scholars, and scholars.
Since then, only two accused persons have participated in the riot (originally, 13 accused): Sergey Fomin, transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samaddin Rajabov, on the eve of the trial until the end of December (it is also charged with violence against a government representative, art. 318 KK).
The Court sentenced the author of the joking petition to join Latvia in the US
The Vodgian Presidence Court of Riga sentenced the author of the joke petition for Latvia ' s accession to the United States of America, Denis Bartek.
It is noted that a man was assigned 80 hours of correctional work and one year of probation.
"It's not the strongest part of our system that makes sense," commented the Bartetsk judgment.
He added that punishment is usually less than what is requested.
The collection of signatures of Latvia ' s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, along with this petition on the website, Latvia's signatures of accession to the "Galocic Empire" and the withdrawal of the country from the solar system and the Milky Way were collected.
It is noted that criminal proceedings have been initiated against Bartek under the first section of the country's Criminal Law, paragraph 82, “A public appeal to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.
Prior to that, in 2016, the author of the Internet petition to accede to Russia received six months of prison.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to punish police officers on the Internet
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has drafted amendments to the Police Act to protect the custody of order against the dissemination of slanderous and degrading information on the Internet.
On Friday, on the federal legal portal, an application for public discussion of the bill was made, and the draft instrument itself had not yet been published.
An explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honour and dignity of a police officer from “sensitivity in information and communications networks, including the Internet”, of a vicious nature, including those that are discrediting”.
How the police are supposed to protect themselves from slander on the Internet is not clear.
It is noted, however, in the explanation of the document that the amendment provisions will apply “through individualization of the mechanism”, an already pre-eminent Act on the blocking of posts that offend the authorities, and a law on penalties for such posts.
Both laws entered into force in March this year.
The final text of the bill will be published following public debate and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the Explanatory Note, amendments to the Police Act should enter into force in January 2020.
On 18 March, President Vladimir Putin signed a law punishing “extreme disrespect for the State” on the Internet.
According to this document, Roxcomadzor warns the resource about the violation and gives it days to address it.
The first violation of the prohibition is a fine of between 30,000 and 300,000 roubles and administrative arrest of up to 15 days.
On 12 April, Roxcomnadzor applied this rule to the media for the first time by blocking the Yaroslavic edition of 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Occult District Court of the Novgorod region fined 30,000 roubles local residents for placing in the network “two records of unfavourable information that offends human dignity and public morality and expresss a clear disregard for society, the State, the public authorities in the Russian Federation”.

Housing credit rates will fall to the end of 2019.
And Alexander Plunik, the director-general of the Dom.rf lending organization, says, "Interfax."

Earlier in September, one of the biggest players in the Russian mortgage market, Sberbank, planned another reduction in housing credit rates until the end of the 2019s.
Will phytosteregorins and phytoandrogants be able to prolong youth?
The phytoandrogen theme was not well researched.
Of the most famous are pine dust.
But the phytostherogens are well researched and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular, certain cancers).
All the known sources of phytoestrogen are bean (the most popular is soy, hmel, and sel.
On the other hand, many experts believe that such BADs cannot be a complete substitute for natural hormones.
There is no possibility of harming such supplements.
For example, in the background of their reception, the development of their own hormones may be reduced by the fact that too many analogies are produced from the outside.
The Governors called for the re-establishment of Kazakhstan's "Jenice".
The former attacker and Russia's assembled Oleg Veratennikov joined the campaign to re-establish the Kazakh “Jenice”.
The Astana Club, known in different years as Dinamo,Teleinnik, Astana and Genices, was disbanded in 2014.
The Vertents protected his colour in 2004 and 2008.

I couldn't stand it!
I spent one and a half seasons at this club.
It wasn't the best times for results and funding, but I'll never forget this club and his loyal fans, who have always been with the team!
There'll always be a memory of Munyatpasov's stadium, where I scored my 200th ball in my career!
Jenis has to wake up!
He's got a huge history and great fans.
I wish them all the best, and I believe that the City will bring back to them their own club."
"Bastion" launchs "Oikis" on the Chukokka missile.
It was the first time a winged rocket was launched from the Bastion compound in Chukotka.
Onenis started 350 kilometres away from the target and 200 of them flew over land, which is the record for this type of missile.
Some 10 warships and ships of the Pacific fleet, as well as naval aircraft, were secured by the shooting, and reported to the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the IRF.

Hidromett Centre called Faithful People's Puppets
There are many popular events in Russia where people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometre, all of the supposedly functioning receipts were checked.
Methorologists have concluded that only two can really be trusted, really in the short term.
According to the scientific director of the Russian Federation’s Hydrometre, Roman Wilfland, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will indeed be a feast, as our ancestors have noticed.
And if the sky shines white, it will be rain on the next day.
The second workout is based on bird surveillance.
More often than not, if they fly low, it's usually raining.
This is simply explained by the fact that when the humidity of the air is great, the mossows are crammed with wings and the feathers are forced to lower to hunt insects, writes the TLSS.
There are people's omens on different continents.
A surka day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, observed every 2 February.
On this day it is thought that we need to watch a horn coming out of our burrow to determine the timing of spring’s arrival.
Unknown oil stains were found on the beaches of North-East Brazil
Oil stains of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in north-east Brazil.
Pollution is spread over 2,000 kilometres of the coast.
Reports of the first detected oil stains began in the second September.
However, up to Thursday, the number has continued to increase, as has territorial coverage.
The Brazilian Institute for the Environment carried out a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out they're all identical and it's about crude oil.
In the State Petroleum Corporation of Petrrobras, which was transferred to analyse the samples found, it was stated that they did not correspond to oil extracted from deposits in Brazil.
"It's a thick oil.
It may be dropped from one of the vessels after the treatment of the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it was caught in the ocean cycle," she told the Brazilian G1 news portal, the oil union coordinator for Pernambuco and Paraíba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches, four of the eight affected states of the north-east of the country discovered nine sea turtles completely covered by oil tape.
Only two of them managed to save.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment, together with Pethrobras, will begin to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, institutions recommend that tourists and locals bypass oil stains and alert all found sites of pollution.
Medvedev commissioned a review of the business standards of general hospitals
The Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev, directed Russia to the Ministry, the Ministry, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to review health and epidemiological regulations and rules for general care organizations with the business company and the business community.
They will also have to explore the issue of the transition to nutritional requirements established by the Eurasia Economic Union.
The agency's proposals must be submitted to the Government no later than 15 October, and are listed on Mr. Medvedev's list of letters following the 11 September “Dialog” programme on “Russia 24”.
In addition, Mr. Medvedev instructed all departments, other than the Ministry, to submit proposals for a pilot to be conducted on 1 January 2020 to limit the control measures for general hospitals in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad.
The Ministry and the Ministry were mandated to submit to the Government, by 11 November, a bill amended to the CoEA concerning the application of administrative suspensions for violations of the requirements of nutrition, which had resulted in damage to health.
In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Economics, the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have to work on a gradual transition from 2021 to the development of a consumer basket based on a basic set of products to establish a full-fledged healthy diet.
Remember, the old standards of the business community's requirements were talked about after one cafe was closed down from UnderSon.
The business community demanded the repeal of the existing SPRN, and the Russian Federation announced the joint development of the new ones.
33 agencies were listed.
However, by 2021, Roswanazoor intends to reduce the number of sanitary standards and regulations by 40 times.
At present, the operatives are aware of the three murders to which the detainee is involved.
I got a man in the Skatatow neighbourhood of Tula.
He stole batteries and motorized vehicles from them.
Of the two vehicles, the VAZ-2106 and the BAZ-2107, the stealer took the batteries, allegedly for further sale.
"And another WAZ-2107 vehicle, for the same purpose, an abuser took away a car-magnetol and ababwefer," reported in the UMMA in the Tul region.
A vicious man may have intended to resale.
Currently, 26-year-old unemployed persons are detained.
Russia has nothing to do with the retirement of V. Matvienko.
The co-chair of the Federation Council of Valentine Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have sufficient savings to fully complete the bill on a guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing the pension from personal savings in the world is common.
Another matter is how timely our introduction is.
“In my view, a large part of the population now has income from which they have nothing to contribute to future pension increases”, stated V. Matvienko.
Russia, according to the Speaker, cannot understand the arrangements for the formation and assessment of the pension, since “responsible changes in this sphere have completely confused them”.
This does not mean that I am opposed to the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
“The Russia is a social State, and we must do everything we can to ensure that pensions, the social security of citizens are improved.
But steps in this direction need to be intelligent, responsible and responsive to domestic realities,” stated V. Matvienko, “REA News”.
The head of the FF stressed that if this initiative (the guarantee of pension product bill) was to be developed, several basic principles must be introduced, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and the State ' s strict guarantees and responsibility for the protection of pension savings.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced on 6 September the issuance of a bill on the guaranteed pension product (PRG).
Among its main elements are the purely voluntary procedure for citizens ' accession to the system of savings, guaranteeing the preservation of the long-term pension savings of citizens by the State, the registration of citizens ' accumulated accounts by the central administrator, business tax benefits and tax deductions for citizens.

" So it happened that he was the only superpowered hero to be found in different times.
So, as Sony continues to develop his own E.U., the future can be unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, who played the Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, delivered a extract from a movie called Wall Street in an Instagram, where the hero Leonardo de Caprio shouts, "I'm not leaving."
The controversy between companies was reported in August.
According to the media, Disnety wanted to get half the cash money out of the Man-Man-Man-Mans films, provided that both companies paid half the cost of making paintings.
But it wasn't Sony's.
News of the possible departure of a favorite superhero from the crowned Marvel caused anger in many loyal worshipers.
Details of the new conditions are not yet divulged.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: “We have cooperated perfectly for the last four years, and our joint desire to continue our work was commensurate with the wishes of many fans.
We are glad to be able to move forward together."
The "Messes: Finel" film, combined by the Spider-Man, Tora, Hulka, and other superheroes, became the most cashier in the history of the world’s film machine, moving from the top of Avatar.

Time to establish interregional links
The Committee of the Council of the Federation on Economic Policy summarized the regional information on its business development and legalization programmes, as well as the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions briefed the senators on SME development issues and made suggestions for the improvement of existing legislation.
“To date, communication between regions is not well established and the business community in all regions has identified the lack of information on regional programmes for the development of entrepreneurship across the country”, concluded Andrei Quetepov.
In the annex to the letter sent to the Government, he provided a summary of the region ' s positive findings on the legalization of self-employment and a summary of regional data with proposals and problems (available).
In addition to line ministries, regional summary data are also sent to the heads of the regional executive branch.
The exchange of information on successful practices in the regions could be an impetus for enterprise development as a whole.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” said the Senator's “Parliamentary Gazette”.
Helpful experiences

In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes to existing legislation should be made to support small and medium-sized enterprises more effectively.

In the field of Ivanian, amendments were needed to extend the list of activities undertaken by self-employed citizens, including separation and repair activities, long-term accommodations and physical training.

Avi Company helped passengers to avoid the neighborhood of weeping children
The U.S. Airlines carrier has set up a new function: in booking seats on the aircraft, you can now find out where small children are going to sit.
It is now possible to avoid them when you want them to be close to them.
Japan Airlines (JAL) passengers were able to take advantage of new options and avoid unwanted neighborhoods with small children.
The carrier has set up a function to track the location of the children.
When selecting the seat in the cabin, during ticket reservations, passengers will be able to see a picture of the child ' s head on the ground that children between the ages of eight days and two are employed.
Thus, those who do not want to fly near the babies because of the possible disadvantages associated with their crying may rest as far away from them as possible.
Internet users using airline services were thrilled with the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One jusier complained that he had flown from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and there were three weeping children sitting next door.
Another commentator proposed the introduction of "Jews for adults only," expressing his willingness to pay for such a move.
Many tourists noted that they would now try always to choose Japan Airlines for their movements, as they saw no pleasure in flying alongside a crying child in the closed space.
An earlier traveler with a baby tried to pick up the travellers during the Seoul San Francisco flight.

Paul Ustinov joined the pickups in support of the figures for the "moscow case"
Akter Paul Ustinov joined the "Freedom to All" series of single pickets, which take place on Friday at the President's office building in the Old Square in Moscow, and passes the Interfax correspondent.
The series of picketes began on 18 September in support of Ustinov himself, and has continued every day ever since.
At present, participants in the campaign, in change, are holding a poster in hand with the inscription “Freedom All” and the names of convicted and arrested persons following uncoordinated meetings in Moscow in the summer of 2019.

On 16 September, the Moscow Court sentenced the 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years of general regime for the charge of violence against OMO Naszgwardi, an uncoordinated act of 3 August in the centre of Moscow (art. 318 of the Criminal Code).
Thereafter, on 20 September, at the request of the General Prosecutor, the Court changed the Constitution's preventive measure from detention to non-departure.
So, the Ustinov release petition got more than 112,000 signatures per day.
The theater and the cinema began flashing on the side of a colleague.
In solidarity with the act of 18 September, the Old Square took a turn for participation in a solitary peak.
The case reviews were requested by human rights defenders, journalists, academics, teachers, doctors, Orthodox priests.
According to Interfax, Sister Ustin Yulia, her brother does not plan to speak at a meeting on 29 September in the capital in support of the figures for "moscow business".
The supply of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times.
In the Government of the Russian Federation, it was estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia had declined more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31,000 tons of products were imported from authorized countries against 3 million,442,000 tons in a similar period of 2013, reports Interfax.
However, the value of the imports decreased to $226.5 million, from $4 billion,975.5 million, respectively.
These are shipments of goods that were not embargoed.
As indicated in the report, the volume of prohibited products has been offset by increased imports from CIS, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.
We recall that, at the end of August, the Government extended the rules on the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited by the entry into Russia in the context of counter-arms, until 31 December 2020.
The document on the official legal information portal noted that the rules had been extended for one more year, from 31 December 2019 until 31 December 2020.
The destruction order was initially applied to products from the US, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Subsequently, since 13 August 2015, Ukraine has joined Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein since 1 January 2016.
Putin's decree on the destruction of illegally imported “sanction” (food embargo products which Moscow introduced in response to the Western anti-Russian sanctions) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has allowed the destruction of “sanction” food by any legitimate means.
As the West sanctions continue, the Russian Federation has also extended its response.
However, the measure is not applicable to products imported for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption of up to five kilograms.
However, Mikhail Fedotov, head of the Council of the President of the Russian Federation for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, had previously described the “just immoral” destruction of food, which he said would have had a negative impact on the upbringing of people.
Moreover, the initiative to ban the destruction of foods suitable for use had been launched in early June by Russil oversaw.
Since then, the Government has made a similar recommendation to the Human Rights Council of the President of the Russian Federation.

It will be drawn from 798 six-point segments of a range of 1.4 metres.
It's a huge mirror as well as two supporting reflecting surfaces of 4.2 and 3.75 metres in diameter will help E-ELT obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the Solar System, stars in other galaxies, and also search for the Earth's doubles.
In addition, scientists will try to use this Observatory to observe the surrounding areas of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
