The social map of the inhabitants of Ivanian region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes are intended to maintain the benefit of travel in public passenger transport.
Since 24 September, the arrangements for the provision of preferential travel by citizens using a social map of the inhabitants of the Ivanic province have changed.
According to the press service, the Russian Government in the Ivanic region, the changes provide for the maintenance of the fares for travel in public passenger transport and bring the social map into line with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 on the National Payment System of Payments.
At the same time, the social map of the inhabitants of Ivanian region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
For example, the replenishment limit is now set, not on travel as before, but on cash, on winter and summer periods of not more than 400 roubles of winter, summer not more than 800 roubles for the current month.
Social map holders will now need to monitor, not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of the funds available for transportation.
The cost of a concessionary journey for citizens would be 1/2 of the tariff applicable to the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is paid by the regional budget.
The figure for the replenishment of the social map remains the same, from 24 of the previous month to 23 of the current month.
A number of benefits will be derived from the new way of travel on a social map.
Thus, it is possible to maintain a detailed recording of the spending of money on a social map with accuracy to the copiers.
In addition, it is possible to recover credits, but unexpended funds.
Add, too, that the settlement scheme with carriers is becoming transparent, as now half the cost of travel is paid by the citizen and the same amount pays the carrier for the budget.
There will be no commission to charge money when entering the map.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, Deputy Chief of the Ivanic Department of Road and Transport, reported that more than 33 million social maps visits were carried out in 2014, almost 25 million in 2015.
In the regional budget, more than 470 million roubles are provided for privileged travel by citizens using a social map.
As at 1 September, reimbursements for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
At the time of the call, 911 teachers are admitted to the murder of a friend.
At a 911 call, the teacher at Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that staff were needed to come home.
Lamb emphasized that there was a "song" in the house that was alive, but was probably upset, and said that the family members of the deceased could be contacted in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prantis's body and a note unreservedly written on a white leaf of line paper, saying, "I'd like to go back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, "I'm sorry, I'd like to go back, and she was the only woman who ever loved me."
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who conducted two online courses at the University of Delta in Cleveland, Missouri, had been able to travel 300 miles to a university company where the police believed that he had shot all a respected professor of history, Itan Schmidt, on the threshold of his office.
The Chief of Police at the University of Delta Linn Bador reported that the university staff had learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call at 911 shortly afterward.
By the end of the day, the victims would be one more: the Lamb had killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the school cell shooting forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, officials still tried to draw the motives behind Lamba.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew him, helped to draw up a portrait of a talented but possibly concerned teacher.
The students told us that they were looking forward to his classes.
The police in Gothia, where Prantis died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal proceedings.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his book, in which he expressed appreciation for the “pretty people” he had encountered in his teaching life.
They both taught at the Department of Social Science and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures from both students.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well about Lamba, Brandon Bivers, reported that he also seemed nervous and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of his school year 2014-15 about how he was coping with stress.
Lamb used to ask Delta State University to give him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment rules had meant that the doctor’s degree, who had been so hard-working by Lamb, would not guarantee that he could automatically obtain a position as a teacher.
The president of the University, William Laforge, reported that he had no knowledge of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but, "No doubt, Mr. Lamba had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked the Lumba trail after he escaped from Campus when he was on his way back to Missouri from Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb shot 38 calibres in the back yard, one mile south of his parents' house in the suburb of Greenville, Missouri, reported to the coroner of Washington Bethel Johnson.
His engine car was still on the road.
It was not clear why Lamb arrived at the house, although she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
The Lamb grew up in those places.
Lamb began working at a university of 3,500 students in a city of about 2,000, teaching geography and teaching in 2009.
He received a doctorate degree in teaching science in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, cheerful man.
Karla Hasrston told her that she was 15 years old and Lamba 20 years old when she met her friend.
She and her friends went to high school, and he was a classed old man who had tried to teach her to play guitar for years.
During those years, it was a success for women.
"All the girls were hiding when he was around," says Harston, who is now 40 and lives in Jackson, the Brendon suburb.
Lamb and Prettis have probably met for some time by the moment of events.
At the time of the 911 call, Lamb said, "I've killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lighting, who lived with them in Gothia in a brickhouse with the opposite side of the canal.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
A former husband of Prantiss, Sean O'Stin, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and they have a daughter who is 19 now.
"She's really depressed," O'Stin told me about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter, Ebigyle, that Lamb was interested in music and playing blue.
Lamb met Prantiss when he and Abigail both spoke at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played the concerts from time to time together.
O'Stin says his daughter writes music and poets.
Prantis was a nurse and worked online for a variety of companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender and coroner, coordinator of entertainment programs in the light bar of The JuleRom in Gothier, said that he had seen Lamba and Prantis last time in the evening of 5 September, when Lamb had finished playing the guitar and the big mouth of the few visitors.
There was no suspicion.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and making fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very funny.
Schmidt, who had died as a teacher, conducted seminars for first-hand students and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same educational institution.
He was married and he had three little kids.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of student brotherhood and student self-government.
On Tuesday night, about 900 persons, including university professors, staff, students and members of the community, participated in a candle-thing memorial ceremony at the University of Delta University in Cleveland.
The wife of Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt were also present at a ceremony at which the university chorus was singing the Black Morning Star and the Amazing Grace.
The class will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
It's the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Missouri.
The report was assisted by the authors of Associated Press Emily Wagster Pattus in Greenville, Missouri, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a statement by the police that the Lamb's phone had been joined by 911 following the murder of Schmidt, and because, while Lamb had spoken about Prantis as his wife when he called 911, information that they had been married had not been confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to recruit fewer employees during the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that it will not hire the same number of employees for the holiday season as it did last year, while a rys R User of toys and goods for children shows that it would provide staff and temporary staff with more time to work.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and bulk bases throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 employed during the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be partially employed.
The company reported that it would start interviewing applicants this month and increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although a few months before the holidays, the buying season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have sufficient state in the stores and for sale, shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about dating with Princess Diana
The winner of Michael J. Fox' back to the future was a big event.
It was also noted for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in a movie theater waiting for members of the royal family to come, and I noticed that a place next to me was free, and it dawned on me to sit next to me, Princess Diana," he told me in a trailer shortly after a documentary, "Back in time."
The movie starts, and here it comes to my mind, that I'm literally at a distance of arms stretched out and in one false date date with Princess Wales.
Back in time, the documentary film "Back to the Future", includes interviews with Fox, Lye Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeks, and executive producer Stephen Spilberg.
The film back to the future was held 30 years ago.
"To me," says Spielberg, "it's definitely the greatest film about time travel that's ever been taken."
Back-to-time will be available on VAD, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
The head of the United Nations states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states, in response to Russia's military support for Syria, that “no military solution exists for almost five years' conflict”, and the increase in armaments will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The head of the United Nations once again called upon all participants, including the divided United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Mr. Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council - China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom - during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that differences in advice, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had “made the situation impossible”.
Mr. Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they had shown in resolving the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results that show that Donald Trump is not a joke
Some have tried to put a cap on it.
Others turned away from him, taking him as a joke.
And some people require a scandal.
But as some Republicans are trying to break up Donald Trump’s high position in the results of the interviews, they have not (until) managed to do so.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed the advantage of Donald Trump in double-digit numbers, and some are beginning to ask seriously what that means for a real estate magnet in terms of the chances of being nominal.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has the chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at that time, in 2011, Rick Perry had given up his superior popularity to Herman Kane, none of whom had won a single state in the process of change.
There are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups, such as the Jeb Bush Super Committee of Political Actuity, and the economically conservative group Growth Club, recognize the persistent force of Trump and begin bringing their dollars to absolve it.
Here are some of the numbers of the interviews that say the real estate magnet is not just an intermediate phase:
Trump's ratings are 180 degrees.
Immediately before Donald Trump sponsored his appointment in mid-June, a survey at the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 republics had a positive view of this real estate.
By mid-July, that was 40 per cent.
In early August, this was 52 per cent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive attitude toward Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have negative opinions.
All these indicators are up in the early stages.
Quinciac's survey in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of the Republicans there had a positive attitude toward Trumpus.
Two-thirds of those who voted for GOP would appoint Trump as a candidate.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67% of Republicans said they had either a "happiness" or a "satisfaction" if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two of 10 say they'd be built if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces approximately the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say that they would take glamour against 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
Next level of joy?
Marco Rubio, only 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republicans say that they will be “unsatisfied” or “unsolved” if Jeb Bush favours be a candidate.
Most Republicans do not view Trump as a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 per cent of republican voters throughout the country feel that the magnet is in a position to be president, as shown by the survey of ABC News/Washington Post held on Monday.
The same figure is found in the first closed congregation in Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of Republicans think he has the same person who could be chief commander, according to Quinciac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 per cent think that he is not the person who can be effective at the post, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperature is not appropriate for the White House, according to ABC/post.
Republic voters get used to that idea.
When they wear their head hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
To question who was the most likely winner of GOP, four of the 10 said that Trump was a favour, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
This is not the case when four of the 10 were putting on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Total desalination: GOP voters had not had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, whereas only 28 per cent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it shows that many GOP voters believe the Trump campaign is credible.
Even if the Republicans were united around another candidate, the Trump was still ahead of everyone else.
Some authorities indicate that such a spread is likely to be in the Trump advantage, while Trumpes who do not support are evenly distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical "one-to-one" competition between Trump and most other republican candidates, Trump almost always receives majority support.
He's ahead of Carli Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeba Bush at 19 points and finally Randa Paul, John Cassić and Chris Christi at 33 points.
He's got someone with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate he gets around?
Ben Carson has driven a businessman up to 19 points in a "one-to-one" hypothetical contest.
A little over half the supporters of Donald Trump say they've changed their mind.
A new survey of CBS/NYT, conducted on Tuesday, shows that only more than half of the U.S. voters supporting Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, much could happen and the situation could change, and no one could really say that he would never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, the most intense competition in Trump at the moment is with a neurologist of neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump named immigrants from Mexico as “violents” two months ago in his campaign, the issue of immigration became the most relevant in 2016.
Some are concerned that the Trump plant will turn key Latin American voters away from the republican party and interfere with the referendum.
But according to the ABC/post survey held on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts universal attention, Donald Trump appears to remain at the same position.
Frustration by the Government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on support from approximately half of the republican voters, mainly because of their outsourcing status.
Six out of 10 Republicans, on Monday of the new ABC/post survey, state that they want a political outsider rather than a person with experience in government work.
And they are also hurt in Washington.
A survey of the Das Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed by the Republicans' activities in the Congress, with 54 per cent “unsatisfied” and 21 per cent angry.
The Government will decide the fate of pension indexes in October.
Vice-Prime Minister Olga Holditz stated that the Government is now looking for options for the implementation of the Pension Indexing Act in 2016 to the real level of inflation, and refers to the WG.
It noted that a solution should be found by 8 October, at the time of the introduction of the draft budget for the next year to the Government.
In addition, the cabmine discusses the option of enshrining the freeze decision on the cumulative pension of the Russians.
The colder noted that the pension savings amount to 350 billion roubles.
The total number of pensions indexing is approximately the same for the following year.
According to the Vice-Prime, there is as yet no definitive solution to the question of who should pay the contributions for non-working citizens.
If a person does not work on his own initiative and does not take it, he believes that it is not entirely fair to pay for it by society, as socially vulnerable citizens.
Previously, the media reported that the cab is considering two options for balancing the State ' s budget.
Why are they often irritable and red - colored?

Pyongyang claims that Korean cores created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the Jonben nuclear complex, was operating “at full power”.
This was reported on the country’s Central Telegraph Agency Web site.
It is noted that the DPRK is prepared at any time to respond to “aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “in terms of quantity and quality”.
The North Korean authorities conducted the last nuclear-weapon test in 2013.
However, there have been no plans to restart the reactor since then.
He claims that he was able to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has conducted numerous mid-range and low-range missiles tests, writes Polit.ru.
Zirinowski demanded that the reference to the fraternal peoples be removed from Russian gymna.
The leader of LDPR, Vladimir Zhirinski, believes that the reference to the alliance of the brotherly peoples should be deleted from the national gymna.
He said that during the State party meeting, he reported on the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"The longest anthem, the longest in the world, even the athletes can't stand," said Zhirinsky.
It is the opinion of the delegation that all four-tenths of the line must be removed:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinski stated that the current gymnae needed to be replaced by "God, king, preserved" and the Russian tricol was replaced by an imperial flag, writing polit.ru.
Asaad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
President Bashar Asad of Syria called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Aad is confident that if Europe is to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question was not that Europe accepted or did not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem needed to be addressed.
If the Europeans care about the fate of the refugees, let them stop supporting the terrorists.
That is our view on the issue.
"That's the point of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue for consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible for people to die while the bloodshed continues and people do not feel completely secure.
"So we can reach consensus, but we can't do anything unless we win terrorism in Syria," Assad said.
Let us recall that some 500,000 migrants, including those from Syria, arrived in the European Union during the year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world was the largest since the Second World War.
Thousands of extremist fighters from the “Islamic State” faction may be among the arrivals in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use a situation to establish their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
German city residents held a celebration for the refugees.
In the last month, Germany had become the leader of the reception of refugees, although it had recently strengthened border controls to contain their influx.
The authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts call them significant numbers.
Since the beginning of September, over 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
The BBC Correspondent, Jenny Hill, visited Darmstadt City, whose residents are very welcome to migrants.
Jeremy Corbin debuts to the Prime Minister during the session
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut at the session, the Prime Minister is looking forward with great anticipation
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon speak to the Prime Minister for the first time in an effort with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak on the first of six questions on the afternoon; he will likely be closely monitored by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for “a smaller theatre and more facts” on a weekly demonstration talk.
He also stated that he might miss certain meetings by leaving them to their colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as leader; it will take place after he has been appointed a shadow office and spoken at the Tred-Junion annual convention on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Leader to remain silent during his national hibernation on Tuesday, during his 75th anniversary of Britain, criticized several conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several leading articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the State anthem attracted attention
The Spokesperson, Mr. Corbin, said that he “reserved in near silence” and acknowledged “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in Britain”.
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the shadow Cabinet, advised Newsnight on BBC 2, that he would advise the leader of the Leborists to sing the national anthem “independent” from his belief in the need to cancel the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbin's team, disputing on economic, defence and international policy issues, while less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC Robin Brent said that political differences would also be “tackled up” in the Labour Party following Mr. Corbin's appointment to office in the European Union and the Government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Tred-unione conference that the Labour Party had amended the very idea of limitations in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Shadow Minister of Labour and Pension, stated that the party had “full clarity” on its opposition only to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Lebies, with whom David Cameron will meet at the “Courier's box” in the last 10 years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Leader of Labour, who has promised a different approach to politics, states that he has “involved collective resources” in order to gain Mr. Camón's ideas and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Member of Parliament of the Aileton North District stated that the Prime Minister ' s questions were causing excessive confrontation and that he would refrain from scrupulous responses and the exchange of cynicities, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Igle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him on the matter of the Prime Minister when he was absent, for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also came up with the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had addressed the Speaker of the House of John Burkow Community to discuss the matter.
He had become a leader in 2005, but he had admitted several years later that he had failed to do so.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister has been a key indicator of leadership, its ability to manage the Community Chamber and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires major reforms.
"Sunned in Johannesburg" by homeless young people who studied in photographers
Johannesburg Business Center is a difficult place for homeless people.
But a group of former street people have found a way to develop a trade and a livelihood.
"I was filmed in Johannesburg," a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of their surroundings and to earn on it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Rising wages in the United Kingdom
The cost grew against the rising wages of the United Kingdom, and the FTSE 100 index was raised by the proposal to purchase SABMiller.
Between May and June, earnings in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9 per cent compared with the same period last year.
Growth rates have been highest since 2009 and were met as a shift to earlier projections of possible plant growth.
The Pound of sterling has grown by more than 1% against the dollar by $1.5505 and 0.84% against the euro by €.13730.
The FTSE 100 index grew to 6229.21 per 1.49 per cent.
The general background was SABMiller shares, which grew by 20 per cent through a purchase proposal from a competitor for AB InBev.
The deal would unite the two world’s two largest brew companies, collecting brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burgerry shares have increased by 0.9 per cent in the face of encouraging news from the competing group of commodity producers of the class of Luchemont.
Recent figures on Richemont's sales exceeded expectations and showed that sales in China -- in the key market for Burton -- began to rise again.
Glencor shares grew by 5 per cent after a mining giant declared that it was able to receive $2.5 billion through the allocation of shares, as was done under the debt reduction strategy.
The Montdi's share of the paper and packaging group was the fall-in-index leaders - by 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs had reduced the group's rating to the “sale”.
Shares of JDS have grown since the sports clothes supplier reported a 83 per cent increase in income before the six-year tax to £46.6 million.
Chief JDSports says higher wages can hinder expansion.
The Executive Director, JDS Peter Kaugill, says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means “a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the higher cost of labour, he says.
The costs could have affected plans to expand JD Notes, adding which could mean a decrease in the number of additional vacancies.
Metash runs a bottom campaign to fight Aldi
Metash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
The best food provider launched a bottom-up campaign to protect the market share of IGA railers in South Australia and Western Australia, in the light of the impending presence of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 shops in South and West Australia at the beginning of the next year, Metash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand by marketing in leading media and social networks and at the Adelaside Show type.
The campaign has been joined by the filmmakers and IGA providers, such as the ice cream manufacturer Simmo's from Dansboro, who offers to dehumise in IGA stores, and the shopkeepers who sell a flat ticket to the football League of South Australia.
Metash is expected to expand its protection strategy to more detail on 29 September, a day when the bulk supplier will spend its annual investor strategy.
There is a high stake in South Australia and Western Australia ' s IGA shops make up almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show greater profitability than the IGA Metash network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as committed to conventional routes, so the market is more favourable to IGA filmers than were those in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in the USA, and 24 per cent in the WA, compared with about 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will absorb 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first shops, taking over the sale of all players present, but mostly independent filmmakers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst, Morgan Stone, believes that the IGA can lose $360 million a year in sales, while Metash, $250 million by the end of 2016.
Projections are based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA next year and 30 in WA when sales of $500 million and $600 million in those markets, respectively.
The losses and volume of food sales at the high constant cost of Metash may cost companies some 13 million incomes before paying interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat considers.
At the same time, Metash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly owing to Aldi and Colas, and this is true of the recent study by Morgan Survey that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
At Morgan State, it is believed that the sale of Metash food will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company ' s share in the market from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading stock manager, Hemish Douglas, founder of Magella Financial Group, noticed the presence of a business lunch in Melbourne that a "metash" could be very likely to disappear within a decade.
The Metsash company refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the Board of Directors of Metash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The IGA share of the market has fallen from 18 to 14 per cent in 2010, and Metash ' s business revenue from food business, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA-recruitors, has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 due to the operational services office and due to pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million a year to compare retail prices to the prices of the Coles and the Volworths at thousands of posts every week, and helping IGA film-makers to renovate trading sites, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh food and a wider selection of commercial food products.
The Director-General of Matthews, Ian Morris, said that the price balance and the improvement of trading areas was on the rise, and he hoped that the company would achieve an increase in net profits in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Tennessee Australia Steve Healy
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly affected by the recent scandal around his friend Nick Kirios and for his conduct he deserved more honor than the critics of Australia's Tennessee Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a young man in a talented dueate and often called "Special Ks," was a bit of attention because of the shameful overspray of Kirios with Stan Vavrinka on the Montereal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during the hot qualification match at the Cincitanate, the judge in the tower had to take Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "The Vavrinka was supposed to be placed on the blades of Kirios, and I have to put it on the blades of this guy."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen by a grooving rocket after the boat in his leg saved Ryshar Gaske from the possibility of a US open attack, Heli is loyally defending Kokkinakis.
A young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grott for being the second after Bernard Tomić, in the semi-finary of the Cup of Davis against the United Kingdom.
"I'm really worried about one thing, that Tanasi got involved in the conflict," Healy said.
He really broke a rocket when he had a foot down on US Open, but he's not the first player to break a rocket when hope broke down, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at a pretty provocative situation in the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, and he's got a beautiful family, and I just think he got a little unfair.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, he's a great team member, he's never had a problem with other players, he's being considered outside the court, he's being intensively trained, he's in great shape, he's a very dedicated and developed young person, and I think he should be valued by dignity.
He also supported the decision to forgive Kirios for an important match starting on Friday, placing “by mutual agreement” on the right way for everyone, but hoping that the fellow from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term player.
"We do not want the team to concentrate entirely on the match, but not on the disputes around [Cyrios]," Healy said.
And I think that Nick gained power very quickly, which is being proved by people like Federer and Marrey, he's growing up in front of the public, he's made a series of serious mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think I need to get him out of the focus for a while, so that he can reflect on them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closures the border, detains migrants
Announcing the state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detained those who attempt to enter the country illegally to contain the flow of migrants.
There have been disturbances along the border - hundreds of migrants have packed themselves into border territory, and the Serbian authorities have reacted sharply.
Uncertainly on the road between the two-country checkpoints, the people who fled armed violence in their homeland broke their tents and settled in the area.
However, there is a problem.
When a police helicopter was wheeling over them, migrants shouted "Open the border" and shouting insults against the special-purpose Hungarian police.
Some protested against food and water.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia has declared “unacceptable” the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when they are more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution of the problem, not the accompanying damage.
There is a need to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days” in Prague, Ivica Dachić.
The troops at the Hungarian-Serb border began the day after a block of 28 countries had failed to formulate a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that in the future (the following month or by the end of the year), an agreement would be reached that European Union member States would receive another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
The chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel and Austria, on Tuesday, demanded the convening of an emergency summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis that covered the continent.
Hungary does not, however, look forward to swift action by Brussels or by its neighbours.
The state of emergency announced on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to deal with the crisis, enabling them to close the roads and expedite the asylum case.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Minister of Hungary, Peter Cyarto, stated that his country was also planning to remove a barbed wire from a section of the border with Romania in order to stop the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had finished the fence on the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were engaged in urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “fest” place and the European Union border crossing point for the settlers, many of whom are refugees who are victims of the war in Syria and in the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, insists that most of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees, who are victims of war, who are entitled to protection, and that view is very different from the views of other EU countries, Germany.
New laws entered into force in Hungary at midnight are now regarded as a crime of crossing or damaging a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed fence built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison terms for the accused in human trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency," said a representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovac in the southern city of Segeed.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
A formal parliament must still authorize the deployment of the military, which is expected next week, but the reporters of Associated Press, which are on the border, have been watching the presence of soldiers armed to teeth with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Dear Bacondi, Adviser to Orban National Security, reported that 45 persons trying to cross the border at the border and 15 others at the domestic level had been captured by authorized authorities.
They crossed the border, breaking the fence, currently detained by the police and accused of administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities quickly re-establish the fence.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passageways along the border with Serbia, oppressioning one of the passageways by a railway wagon wrapped in barbed wire.
The riots broke out at the main crossing of Ryoske, Hungary, as Hungarians placed office rooms to pass people inside the metal container, and crowds pressed one another to break through.
About 20 people were able to get inside, while thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road transport from Serbia to Hungary and announced that food and water had not been available until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton’s preference over Bernard Sanders was halved in the national survey
The former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold on to two-digit advantages in a democratic race for dominance throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders will catch up with her.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of primary Democratic voters (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders is the second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Baiden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 per cent of the primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the beginning of competition in the primary elections, most Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they have decided with the candidate they will support.
Supporters of Clinton are more confident of their choice than of supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders achieved some bonuss.
Clinton holds a large advantage among women and the moderate, but this has decreased.
Her support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders has only five points behind.
The preference given by Clinton to Democratic voters up to 50 years of age is gone, and they and Sanders are on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month Clinton had a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has 5 points in this group.
Almost half of the original democrats throughout the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her only because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not have supported it.
It may not be surprising that the present Clinton supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm on her account.
Among those who at present do not support Clinton, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter of them would ensnare her enthusiasm.
While 48 per cent of the original Democratic voters say that they would have enthusiastically supported Clinton, the smaller number of Republican voters is talking about their leader, Donald Trumpe (35 per cent).
When the Clinton supporters are asked an open question about why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), then, that she is the female president's time (13 per cent), and that she is the best candidate (10 per cent).
Klinton’s supporters also speak of an association that links her with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called agreement on questions and chances for election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary Democratic voters would like him to join the race - although a third does not think he should.
When they are asked who they would like to see in the second place among party candidates, the primary Democratic voters are commonly referred to as Baiden.
Among the Klinton supporters, over half says they'd choose Byden the second, it's more than Sanders's.
If Baiden chooses not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Baiden to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of democracy voters see a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning the general elections; however, that figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
This is where Baiden is far from second, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in response to the question that is most important in the candidate, the democrat elects other options than the chances of being elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the candidates from democracies or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee to these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some of the key features of their party's primary voters.
Most believe that Clinton, Sanders and Baiden are honest and credible people with good leadership qualities.
Baiden of all three looks honest, and Clinton's strong side in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary democrats do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a definite view of it.
Primary democrat voters also generally regard the same ideological views as those of Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
In all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
Although the questions about the personal E-mail box and server of Hillary Clinton are still in the home of its State Secretary, most of the primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this has not adversely affected their general opinion on her.
But it's a completely different story from that of the American public in general.
Half of Americans today are not satisfied with its explanation, but only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided back in March, shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say that the debate about e-mail has had no effect on their general opinion about Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion of it has deteriorated.
They're mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 people who claim their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers the voters of her party to be honest and credible, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider her to be honest and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it to be honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be honest and credible.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good leadership marks.
Of the six testees, Baiden, Carson and Bush have a better record of honesty.
Most people see Sanders as honest rather than honest, but, like Carson, many have no idea of him.
The error limit for a sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
As a result of the national survey Ben Carson got closer to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson got close to Donald Trump in the last survey of CBS/New York Times
The two candidates picked half of the voters in the new survey, leaving all the others looking for the support under their feet
Republic voters throughout the country continue to support the Trump, the percentage of which increased from 23 per cent in a recent CBS survey held prior to the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in a Tuesday survey.
But Carson took off in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoyed support in all demographic groups by pushing Trump into a higher education voter group.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Karli Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Kasic, retreated back with Governor Viskin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
The former Governor of Florida, Jib Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hakabi, and Senator of Florida, Marco Rubio, come together in the third place, with 6%.
The number of errors for a sample of 376 republican voters in this new survey is plus-minus 6%, and the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed Carson's growth in surveys, showing 19% support for Republicans, at Trump with 32% support.
ABC News/Washington Post also showed that the Trump is far ahead of Carson.
In view of Carson's increased support last week, Trump made several critical attacks against the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for having questioned Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the closing campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of the first class of the Baruch College
About two years after the death of a college student, five people were charged with murder at the Ponano fraternity ritual in the Pocono Mountains.
"Pe Delta Psy's sister at Baruch New York College attacked Chan Maclah during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and failed to take him to the hospital on time, causing his death," reported to the police.
Officials say the student with blindfolds and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times while he was trying to reach the goal on a sliding surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Pe Delta Psy did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they were waiting for an hour before they took him to the hospital to talk to the police.
They found time, however, to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Mengo, the national president of the brotherhood, to ask the advice, as told by Chief Chris Wagner at the press conference.
"At this point, the members of the brotherhood began to hide personal property, essentially by putting the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to save him, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng sustained several blunt injuries to his head, toes and thighs.
“A lot of families have suffered as a result of the dedication rituals, since at least one student dies every year since 1970” said Douglas Feierberg, a lawyer representing the Dang family.
Brothers and their members must be responsible, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe Countys have bent towards a third-tier murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against newcomers and conspiracy.
“We want to bring not only individual participants to justice, but, if there is an organization that authorized this, either formally or informally, but also,” said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College banned brotherhood, and the local branch was removed from its structure by the national brotherhood.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in rates, and bull market will collapse, bond returns will grow and the economy will collapse into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take before the attack, and how long will it last?
Specific to the economy, history has little to explain about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first appreciation of the rate and a whole of 86 months.
The existence of the Federal Reserve in the promotion of rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
The U.S. Central Bank Administration therefore insists that investors should not focus on when they start raising rates, but on how much adaptation will take.
Actually, there's a lot of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole turmoil around higher rates is exaggerated.
“The first increase in rates by the Federal Reserve, with the outbreak of the global financial crisis, will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the "cost money" era,” said Julian Jessop, chief international economic expert at Capital Economics, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to a more normal level, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here's how some areas of the economy might have reacted, depending on historical trends:
As already seen by the market in the last month or so, waiting for higher rates can lead to some volatility for some time.
However, the impact is not usually such a dramatic one when the rate is raised.
"It's not like equity revenues are suspended between 12 and 24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," said the analysts Deutsche Bank in a recent study of the results of the increase in rates by the Federal Reserve.
If more specifically, the market has changed sharply over the past some 35 years, about 14 per cent upwards, and remains fairly flat within 250 days (average 2.6 per cent), then back to normal, with average income of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to a recent study by Bob Doll, the chief sharer in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities does not tend to immediately become more pronounced at the upwards stage, and equity revenues are beginning to decline.
The recessions are a fact of economic life, but higher rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is subject to conditions that were not previously in existence and that could accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be located at almost its lowest point during the entire period of the high rate.
Deutsche Bank claims that in 118 cases, the increase in rates since 1950 was only twice the nominal annual GDP of 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that this is a long time, with only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such a volatile economic background may be risky and raises the question of “whether this time will be different”, reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to increase federal reserve rates throughout the year, with their eyes attached to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
So far, many strategy experts and economists believe that FOMC could approve rates increases at this meeting, future trade indicates only 25 per cent probability.
"In our study from 1950 on, the entire rate increase cycle until today has been in a super-heavy cycle of increasing financial leverage for GDP, closing the peaks of the recession very quickly after the start of recovery," the report states.
In contrast, this was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record is 35 months, and it's all 74 months and it's not over.
The fixed income has also become unstable while the market looks forward to higher rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one being implemented for shares.
The policy difference is that for bonds the effect will be faster than for equity when the Federal System changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the return changes the vector immediately after the first increase/reduce in the cycle.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, the bond returns immediately fall,” reports Deutsche.
Charles Schwab strategy specialists believe that higher rates would bring long-term and short-term bonds together to make the curve more flat.
High-income bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we are still afraid of income fluctuations”, says Cathy Jones, a study of fixed income analystism in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal System policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are signs that the market has looked towards a more stringent monetary policy perspective”, she wrote.
The interest rates on short-term loans rose, the yield curve was flatter, credit spread, the volatility increased, all the features of the market when the policy of the Federal System was tightened.
Generally speaking, companies leading their business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with multiple debts will be in a worse position because the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt more expensive in financial terms.
"The history shows that `quality' shares demonstrate efficiency above the market within three months of the initial appreciation of rates," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a customer report.
Stable financial companies have bypassed fragile companies on average, at 5 percentage points, as a result of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
High-income companies, as well as low-lying stocks, have also proved to be better off than low-quality shares by an average of 4 (percentage) and 3 (percentage) respectively.
It's gonna be a big question.
High-interest floating-rate debt companies are most likely to lose out, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
The contributors could also see the profits from higher returns, although the experts differ in how fast this will take place.
"BBC Radio 3 - copy of Classic FM" - A member of Parliament from the Conservatories of Andrew Bingham
Member of Parliament of Conservatives Andrew Bingham criticized the station for “a decline in standards”
It proves to be less and less different than a commercial competitor
Also directed at BBC Music Awards, saying the prize is solo with the British
The House of Parliament, Damien Collins, which was hit by The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM," said the leader of Parliament, urging the television company to prove that she is doing something she doesn't do to commercial companies.
A member of Parliament from the Conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also said to the BBC leadership that the public radio station seems to be “supplete” and is becoming less and less different than its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems like I don't like to use the word "simplification" -- but it looks like it's turning into a Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Award launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which was dated last year, looks like The British, called the other name.
So if you're trying to do something else, these are two examples that first came to my mind, where you're really only copying what's already on the market,' said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BCC rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial rival when it came to living music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live speech and music really doesn't match anyone else.
"So very important, I think Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new pieces," he said.
Earlier this year, the BBC Radio 3 manager, Alan Davey, claimed that radio stations had to work a lot more to attract the audience than in the past, because British people are less educated in classical music.
Radio 3 was not, however, the only child who had been attacked by BBC for attacking five commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Member of Parliament, Tori Damien Collins, attacked The Voice, the BBC music talent show, which BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an indicative price of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because of the lack of originality and characteristics?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Palma Faith and Boy George participates as judges, was made into the "BBC typical style".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "found a hit in her own house room" the next time she started a fun project.
However, he does not find it necessary to prevent the order of the new seasons The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those paying the licence fee into other entertainment formats.
The increase in Internet sales slowed fast as soon as possible in August, and it could be Black Friday.
During the first three months of 2015, there was an increase of 7 per cent in online sales
The past month has seen its slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago using pinping mobile devices
Experts are convinced that November's Black Friday could help contain the waste
Virtual shopping has had a boom for about ten years, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs of equalizing online sales, after the latest figures showed only a 7 per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August showed a minimum increase since it began to be recorded in 2000, only five per cent more.
Experts say that evidence of equalization of online sales has emerged since the latest figures showed only a 7 per cent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to the 2000s, they've always found a reasonable explanation."
He explained that online sales had intensified three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's going on the plateau, and you can see the decline.
Black Friday, who came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowing down of sales.
Experts believe that buyers may have refrained from buying prior to the event of last Friday November.
Last year, buyers made five times the average speed on computers to make use of profitable offers, thereby disrupting a number of sales websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter a real battle for a profit, could force people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Restail Consortium, just over £1 per pound is spent online.
For products such as television and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through the Internet.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online than in fashion stores on central streets.
Muslims are burying those killed in the fall of a tap in Makkah and the Ben Laden family is subject to sanctions
Muslims sell the bodies of 29 dead in the streets, as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the accident for the construction giant Sadi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also injured after the tap had broken down
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the street were going to bury 29 of the victims who had died as a result of the tap crashing on the Mackka Mosque.
Dressed mainly in white, those present at the funerals filled the carriage in order to pay tribute to the first of the deceased who departed on their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A sad procession passed by the sacred place where a building crane had hit a mosque ceiling just a few days before, and it fell on a alien.
The bodies were issued for burial, while King Saudit fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 people who died when the tap in the Master Mosque was broken down in the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Kasim Akram, from Bolton, Grand Manchester, who was in his first pilgrimage when the kran hit.
Mr. Akram was at the Chief Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the haj will continue as thousands continue to enter the city.
King Salman said today that Binladin Group shouldn't have left the arrow of a tap up at a non-working tap.
An Arab version of a decree published by the State Agency Saudi Press states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of an offence.
The English version of the news agency did not describe this detail, but indicated that company leaders were prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the fall of the tap into the courtyard of the Chief Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to the hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the tap violation and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of failing to use modern security measures and inadequately harmonizing with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the extensive construction work being carried out by Binladin Group.
For decades, the bin Laden family has been among Saudi Arabia ' s nearest ruling family and has been leading the largest construction projects.
Al-Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a changeable son from whom the family rejected in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, which is compulsory once in a lifetime for every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about £174,000) to the relatives of the deceased and the same amount irreparable.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q states that the trend is due to the existence of Eastern European workshops for small money
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair experts
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screfix shops for specialists
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q warehouses throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, main urban correspondent, Daily Mail
British people are said to be putting away the hammers and the handicrafts and instead hire qualified East Europeans to work in the house
If you are able to approach the hammer or to climb the walls, it seems as if you are in a minority today.
Because, according to the owner company B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring Masters to do a simple housework.
The new Director-General of Kingfisher, who owns the building services network, said that the trend was followed by a significant influx of skilled workshops from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Scewix shops specializing in handicrafts and at the same time close 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Laurie told me that she would like to see more women in the B&Q shop staff, as eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by weak women.
At present, the majority of staff are men.
She said that the latest demographic trends, characterized by an increase in the number of single women who were more involved in the construction of their homes than in the past, could not be overlooked.
Mrs. Laurie said, "Our shops still work mostly for men.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of our choices are made by women.
Women play an important role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of the five women who managed the leading British companies whose shares are recorded in FTSE100, also changed the composition of the top management team by reaching the directors of equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is hardly the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director General and the Director-General.
Ms. Laurie said, "It was a deliberate solution, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was not easy.
After the group took the cost of closing the shops, Kingfisher showed a decrease in the profits and sales for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher owns 200 new shops, owned by Scurefix and B&Q
Time of decision at US Federal Reserve interest rate
The world is watching a meeting by the Federal Reserve Bank, which has been discussing a crucial decision within two days, whether or not to raise the interest rate for the first time in the past decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters revealed that just over half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believe that it will continue to update and maintain the rate at the current range of 0 to 0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach that the main bank can move from zero to start the process of normalizing interest rates,” stated Angel Ubide, the chairman of the Peterson International Economics Institute.
The U.S. economy works effectively, the economic recovery adds trillion dollars to the balance sheet and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the effect that a decision will have on the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for change, but everyone says that they are sure that they are in a position to resist such a step.
A decision will be announced at 20.00 CEET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
Open it up, hundreds of refugees are scandalous at Horgos on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Budapest closed the settlement border from Tuesday.
Asylum-seekers are beginning to leap through other routes to the European Union.
One of them along the closed border with Serbia lies through Romania.
Another through Croatia and Slovenia through Austria.
According to some data, buses carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now headed for the town of Shid on the Croatian border.
Drivers have been authorized by the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebosha Stephanović, assures him that his country does everything it can to help the refugees, but its opportunities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people and ensure that they are treated humanely.
But it's a pan-European problem.
It is difficult to resolve, no country in Europe will do so alone, and much less a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán is like,
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia it must fill the necessary documents.
And if he does not, he will not be allowed to enter our country either, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already taken a 175-th-metre fence along the border with Serbia.
But Orban has no intention of stopping this; he is planning to erect a similar fence along the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Johns Maimarakis, Europe wants to help us.
The evangelism of Mayarakis has for a number of years entered the country's legal governments, which, in the opinion of the left, have led to a financial crisis.
He is now the temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, challenging Cyprasus.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist, Euronius.
Mr. Maimarasis, welcome to Euronius!
I thank you for your invitation.
Euronius: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by the coalition of Siriza, but now, according to polls, the New Democracy equaled it to popularity.
What's changed in this time?
Michael Maimarakis: Greece has changed, and so are we.
Mr. Typras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a fiscal surplus and prospects for economic growth.
The country now has a once again fiscal deficit and a high level of unemployment.
Investors left because Mr. Cypras drove them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greek people have had the opportunity to assess the situation in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsiros.
And now they can easily compare what they have promised with what actually happened.
All day long, life has been markedly worse than January, when the situation has improved, with most Greek citizens.
But you're saying that if you win an election, you're going to pursue alliances with other parties, including SIRIS.
I am writing to Maimarasis: The fact is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, political forces and all ruling parties have met together to implement the programme on which they agreed without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of the political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronius: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsiros and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new prime on Monday, will you comply with the agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
evangelism Maimarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece ' s movement on the European way, because we had a good picture of the disastrous consequences of the country ' s withdrawal from the EU.
Europe now helps us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package, and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there had not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current tight economy was the result of Mr. Cipras negotiating.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government, during the first year, wants to bring about order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all commitments made, which cannot be fulfilled because of the recession, can be renegotiated again, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of operation of the new agreement, we can return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to benefit from EU funding and from the greater investment opportunities that we must provide for a better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of the negotiations, the Government of Tripras has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have clarified in discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I'll give you an example of farmers' income.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, so it cannot be completely taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Tripras had never heard of it.
Hence, the Greek ministers were neither prepared nor informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronius: If you win the election, you will soon be at a table with Mr. Junker, Oldland, Lady Merkel, and other European leaders.
Will your predecessor, Anthony Samaras, differ from what you tell them?
I will explain first to them that before the end of 2014, we were trying to implement the 2012 agreement best by bypassing the sharp corners in it.
We have moved the reform process forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in an emergency.
The market had fallen, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek government.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which formed the majority of the government.
Despite their serious ideological differences over key bills, we had a working parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations from outside.
And we have managed to lead the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve had the process not been interrupted by the long-term general elections that were the result of the December presidential elections.
Euronius: A massive refugee stream is moving across Greece for the last weeks.
What do you think of this situation and the response of the European countries in which these people aspire?
Vangelism Maimarakis: The crisis with refugees is a time bomb that we have to deal with after winning elections.
The reason for the failure of the SIRIA Government to act as it should have been.
Such matters should be taken forward because, if the problem comes upon you, only emergency measures remain.
And we're in that situation now.
Even the interim government that replaced SIRIS did more in just seven days than Mr. Cipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim Government, which is very much supported by the President of the Republic who called for the EU summit, will help to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note that the refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are victims of the Syrian war, victims of some extraordinary events that occurred with them.
This issue has a profound humanitarian dimension, and we will adhere to the position that European politicians must adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border control and reception centres.
We also need to make effective use of the economic assistance that the EU receives in order to cope with this pressing problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Blessings Maimarakis: Thank you.
In the peace town of Drojkovka Donetsk, a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Kriva Horn (Dnepropetrov region) who had been shot in an automatic vehicle in the evening during the joint use of alcoholic beverages, and a conflict in the village of Verkhnetektek Yasinotawa district of Donechina, had been fired from his machine at his opponent.
A 22-year-old boy was reported from a hospital where he was hospitalized with cross-cutting gunshot wounds.
According to Artem Vasicsky, Deputy Chief of Criminal Investigation of the Police Head of State, during the course of the operational activities, the law enforcement officers have proven to be involved in another serious criminal offence: the killing of a 41-year-old civilian of the same village.
The operators found that, on the same day, a conflict occurred between suspects and a local resident, causing a man to suffer a fatal gunshot wound in the head.
Criminal proceedings under the articles “Investigative murder” and “Investigated serious bodily harm” of the Criminal Code were opened by the Investigation Division of the Dr.
The detainee faces up to 15 years of imprisonment.
Figurant was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility, and reported to the Donetsk Police Service in Donetsk District.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in the colour of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments, Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced by the Russian Court to prison.
Two more residents of the city were sentenced to restrictions on their liberty.
The residents of Novosibirsk were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicted persons received restrictions of liberty for 14 and 18 months.
The Lenin court of Novosibirsk found the four citizens guilty of vandalism against Lenin monuments located on the territory of the CDPF and on Trecottska Street, as well as the memorial complex “Moment of Sves”.
In the latter case, Katyusha rocket and tank T-34 were painted.
Remember, on the night of December 12 in Russia's Novosibirsk, the unknown painted military equipment in the colour of the Ukrainian flag at the Monment of Sves.
The civilian husband of the popular Russian actor Eugion Ciganova Irin Leonov gave birth to a seventh child.
The girl appeared in a Moscow clinic.
The newborn and her mother feel good.
Remember, recently, the Tsigans and Leonov broke up.
Eugene refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions on everyone.
Eugionia Tsiganova 36 years old.
He's an actor in Moscow's "Peot Fomenko" theater.
We know of the films "The Walk," "The Cosmos is a Forebos, "Brest Strength," the series "Ottepel" and "Farza."
On 8 September, Evgeny Tsiganov was recognized as "Acter of the Year" and "A Man of the Year" in the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
A man who opened fire at the University of Delta left an apology note
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Missouri on Monday morning -- and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day -- Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was "smacking" about the first murder and would like to "get it all back" -- the authorized authorities were informed on Tuesday.
The Gothia Police, Missouri, reports that a teacher of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta called for service at 911 hours in about 10 a.m.
On Monday and he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the police to send people to his home.
He said, "Yester night I killed my wife," and also mentioned that there was a "song" in the house, which "no one touches," but is probably upset.
The police asked about the call's name, but he didn't call it.
Lamb did not explain why he opened the shooting.
When the police came to the scene of the crime, they found Amy Prantis' body there, 41, and a note from Lamba, 45, was written, saying, "I'm sorry, I'd like to get everything back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
Writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on the evening of the day he was surrounded by the police.
The Rector of the University, William Laforge, reported that he had no knowledge of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamba obviously had something on his mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb intended a novel between Prantis and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday reported “no information or evidence” of a“love triangle”.
About Prentis was called "good man" Sean O'Stin, who said he had married her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told me he and Prantiss had a daughter who is 19, and she's happy.
He added that Prantis and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Noulse, which San Herald calls a close friend of Prantiss, the last one to work out of the house on the Internet.
Noulse told me that Prantis had a hunting dog on the name of Lighting, and that she had met Lamb for about three years.
Noulse said, "She's always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his relatives at some point on Monday to say, "He won't go to jail."
On the same day that the police stormed him on the "1" road near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot him.
According to a summary posted on the university site, Lamb received a PhD degree in teaching at the University of Delta in the spring 2015.
Stars That Lose Their Hand
Acter (left), in photographs with his son Redmond (right), survived some difficult years.
He fought leukemia in 2001 and lost many years of life in 2009 by Farru Fosette, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reported to have suffered from drug addiction and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this, of course, has played a part.
Luke Shaw left Manchester United for a few months because of a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the League of Champions match where Manchester United lost PSV in Endrichen.
While the defence counsel is experiencing this situation, which prevents him from reaching the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play in that season again.
Trauma took place during the reckless cataract of Hector Moreno at 15th, when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penal zone.
He was helped in the field for nine minutes and gave oxygen before taking him to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double fracture and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or day later and then operated.
It's a terrible thing. A young man came to Manchester at 18 years of age, got through a lot of difficulties and started playing fantastically, and this is where it happened.
It had an oxygen mask in it.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy can't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and he wasn't assigned the Toolbars.
Nicholas Rizzoli's Orbitor didn't punish a Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge when I say it's worth the Toolbars and the red cards.
It was a very bad ride from two legs.
In his Twitterer, Shaw says, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how devastated I am, my way to reconstruction begins, I'll come back stronger than I was."
Also on the theme: Manchest United out of misery with Luke Shaw in a game with PSV
The counsel for the English will have a further incentive to get better to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coke, coach PSV, said, "It's a very heavy trauma."
When any player gets hurt like this, it's all upset.
It was never the intention of our players to hurt the enemy.
Moreno had a leg fractured when he played for Mexico against a Dutch team led by Van Gala on the Mir Cupion Cup 2014.
"It's very hard for him now, because he didn't have any intention to hurt the enemy, and when you hear that this is a very bad trauma, you feel really bad," Coke said.
I couldn't see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball that flew in another direction, so it looked like it had touched him, but I didn't see a pillow underneath Luke.
Talking to SBS6 Moreno, he said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry it.
It's hard for me, and I'm sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after the clash with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lauras?
Every parent takes one thing very soon: if your child likes a book, it'll take a little while before you know it almost by itself.
I guess if you're not David Cameron.
In response to a question raised by a representative of the Sunday children's organization about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose the "Lorax" - an environmentally friendly story written by Dr. Seus in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment on SuperCamps, and he goes on to say, "This is a fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my kids, because it always reveals some kind of image or message we're missing."
Everything would be good, except for the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to translate the contents of the book, but it actually tells the story of a single film film film that was filmed in 2012, with new characters and details added to reflect a rather short original narrative.
"In the high walls of the city of Allmnunville, where there was no green and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of her dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see this tree," we read in the text of a description of the love story, which is unknown to Dr. Seuss (the real name is Theodore Seus Geezel), who died in 1991.
If it looks less suspicious, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of the film "Lorax" on the Internet ModeDatabase site: "In the high walled city of Allmnwall where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart -- a girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being a well-known parent, is so unaware of the contents of a book in which a boy who is not named by name learns about the destruction of the environment of a greedy tree cutter and a prisoner of "the world's" Nadikis despite Lorax's protests (whose name is in the title of the book) - a funny creature with mustams who "speak on behalf of the trees".
Most likely, such a simple PR-task was assigned to an executive who never read the book about Lorax 20 consecutive times.
The representative of Downing Street said that the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments had been made.
Adam Lita obviously had the risk of not getting into England's prefabricated, but it's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if I look at the collection that England has selected for this tour, the repetition of the 3-0 test series that happened last time does not seem to me likely.
I wouldn't rule out winning my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may have been less experienced than the one who was three years ago, but it has one of the reflectors who has a lot of handballs, and collective thinking that will not bring scars from 2012 but only a youth-motivated.
With Moen Ali's ball, it turns into a handball, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for the test level, is an attack.
Another topic: Adam Lett left England for a test shout and was replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Lithuania from me, his chief coach in Yorkshire, is, of course, difficult to analyse.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult circumstances, and the obvious but harsh reality was that the players in the screams were assessed by the judges on the basis of the outcome.
There was no question about John Ruth, for example, what led to this announcement, because (and I said it before) the players are the best ones to choose themselves.
A couple of half a hundred and could expect a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for The Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The chief trainer in England, Trevor Bailis, had a good say in his mood, even when he didn't point to what he was capable and that doesn't surprise me; he's primarily a team player and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the betaman of the test screams leaves his impression -- a difficult question.
Lithuania played seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton played nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play in his own field and in someone else's field.
The only thing you could welcome is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Prime League when Little was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hayles is here, and he's a betaman I appreciate very highly.
He's an unpredictable cricket that we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season, when he earned 236 on his match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
It should at least have the same opportunity as those who were before it, but it will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The thought of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening betsman, which would allow an additional spinner to be introduced, while retaining four speed bowlers, is being considered, and I'm not against that.
I don't see any reason why a beating player can't hit a ball there, and that lion has already shown that he's a damn good chirper.
Moen may not be quite what is needed for his county, Woostershire, but he became the third issue for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old comrade, Justin Langer, played his first 38 "three beta-man" test games before being able to open in 2001.
He won three hundred and didn't look back.
Ansari's castle comes in as a backup spinner, and at my brief contact with him, he proved to me to be a very promising young man.
People can look at his indicative statistics -- on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risk rate, but there's a little of the hypnotists, and those who choose to be young.
He'll learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the prefabricated, England plans to add a couple of practical additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahella Jayawarddin, a Sri Lankan betaman, as a consultant for a test match, could be a workshop.
He's one of the best guys for the game, and he's going to bring into it the wealthier experience gained under all circumstances and in all attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in the game where a white ball is used, and will provide both energy and an indescribable pace in the retina.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in an international scream, whether a game or a training job, and like Mahela, has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if they say what they have already said before, can give new strength to the team.
The Dárem Ben Stokes College is left for a single-day group, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I do not, for example, have problems with that.
While not all agree, the coaches and players choose not to schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easily taken.
British withdrawal camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017.
The unforeseen policy of David Cameron to resume negotiations on the continuation of Britain in the EU every day is increasingly difficult, even without looking back on the election of genius Jeremy "is yes or not?" --Corbin is the leader of the Leborists, or the TC resent of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbina and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained on the day that, in the present situation of the EU, which is facing a wide range of crises, not all of its own manufactures - some of the participating countries have been able to get over the throat of the British self-centric seeding narratives of concessions and undermining agreements of changes that they generally do not want.
Upon meeting in Brighton for an annual meeting, the TCC decided that it did not want them in any case if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call this "Selves Dave and George's Program."
The prime minister and the finance minister ride at summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the background of a prominent local monument, a local famous company, then come home and say that they are recruiting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining British external contacts under the T.E. T. Europeans - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - he suggests that the foreign ministers and officials in some capitals get to an understanding when they don't care, we stay or go.
Angel Merkel, a very cautious chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her office before her situation deteriorates, as she has deteriorated for sitting in her place, Tetcher (11 years), Mitterrana (14) and Colya (16).
The head of France, François Allland, stands before re-elections or replacements in 2017.
He's losing his strength, too.
Poland may soon receive the nationalist government of the right - hand, Spain - left.
It's hard to see them flattering out of their skin to help the villagers whose energy could be spent preventing Scotland from leaving Britain -- something they also don't want because most people have similar separatist trends.
So some of these ministers may even plan to produce deliberately useless SNP straps during the 2017 U.K. referendum campaign to speed up Britain's withdrawal from the EU by my friend.
“Revision was an idea-fix” and “Britana has not received any value from the renewed negotiations”.
Europeans know what a Flit Street could be about to be a predator and how sceptically the media-magnants were built against the EU, unlike Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, which supported our accession in 1973 by the ratio of 2:1.
They may remember Boris Johnson, a founded Euro-portist, famous for his “direct bananas of the EU” in the early 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a sharp company of fearful tax-fearing beggars, telephone hockeys and non-residents, who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had exactly the same opinion about them, but she was aware that when you're in a big gorilla cage, you're going to have to give her bananas to distract her and prevent her from eating you for lunch and having tea again.
In fact, Miliband was a more committed, more than Blair himself, against the Cameron referendum idea, as Blair compromised the EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of that.
But sweet Jeremy Corbin, who friendlyly shook me on his back in Westminster on Monday-- I told him he didn't have time to spend it on me-- it seems like he's risking to repeat Neal Kinnock's 'Drook' strategy of the 80s-- error then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy for working with the press -- not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose Air Force couch he was sitting on Sunday.
The official position of Corbin in Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, the majority of people outside the traditionalist trend of Ukip and a wider range of “little England’s supporters” are likely to say yes.
That's the same thing that Hilary-Benn, but not Bennit-Benn said on the radio and TV this week, and his internal boycott refused to recognize that the appointment of Corbin to the unbearable John MacDonnel "tenth" by the Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father-in-law struggledd to fight on TV for his insolence with his colleagues in the Labour Cabinet, not to enter too far and lose his office in the Cabinet.
Helara’s battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "at all times" -- Ben's phrase -- isn't what McDonnell said, nor was it what J. K. said to the prairies and members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, in general terms.
To inform democracy and your guy Corbin -- remember, he touched even me -- the discipline of messages remains important in a 24-hour-a-day television event for seven days a week, especially in a social network, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is wise not to let Cameron get away from Europe as easily as possible, allowing him to accept the proper support of the Leborists during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbin's main error with regard to EU membership - within the “Bennit” lowland economy - is no longer the question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for whom narcissism, caused by a slight distinction, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his error in the case of Nato, Tom Watson is unfeeling that J.K. will not campaign for an exit, foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on concessions from Britain, when that could be meaningless?
The United States is already deeply disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the government is in a position to cut the costs, as I was reminded of on Monday at lunch in a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Government-funded agency statements that e-smokers were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking were made at a meeting of 12 persons, some of whom were related to the tobacco industry, reported by researchers.
Experts published in British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published an important report -- the reverse milestone last month, calling it the "Comprehensive Review of Evidence."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the association of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in Lancet's medical journal last month, the “extremely furious argument” was criticized on the basis of which the PHA built its main opinion.
In article BMJ, two additional researchers questioned whether these statements had “firm or symphony grounds”.
Martin McCi, Professor of European Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: “Fundamental principle of health - rules must be based on proof of efficiency”.
According to the public, it is expected that PHE statements that “the best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco” are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this emerges from a single meeting of 12 people to develop a multi-critical decision-making model in order to capture their views on the harm caused by different nicotine-producing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McCi and Capewell reported that a sponsor of the meeting was EuroSwis Health, of which the Director General was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT health certificates in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he had reportedly received from Philip Morris, a tobacco company.
No reasonable explanation was given for the selection of Board members, but there were several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also indicated the financing of the industry in publications.
It is not known whether others have experience with tobacco management.
A meeting was also attended by the head of the PHE tobacco service.
A scientific article published by the group “extremely agrees” that there is a lack of “vectory evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria”, wrote McCi and Kipwell.
However, none of these links and limitations were addressed in the PHA report.
McCi and Capvell reported that PHE statements that “there is no evidence at the present time that electronic cigarettes are expensive to bring children or nonsmokers into smoking” are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of the PHE health and well-being service, said that BMJ statements had already been answered.
He said, "electronic cigarettes are far less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two smokers died of his passion for life.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHA has a clear obligation to inform the public about what they prove and what they do not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative risk as compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and NHS costs up to £2 billion a year.
Having clearly indicated that, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only cause part of the harm caused by smoking, we are performing our tasks before the nation.
Former chap. Changel 4 believes that BBC should end Eastenders' series
Former head Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop producing programs such as East Enders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would have paid a lot for successful shows like the Albert Lands soap opera.
Johnson noted that license fees should be used only to create programmes that are not produced by other British television companies.
He criticized BBC for putting a public broadcasting campaign that certainly only a small portion of the audience watch, for the peak airtime, where competitors have high rating shows, and channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said that he would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he had tried without success to cooperate with BBC during his work on Channel 4.
“I can't separate myself from the idea that BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasts that could show competing companies that don't receive subsidies”, told Johnson to the Communications Committee of the House of Lords to clarify the future fate of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I do not consider a good medium- and long-term solution, the company should only be left on the air to those programmes that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice's on the air in Reim Gold because the creators want to get the best possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would show it was ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes have to go to fund transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, East Enders is another; it is generally known that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly have paid a lot for her.
I don't understand how that could be a public broadcast.
I don't think it would be any humiliation to BBC.
A serial businesswoman, Johnson, head of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of having the ratings "because of staff ambitions and their belief that this is the best way to win long-term support."
His comments on the most popular show on BBC are echoed by the comments of the executive director, Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his McTaggart speech in Edinburg in 2003, suggested that BBC sell East Enders.
Johnson noticed that the more field BBCs of a public nature “keep going on to BBC4, where it is often impossible to assess an audience, but at the same time the function of the company has been performed, and this may be presented as an argument in hanja sermons justifying revenue from license fees of £4 billion: yes, of course, we do all these incomprehensible transfers that no one is watching”.
They put them in slots where no one will ever watch them.
With regard to the licence fee Johnson told the Committee: "I appeal to you to find a more regressive system with regard to who gets the most from it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people who for whom 150 pounds are a lot of money, I'm curious, because they don't look too closely and listen to BBC.
Former Sky and Channel Executive Director David Alsten, who also addressed the committee on the last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He noted that only a small fraction of the BBC material is officially classified as educational -- he said that it is 1% of the television content and 0.1% of the radio -- and that the company should support the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the slogan “information, enlightenment and entertainment”.
On the issue of partnership, Alsin noted that BBC should do more in such areas as “Promendative concerts” (only a portion of them appear on TV) and join alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available online.
Sonogentic allows brain cells to be managed by sound waves
You can see in the video how things change the direction of movement when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have removed worms from a genetically modified nervous system that can be managed using sound waves.
The tiny drawbacks change the direction of movement when they are influenced by sound impulses, too high to be heard by the human ear.
Pulse are influenced by the activation of neurons, genetically modified, to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Another theme: The researchers manage brain function by means of light
Scientists say that worms demonstrate the potential for a new technique called “sunogeneity”, which is to use ultrasound to induce certain brain, heart and muscle cells, with a source of ultrasound outdoors.
Srikant Chalasani, a scientist at the Solk Institute, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this technique could one day replace the deep stimulation of the brain, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the brain and used to treat Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes generally do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that bubbles intensified the ultrasound waves, which then enter the worm's body.
Intensified ultrasound waves affect structures called the TRP-4 Zional Channel, found in the membranes of some worms.
Ultrasonic waves force these ion channels to open and initiate the cells that are linked to them, reports the Nature Communications report.
To create the nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to worms, so their motor neurons used the ion channels TRP-4.
During the application of ultrasound to exposure to modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and were injected into worms by activated modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in the “optogenic” - a new direction that allows scientists to switch on and off neurons with light pulses.
Chalassani claims that this technique may have some advantages.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the right part of the brain through the optics, low - frequency ultrasound waves are easily passed through the body’s tissues, so that they do not have to go inside the skull box for delivery.
“We believe that for the treatment of some neurologic diseases in clinical conditions, the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses will, for the time being, make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal,” said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the technique could be applied to muscle and insulating cells.
The forbidden torturer's on your doorstep!
Advertising advertisements ridicule the British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International's protest against the arms exhibit.
Amazing killer drones!
Breaking tidbits of iron candals!
Cluster bombs!
Electrical light and noise oaks, which cause pain, but which do not leave a trail!
There is no doubt that this advertisement, the largest international arms exhibition, is an arid parody prepared by Amnesty International, to draw attention to the British Government's intention to “fight” weapons with repressive regimes, using an ExeL-centre at Doklands to exhibit defence technologies and security systems.
Another theme: DSEI Arms Exhibition: authoritarian regimes travel to London
But a special campaign has also led to the sudden arrival of many passengers on bus stops and on subway trains, who need to look at them again.
"The great announcement that goes through the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by a London subway, depicting the DLR line, which is turned into a tank silette.
In September of this year, a group of arms dealers will play a role in the DLR. Passengers are asked to help prevent the arms from being displayed.
The 300 postmen are painted by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in the Banky "Dismand" Park.
A group, called the Special patrol group, helped spread them throughout London using an ads breaker, a 6-pound set of hotel keys, which is said to be “accessible to about one-third of the advertisement space at the world bus stops”.
London’s transporters are uncomfortable with such “vandalism” in the form of unauthorized postmen.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special patrol team.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the Cruel Designers exhibit and teacher at Essex University, artists are becoming more demanding and seek to bring the political art to an audience outside the gallery.
Many artists are starting to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to enter the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the arms exhibition welcoming passengers in the subway.
The image from Amnesty has been viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and has been created by a pro bono VCCP, with a graphical design and sound artist also working free of charge.
The Cretan Director of VCCP Matt Lever was struck by an advertising silence around an arms exhibit, with a omission on the Excel calendar, and thought, "Let's make them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought it was more realistic and clever to create corporate advertising, but “filling its homes with bright colors and animations has proved more exciting”.
"They have helped us incredibly to draw attention to the sale of illegal test equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take action to ensure that this torturer equipment will not be sold illegally at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of arms exhibition is from within ExcelL, where participants trade fantastically euphical products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed the order for "AT4CS RS shoulder shooting" from the U.S. Army.
It includes “no analogues of cumulative warhead which results in a non-received weaponry operation inside the target”.
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules for Student Residence
It's been 11 years since I moved into the student dormitories as a normal 19-year-old man who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the intense smiles of those I've been angry with -- and the many, long complaints about others.
In general, what I learned can be arranged according to eight simple rules.
The dormitories can range from a slight nerve to a totally frightening one.
He's going to talk: tell people where you came from, whether you're taking academic leave and where you spent it, whether you're Corbin and why you're "fairly loving" or "Marmite," because seriously, guys, it's just a hot-tempered HAHAH, I'll be with you."
Get some rest.
And help others rest, too, by asking questions and putting up with interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you to find the people you like, not the ones you wouldn't even talk to, even if you had a scaffolding, and they would give the extinguishers away.
Let's get people space.
People’s rooms are often turned into a drinking pot, a summer movie hall, and a common shoe, but they are also the place where people dress and feed their underwear.
On the other hand, don't even think about starting university when you're in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room should be a haven, but many dormitories form the culture of the cot from one room to the other, thus promoting friendship, communication and long-term friendly relations.
It could be hell for someone trying to restore power.
There's nothing in culture that lets you say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy I spent on communicating with you."
Try to feel that the student's tired in the conversation, not knocking on him, but sending a text message.
By the way, on the knock: do it.
One of the guys in my home followed this principle: if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with the pizza.
As you start university life at the peak of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, knock on the door to people to introduce themselves to and deliver a plate of chocolate cookies, not so weird, not so much like the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbours, I have something to do, and now smile, and I'm going to ask you personal questions."
Offering house parties is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and you'll probably be able to associate your face with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, that depends on how good you are.
The slurred cats of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend asleep when you knock on them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course someone's chicken's embezzlement is stealing, but is it stealing to take just a little bit of milk for tea?
Get to the milkowner.
Most likely, he'll invite you not to be shy, even if you're in the middle of a rage boiling.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I feel sorry for you, but try to treat that adult better than my neighbor, who poured dishes into her milk to avenge those who took him without asking.
She's in prison now.
You must not make noises that prevent people from sleeping or studying.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're the people who talk about glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to remove the drum and bass gyri because she had 3 a.m. and she had an exam this morning.
In response, the neighbor increased his volume.
When he was finally silent at 5: 00 a.m., she kindly let him sleep for two hours and then dropped his music and locked the door behind him, going to a three - hour test.
Was it not romantic if your future spouse were to live in the same dormitories as you did?
On the contrary, it wouldn't be extraordinary to bite the elbows, and it wouldn't be fair if you had taken a neighbor for your future spouse, pulled him in, ruined his relationship, and had to see him every day, and perhaps be able to watch him stretch his side over to his side with all your good friends?
Of course, you don't have to tell your heart, but if a hot neighbor is definitely not your prospective spouse, try to cool your own dust a little bit.
At that exciting moment, when you realize that someone has left the keys inside his own locked room, the line between the screws and the herbs is as bad as you think.
Good play is fun, but it turns out to be the opposite in a matter of seconds.
Do a valuable and interesting security lesson, hide something, but don't ever hear someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
With a different door and put the keys in a glass of water that you'll then put in the freezer -- but don't stick anybody's things to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on an iPhone when updating from Apple
The new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings, selecting General, and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download it and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error is reported to them that “Renewing the application could not”.
To avoid this, users are encouraged to either wait until recovery is desired or try to update via iTunes.
The phone reports will allow you to complete the entire process.
The process may include the removal of applications for free space - but Apple minimized the probability of this action by reducing the size of the update and also simplified the implementation by means of a special utility that proposes the removal of the applications and re-establish them once the process is complete.
The charger should be satisfied that your phone is loaded or located near the battery to prevent the battery discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop updating because the phone discharge can result in an update.

In iOS 9 new functions, including an improved personal assistant, and innovations that increase iPad productivity, as well as adjustments that increase speed and correct the operating system, are now included.
Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, Moscow ' s military support to President Assad has only led to an increase in the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague, writing PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
That's what PJ Media reports.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad has created the risk of exacerbating and extending the conflict and has a negative impact on our common goal of combating extremism – if we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through the direct transfer of power,” stated the United States Department of State.
They also noted that Kerry had again emphasized the commitment of the United States to the fight against the Islamic State within a coalition of over 60 countries.
He also noted that President Asad would never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State”.
During the past Friday, the White House representatives stated that they did not know exactly what the Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
But the White House Spokesperson, Josh Ernest, noted that the time for a telephone conversation between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, has not yet come: "When the President decides that a phone conversation with President Putin will be in our best interest, then he will raise the phone and try to make this call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase its support for the Assad regime as a “play rate”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake that further support of Assad would only make the situation worse.
“But he didn't listen to my warnings, and as a result, the situation deteriorated," the U.S. President said.
The imported yachts will free themselves from the payment of customs duties.
Mini-economic development intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means of rest and sport from customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of concessionary goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Laškin, informed the report.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitriy Medvedev, following a visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of agencies, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the FSB, the FTS and the Russian authorities, to prepare proposals for an enabling environment for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, the experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yacht.
The owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about €200 million a year go to the executeds of European States for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yacht.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision by the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on amendments to the list of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes, and the granting of full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other recreational and sports smelters.
The Ministry is of the view that this will certainly contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, as Laskina noted.
This issue was brought to the attention of the Subcommission on Customs, Non-tariff Regulation, Protective Measures in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also discussed by the agencies.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic and Social Affairs, the proposed measure for full conditional release on import was essentially a benefit.
Therefore, following the adoption of the protocol, the Subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation will propose to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member States of the EAEC, explaining Laskina.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods required to promote external economic activities and international cooperation, for use in the fields of science, culture, film, sport and tourism, for international assistance and so on, among them, office equipment (staff computers, machinewriters), test instruments, drilling equipment, stage suits and decorations, mobile laboratories and handicrafts, racing vehicles, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious purposes.
In the media service of the Mittrans, the Izvestiums reported that they had drafted mandatory regulations on the seaports of Kerchi, Sevastoppol, Yalta, Feodosia and Epatheria, which provide for simplified arrangements for the establishment and entry of small-scale, sports sailing and pleasure crafts into the seaport.
By means of a minitransmittance, the captains of the Crimea seaports are instructed to ensure that a simplified procedure is applied to small-scale, sports sailing and pleasure craft at the seaport and the de-ship of listed vessels from the seaport.
The Ministry of the Interior has also prepared draft regulations for the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the waters of Crimea seaports.
In the case of Yalta and Feodosia, orders have already been issued, and others are in the process of being harmonized, as noted in the press service of the agencies.
In the opinion of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Republic of Crimees and Sevastopol must register in respect of small vessels for non-profit purposes.
The problem is that it's because of poor infrastructure in Russia that's extremely difficult with yachting.
If you look at southern Italy and France, there is a growing industry that involves a large number of people.
In Russia, in fact, everything is on the spot.
Our shores are of little interest, the only piece, where the yachts can be exploited year after year, the Black Sea in Sochi, Helenjik, Novoroposisisk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that there are extremely strict rules of the border service: in order for the boat to walk, a mass of permits to be made available.
Also, within Russia, yacht will not even be able to heal anywhere.
And for two days she can go with her fuel, and then there's a problem where she can take it, and says the director of the sales company, Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As for the yacht storage sites, there are now special yacht sheds in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and the yachts are being deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are wealthy people, but the demand for yacht has decreased as the crisis began.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
An international press service reported on this.
“New funding will support a number of priority reform measures in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, the communication states.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Qemiao Fan, stated that the reform of the banking sector would help restore credit in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that the World Bank had witnessed the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
The Polish Government has previously approved the loan in Ukraine’s €100 million, passing over the "Novosta REA".
In prisons, separate units are requested to be set up for transgeners.
At the Public Council of the Federal Prison Service (FSIN) in October 2015, among other matters, the possibility of separate blocs for transgenders and transvestites will be discussed.
This was told by Councillor Vladislav Grib.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-sex convicted persons in Russia, it is possible to provide for separate cells, blocks or even (if such criminals are many) in domestic prisons in the long run to establish a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that it is only after the convicted have received appropriate medical examinations to prove that the offender is indeed a human being identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex that can be punished.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgeners from other prisoners will ensure the safety of departing prisoners.
The proposed practice, he said, worked well abroad: there were separate chambers for transgenders and special units in the correctional institutions, which were held before a court decision.
Today, it's the only way to work with such criminals.
They must definitely be isolated, as the presence of transvestites and transgeners in conventional cells is dangerous to them, it is the suffering of their families and the sea of problems for FSIN employees.
The humiliation of the trans by the cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large a city, how many criminals with an uncertain gender, you have to count on where to distribute them.
Individuals are definitely not needed, just cells, blocks in prisons.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgeners.
As the Grib explained, there may be 50 or 100 people in the unit, and if the specialized body is created alone in Russia, transsexual prisoners will be able to do so from any region.
Citizens are detained at the scene of the crime, so the transfer of transvestites or transgeners from other actors during the investigation and trial is not realistic, but the introduction of such practices for those already convicted in a separate colony is considered by the Grib.
Remember, on the eve of the day, law enforcement officials were unable to determine which detention facility, male or female, to identify a 24-year-old transsexual Domitri Koukova (known as Aline Davis), which prevented a male and female student from being arrested.
He was released home under a non-removal subscription.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and in the media, as there is not as yet a mechanism to keep transgeners in SISM and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT Movement activist (LGBT - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual) Nikolai Alexev supported the idea of creating special places to serve sentences by transgeners, noting that it is also possible to define people abroad - male or female - according to their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, just as there's security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alexev.
Prisons must be safe, so that separate blocs could be done both in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially as they are more in prisons than trans-geners.
Alexeiev, however, doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to hand over themselves for trans-exactuals to get to a different place from the ordinary colony.
Of course, medical examinations can be introduced before placing people in colonies for trans-geners, but not always things happen.
For example, in the United States, one of the inmates of Chelsea Menning looked like a man, and in prison he said he wanted to change the floor, said Alexev.
A man can feel anything.
But so far there are no certain places to serve sentences for transgeners, and I doubt that prison officers will be able to think seriously about the safety of such people and be sensitive to their orientation or sexual identity.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lourdipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders into the colony could seriously delay the start of serving sentences for convicted persons.
A commission is a question of sexology, and psychiatrists have long surveillance, and it's not one test on which high-quality detention is based.
Psychiatry is what makes it possible today.
So, before changing, potential patients are always doing these tests -- they're really showing whether or not a sex shift is a surgical intervention, the right measure, says Lorkipanidze.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how this system can be applied to convicted persons, since it takes a month on average.
The doctor, although generally supported by separate units for transsexuals, is also doubtful that under the current economic conditions it will be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new facilities, medical assessments, to transgeners in Russia.
There is no official statistics, but given that there are about 5% homosexuals in Russia, there are still fewer transgeners, and those who have this bias and who commit crimes are just a small number, said Loklypande.
Right now, at the request of the administration of the colony of homosexuals, transgenders are able to obtain separate conditions of detention.
Michael Antipov won the world’s junior championship on chess.
In Hunty Mensysk, the world championship for chess was over 20 years of age.
The line of birth seemed more than intriguing.
The winner was only in the last round, and he became a Russianman, Michael Antipov, who was able to catch up with the fear of Jan-Kishostoph Doudu, who seemed to be going to the title.
The girls were awarded victory by the Ukrainian chess player Natalie Bucks.
The chess champion, who had been in Hunty-Mansyski since early September, seemed to have lost almost all of the intrigue to the middle of the tournament, since the Polish representative Jan-Kishostof Douda, who had given a series of four victorys (which were held in the Swiss system of 13 tours), had taken the lead.
Given that Douda was the first grade rating, and was generally considered to be one of the most promising young chessists, the likelihood that he would miss out was very small.
And even when Douda lost his speed and allowed Mikhail Antsov, a Russianman, to reduce the backlog to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious asset in the title struggle.
After all, Antoffov had to win the 13th tour to catch up with his leader.
But even that wouldn't help, you win your party.
Plus, this obligation of victory, of course, could have affected the game of the Russian chess player and led to irrevocable mistakes.
Happily, Michael Antipah was able to avoid them.
He made a good deal with Francesco Rambadi, after which he had to wait for his party to finish Douda's meeting with Benjamin Bocom.
Fortunately for Antipas, a Polish chess player brought up a battle with a Dutch poet.
So, Antipov and Doud had 10 of the 13 possible points, but Antipov had the best additionals.
It is therefore his leadership of Hunty-Mansian Autonomous District, of which the Governor of Natalia Komárov has traditionally given high priority to the development of chess in the region, and has given the main prize.
And the girls' competitions didn't have an intriguing ending.
The leader of the tournament - Natalare Buxe (Ukraine) - was not enough to lose in the last round to win the title, which she did successfully.
So the victory of the Russians, Alina Bivol, prevented her from catching up with Bux.
The Russian athlete stayed second with the championship at 0.5 points.
It changes the regional structure.
The company brings the Privolj and Ural regions together in one concentrated Volzhsko-Hural region, Siberia and the Far East, in the East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
According to Michael Slobdin, the Vimpelcom gender director, changes are being made to “remain a powerful market player”, to develop a company called `new, not always favourable external conditions'.
In a television interview on Russia 24, Mr. Slobdina clarified that they intended to reduce staff "ten per cent" in Russia.
The exploratory examined 78 Moscow bites by Burger King and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, a restaurant in the Volkola highway was fined 50,000 roubles, and a 90-day establishment in the Big Toul Street was closed, but resumed work after all the violations had been resolved.
A total of 43 inmates violated the requirements of the facilities.
Among other violations, poor sanitation and sanitation facilities, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, were found in some institutions by bacteria of the E. coli group.

Igor Artemiev, Head of FAS, stated that the department opposed the indexing of 10 per cent of freight and the granting of public services, as requested by the RHD OA.
They wanted 17% of the indexing first, now they want 10%, and also billions of subsidies from the budget, he says.
We're saying that it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up the expensive pets, the football teams, your own TV teams, stop spending your left and right.
He added that the FAS had its “pretentious” proposals, which are currently under discussion in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net calculation from Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of a full-breed supply of $300 million, reported to the gold mining company.
In this case, Politell will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the distribution of shares in the interest of Sumeru and market rollings) that can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has the time until 3 October to implement the option or to request payment.
The details of the Polimatal negotiations do not open.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of the “Kysil” Politel project in Kazakhstan.

Minimorg: Target food aid will not be the equivalent of a card in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evatukh, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be the equivalent of the food distribution card system in the USSR.
These include modern targeted food aid to the population and support to an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to try the word "food card."
In particular, I would like to point out that the proposed product maps should not be confused with the resulting total deficit, the distribution system, in which the number of products produced is adjusted.
So far, we have proposed a concept, if approved, we'll propose a legislative change," and the TTSS says Mr. Eutukhov.
I used to say that the food card programme for the poor had been put in the government.
See Igor Schwala for details on the MinDromorga initiative in "Award", "Igor Schwala has commissioned the production of food cards".

This year's study of the Top 1,000 Russian managers' Association of Russian Managers comes out at the 16th time.
As a tool to assess the professional reputation of Russian senior management, the study takes stock of the results of the work of Russian managers during the year by identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the rating winners of last year.
The winners of the previous year are requested to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year's rating and to nominate their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list is nominated for up to 10 new managers from other companies that would be appropriate for inclusion in the general pool of candidates.
It is possible to propose the following company managers: Financial Director, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, Director of Personnel, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Authorities, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert-proposed manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to present his management team and up to 10 new managers from other companies.
The movement of candidates on a sectoral basis is based on the Association of Managers ' industry classification: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and timber industries, engineering, media, steel, multiple holdings, professional services, telecommunications, services and consumer goods production, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a log and a password for the entry to www.top1,000.amr.ru, where they are aware of the remaining participants and are able to present their assessments on the criteria proposed for each functional channel.
The rating methodology is based on the principle of “Best choose the best”: top managers evaluate top managers, and functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle gives the greatest degree of authenticity to the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final ratings are approved at meetings of the expert commissions.
All candidates for the current year ' s rating and multiple candidates for the previous year ' s ratings are invited to attend the regular meetings of the expert commissions.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for approval of a list of top managers and eight commissions for approval of the heads of functions.
The expert commissions are invited to approve the lists in alphabetical order (places that remain strictly in line with the online assessment and are closed prior to the publication of the ratings) or to make adjustments to them in accordance with the attached list of stand-by candidates.
The names of companies have been given in accordance with the Russian language rules and the rules of “supplier”.
At the time of publication, the ratings could change the status of managers and companies.
The investment rate is 10-13 per cent.
Experts estimate that the small- and medium-sized business credit market in January-April of the current year lived 40 per cent.
What do you think is the situation today?
Following the panic attacks of the end of 2014 and early 2015, the amount of credit to ISB declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
No one benefited from the 25-30 per cent loan.
If the bank had previously been able to place all of its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-removals, it was impossible to do so now: the rates are already blocked.
For business, the current rate of credit rates for ISBs is not comfortable.
For much of the investment projects, the current level is not acceptable in terms of their return.
A 10-13 per cent rate would allow the business to invest in a wide range of projects and to generate attractive returns.
How much do you estimate the credit demand of entrepreneurs is met?
The situation has improved slightly following the downgrading of the CB.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients are less likely to apply for loans.
First of all, business doesn't understand the prospects for its own development and future incomes.
Business today has one solution: it is necessary to learn to work according to today ' s economic situation in the country and the region.
There is a need for closer monitoring of current results, monitoring of cash flow.
At the same time, with the availability of financial resources, it is important to use new technologies to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this, in the end, allows companies to make products more competitive and preserve business even in a volatile economic situation.
What are the major trends of the credit market that will be consolidated and will affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will interest change?
The forecast of a lower average rate would largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and the regulator was now showing consistency on the reduction of the key rate.
However, the radical drop in credit prices for IMS is not worth waiting.
In the current situation, the problem is primarily inflation, which makes a higher interest rate necessary to generate real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even at the decline in the CB rates.
As to the level of delay, small- and medium-sized businesses, traditionally limited both in their capacity to supplement money and in economic behaviour correction options, will undoubtedly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a substantial reduction in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's what Masada says with Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautiful, concise, and at the same time hard enough for those who are accustomed to a cyrillian or Latin.
So a new CX-5 Corsover, as well as any other brand model, is technically topped inside without a sense.
Japan is already able by virtue of its Japan-Science to prove its attachment to the products of the rising sun to the state of total admiration.
You can do as many arguments as you can in other countries for cars, and the person will agree with these arguments in principle, but all the conversation will depart from the final phrase, "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about.
Such people must probably love not only technology but all other Japanese things.
Citing Basa, passing the Vasab food, collecting cans and putting on your girlfriend -- no, not in the kimono, of course, but in the Japanese street fashion: soap, creativity and very unexpected.
Perhaps the Japanese school form is the only form that girls enjoy after school.
It has amazing properties: both senses and strict.
And the older the girl, the biter soup.
The main change in appearance CX-5 is the radar grid with five horizontal lines.
But where the car's face changes a new pattern of lights and rear lights, where the car learns about in the traffic of the cars.
As in the past, Mazda CX-5 is very tempting.
Siluthe is harmonious, but its appearance is very strict.
You don't have to call the police.
The CX-5 drive, one of the safest in the world, is only one of the stoic Japanese peace.
A diesel engine with a volume of 2.2 litres provides a high torque at a wide range of speeds.
The fuel consumption of this engine, at 175 lL, is only 5.9 L. The power unit shall be equipped with an automatic transmission and a complete transmission.
Black boots, black cloak, black bag...
To add a little black humor in this image, you can choose the Legins with a pinnacle from the No Cross police tape.
On the other hand, in Mazda, you did your utmost to keep the CX-5 driver out of the scene of your own accident.
In order to increase comfort, while maintaining good management, the suspensions reworked the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the front-end limits.
The full transmission system has been adapted to Russian conditions.
The level of noise from road and high speed engine is reduced by 13 per cent.
A traveling merchant in a flower or a strip is as boring as a budgetary sedan.
It's different if a girl scoops in a bathtub with an original figure.
I mean, from a computer game in a role-playing genre.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
New CX-5 has improved construction of both front and rear seats, providing optimal storage of space for both broad shoulders and for long legs, who has what they possess.
Longer estimates are that the stress in the front of the central tunnel is now soft and do not hit the ankles in print.
The largest set of active security systems at Mazda is proposed at CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to recognize potential threats.
There are adaptive lightings here, warning of a step off the lane, monitoring dead areas, and safe braking.
Marza CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
A convenient minimum performance, it contains a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are composed of a ratio of 4:2:4 and each compartment is equipped with a separate lifting lever and increases the baggage compartment to 1,560 litres.

Kiev broke the atomic power.
Kiev officially declared Ukraine ' s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the construction of Hmelnicka nuclear power plant.
The Supreme Council voted on Wednesday, after second attempt, to terminate the Moscow agreement.
The arrangements for the construction of the third and fourth clusters were signed in 2010-2012, but could not be started.
On Wednesday, the Verkheln Council of Ukraine adopted a law that terminates the agreement with the Russian Federation in 2010-2012 on the construction of the third and fourth cluster on Hemelnica nuclear power plants.
Only a second vote was successful in introducing the bill, for the first time supported by 210 deputies at the required minimum of 226, but 234 members of Parliament voted in favour of the draft.
The initial project of the Hmelnika nuclear power plant in the USSR was to have four power units for 1 GW with a VER-type reactor, but only two were successful in building.
Negotiations with Moscow on further development led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and the Council adopted the relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since no funds were available in Ukraine's budget, it was anticipated that blocks would have to be built on loans from the Russian side, but no funds had been allocated.
Following the coup d'état in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in two Kiev countries, the Moscow nuclear industry began to delineate its relations with Moscow by refusing to cooperate on the Hemelnician nuclear power plant and the Ukrainian nuclear fuel plant project.
The only area in which relations remained remained in the Russian Federation for fuel for existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (securing about half of the country's electricity generation), as while Ukrainian NEC Energoatt replaced Russian supplies with nothing.
Plans for the construction of Hmelnica AEA with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been finally refused: as early as 2014, in Kiev, negotiations with Czech Skoda JS were being announced.
UN Gencé against the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, reported during a press conference that there was no military solution to the situation in Syria.
“No military solution”, gives AP his answer to a question about Russian military support for Syria.
Mr. Ki-moon also announced that he would hold a meeting with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the permanent member countries of the United Nations system later this month.
"The meeting will be over Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Russian Deputy Chief Genschaba, Nikolai Bogdanowski, reported that Genstab did not preclude the establishment of an Air Force base in Syria in the future.
So far, there's no such plan.
'Not at all possible,' said Mr. Bogdansky.
Previously, the U.S. reported that they did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who claimed that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist faction prohibited in the Russian Federation by the Islamic State.
For more details about the United States' doubts about Russian aid to Syria, read the "Dear", "The Russian Military Presence in Syria's Concerns Washington".
In the PA, OSCE reports on a possible meeting between the parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of OSCE, Arthur Guerrasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian colleagues of parliament to discuss the situation in south-eastern Ukraine.
“What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations”, cites the words of Mr. Gerassim, TTSS.
He also called for the implementation of the mine agreements and “to return to the normal functioning of our countries”.
He asked whether, in his view, dialogue between Ukraine and Russia was currently possible at a parliamentary level - in “Normanda” format or in a contact group at the OSCE PA site - Mr. Herasimov noted that the dialogue had been held, that there were Mining Agreements.
At the same time, a policy has been said to support all types of dialogue in Kiev.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, President Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Dones and the Luga Republic had not changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given their mandates.
Yesterday, the Lower Novgorod electoral commission summarized the outcome of the municipal dunum elections by delegating the 12 deputies ' mandates on the party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral irregularities were made by CPRF representatives who had been accused by a sample of “falsifications”.
The opposition ' s comments were not adopted.
At the same time, the Communists of Russia refused to organize a referendum on the elimination of the fee for the capping of multi-family buildings.
The city sample officially presented the results of the elections in the proud Lower Novgorod of the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1.03 million people have been included in the voter lists in Lower Novgorod, 746.7 thousand have been distributed to the station board and 268,000 have voted in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots have been declared invalid, while 24 have been lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were allocated to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
Six members of the parliament in the bitter are assigned to Demetrius Svatkowski, Demetry of Krasnov, Vassili Schupranova, Elizabeth Solonenko, Vestislav Rusterjav and Igor of Hill.
The only mandate of LDPR was for Vladimir Zhirinski, leader of the party.
The two mandates of the CPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and the President of the State Destiny, Alexander Tarayawim.
The three mandates of "Just Russian Russia" are to Alexander Rasúlski, Igor Bogdanwu and Michael Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates are to determine whether they will serve as deputies in the cityhouse: in the case of a waiver of the mandate, he moves to the next batch candidate.
The Chairman, Alexander Macbeeev, in his own language, informed the commissioners that he introduced duty stations for a “telephone of Zhirinski and others” to avoid mandates.
At the time of approval of the electoral protocol, the representatives of CRCF have stated multiple violations.
A member of a mining group with a consultative vote from CPRF, Leonid Krasnokutsky, proposed not to recognize the vote at four districts No. 21-24, recalling that the head of the Sormov district administration had closed the entrance to the administration building, which had four district commissions.
In the early hours, neither the Gus Odma deputies nor the candidates, nor the observers themselves could pass, and the radiologne scandal on the doors of the administration was shown at the telephyra.
In District Commission meetings, all observers and members of the Commission, with the right of consultation, were able to attend.
They had no access to the head only when the ballot had ended and the district commissions had not yet arrived to hand over their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was amended and the interested persons could be present at all the meetings," steamed out a member of the Allied Mountains of Natalia Andrewsin.
The Communists objected that, in the blocked administrative building, more than four hours had been illegally held by the town councillor Ludmila Artistov, on which a statement had been sent to the investigating committee.
The opposition was also outraged that, on election day in a number of UICs, the openings began to be reprinted at 6-7 a.m., putting in them ballot papers for early ballots.
At the same time, no members of the Commission, with the right of consultation and observers, were alerting them, so that they had already begun the 8 a.m. elections.
The Communists are confident that during the morning before the opening of the ballots, ballots could be dropped uncontrollably.
However, the mountains, which had already dealt with more than 124 complaints on various grounds, said Alexander Maceev, did not find any violations with the injections of untrained ballots.
Members of the Commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from “Justy Russia” Maria Popper to proceed through the week with the amendment of regional legislation in order to clearly determine the opening time of the envelopes with the ballot papers, which would then fall into the urn.
"In order of your own initiative, go to the CIC," said Mrs. Popus Alexander Maceev.
At the end of the meeting, the Chairman was sorely accused by a member of CRCF that he shouted that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered falsifications in the elections by the electorate.
"You're not here at the rally, be careful to state!" "The chairman of the electorate was offended.
As a result, the protocol was almost unanimously adopted.
By 27 September, the electorate had to approve the general results of the election, which would then be the first meeting of the Sixth Grand City of Lower Novgorod for three weeks.
In addition to defining the outcome of the elections, the city electoral commission denied the Russian Communists political party the registration of the initiative group for a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were about to bring two questions to the discussion of the sub-urbans: whether they agreed that the hats for the renovation of multi-family buildings should be “immediately abolished” and the housing and communal services should be “free before 2020”.
However, the lawyer for the Irina Masova duum explained that the application of the somunists of Russia was contrary to the law.
The FedEx revenue is mixed, declines in projections by 2016.
FedEx reported the disappointing results of the last quarter, and a giant delivery service forecast reduced annual profits owing to a decline in the demand for freight and increased costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it planned to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time, FedEx reported last year that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Her shares cost about 2.5 per cent of the pre-arms held 45 minutes before the exchange was opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that it planned to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends in the following May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
The analysts estimated $10.804 in FactSet review.
The forecast declines despite an average increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and increased charges for ground transportation of heavy or large cargoes, starting in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase revenues over the past year by reducing expenditures, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company “has worked stablely in terms of weak compared with the forecast of economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
Plans for the recruitment of labour on holidays were announced the day after the tender, UPS, that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about as much as they were hired last year.
For the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The return on the stock was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per share of the Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected in recent years by the recession in the urgent international transport sector, resulting in a lack of growth in gross income in its air-to-air unit.
However, the Internet buying boom has dramatically improved the results of FedEx Ground.
The last quarter of the revenue from land transport increased by 29 per cent, but operating incomes remained largely unchanged owing to the increased cost of large departures and self-insured services.
The FIU unit had higher incomes due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector income had fallen due to higher pay costs.
In the preliminary tenders, about an hour before the FedEx stock exchange fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed the Tuesday, fell 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
At the most welcome meeting in a few years, the Federal Reserve System leaders will spend two days this week at the 27-foot table of the Gonduras red tree, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At one end, the United States walled room for two floors high will hang on top of it.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the country ahead of all others.
The Central Bank received double orders from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and retain stable prices.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third, unwritten commission: financial stability.
And this third assignment may be an unknown factor in the almost predictable decision that will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to give away the unprecedented incentive given by almost zero short-term interest rates from the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show a positive growth in the economy, recent shocks in the world's financial markets can also keep the already cautious leaders of the Federal System from adding valor by raising the basic rate for federal funds - only one quarter of the percentage point.
“It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration”, said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"One thing I think is that if they were looking for a reason not to raise a stake that's increased uncertainty about the world market enough to give them an excuse to wait on," she remarked.
There was no consensus on what the Federal Reserve would do in the Federal Reserve system, which in itself had generated fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, are expected to hold the Federal System back from doing so, with a key indicator showing only about a 30 per cent chance of rapid recovery.
This could lead to a fall in the equity market if the Federal System raised the rate, provided that decision-makers did not reduce the impact on the promise that the next increase would be slow.
On Tuesday, the Dow-Johns index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was triggered by expectations that those who set the strategy of the Federal System will leave the rate this week,” said John Longski, chief economist of the Goody's Capital Markets Research.
"It'll be a surprise if the Federal System raises the stakes at this point in time," he noticed.
If the management of the Federal Reserve System is so successful, “they will have to go a long way towards adopting their strategy so as to keep the financial markets in hand so that they don't panic”.
Other experts objected that an increase in the rate would calm the financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty as to how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seems to have been inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first little closet in a slow financial tighten, which could have confirmed the strength of US reconstruction.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she was awaiting an increase this year, despite Liberian complaints that greater economic progress was needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment declined to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest in more than seven years, and almost at the level considered to be full employment in the Federal System.
The increase in wages shows signs of an acceleration.
And while inflation still falls below the 2 per cent annual target set by the central bank, the federal system’s management stated that the temporary effect of the sharp drop in oil prices was a key factor.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the decline in the labour market," observed Ian Schaferdson, chief economist of the Pancheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China had dwindled its currency.
The Doo-Johns average index for industrial stock fell by 16 per cent relatively high in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could hinder global growth.
The market has partially restored its positions this month, and the Doo-Johns index is now about 10% lower than the high Mayan value.
For the administration of the Federal Reserve System, market resentment adds to the complexity of the calculation of the time frame for the increase in interest rates.
“In the absence of information on what has happened in the financial markets and on the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, they would have engaged the nuteons at that meeting,” stated Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Researcher of UKLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former officer of the Federal Reserve System.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what might be the consequences for the American economy, and they have little or no reliable data since the recent events in China," said Oliver.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal system and should not be taken into account technically when making those decisions.
But in fact, the Federal Reserve has become the world's financial power.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
It's just a hint from the then president of Ben S. Bernanke that in 2013 the Federal Reserve system could “reduce” its monetary expansion, shock markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems were increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve System would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other Headquarters banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “swift of art than science”, noted Zakary Carabel, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Geoffrey Laker, President of Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, Virginia, said this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there have been cases of excessive reactions to the financial market movements that do not seem to be linked to economic principles”.
Lucker, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on increasing the rate, as an example, cited the 1998-99 decisions.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Federal System to reduce its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three meetings, “whether or not the limited identifiable effect on growth in the United States”, said Laker.
A year later, federal leaders reversed these declines.
The federal reserve system should be placed first only in times of major crises, such as market failures in 2008,” said Adam S. Popen, former member of the interest committee in Bank of England.
The last panic and not close to this level, he said.
“You would certainly not want to be in a situation where you are afraid of the growth of rates because the markets are in shock,” said Pozene, President of the Peterson World Economics Institute.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that has changed, I do not think they should go ahead.

Singer General Sergei Narishkin admits that the United States deliberately destabilizes the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of the refugees reach Europe.
According to Interfax, he presented this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar in the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I'm not an advocate of the spiritological theories, but the question is, is it not Europe's ultimate goal for those who have, with such manic persistence in recent years, destabilized the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?" he asked.
“It was certain that someone had assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people, who are fleeing from death, would reach the successful EU countries”, he added.
He asked: “Many European political leaders have made a frank statement about the causes of this crisis, the wave of refugees that literally ensnares their countries ”?
"No, old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to be silent," he noted.
In the opinion of Narishkin, NATO has violated many European values and norms of international law.
“Europeans have, unfortunately, long and impartially looked at and looked at how the NATO-mandated military assailant has been trampling on the moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” emphasized the Speaker.
Insurgents, mostly Islamists, are opposed to government forces and loyal militias.
The terrorist group “Islamic State” in Russia later joined the opposition of the Syrian Government.
The US supports both Asada and IG rebels.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria described the reason for the West’s hostility to Russia.
The West ' s claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact those of sovereign States.
That was the opinion of Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, 'Rossy 24', NTV, 'Russia Today, TTSS, 'Interfaxu' and 'Rossian Gazette'.
Asaad said that the West does not perceive partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and put another in his place to act in the interests of Western countries rather than in the interests of his homeland.
Assad drew attention to the sharp break-up of Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
He said that for them, President Vladimir Putin of Russia “turned from the friend of the West into an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power in a non-democratic manner, despite his election as a result of the democratic elections in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Asada to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the repeated statements of the West that Asad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people through the elections and, if he did, at the request of the people, not by a decision of the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president remains, or else he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Asad named Russia and Iran as friendly countries and recalled that they were cooperating with.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Referring to Iran ' s military support, the Syrian leader noted that it supported the Syrian State in politics, economics and the military.
He denied the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is providing us with military equipment.
“Of course there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but the exchange has always taken place”, he explained.
As for the other States, we are open to cooperation with either State, with a strong desire to fight terrorism.
“We don't see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Gygilian coalition, known by the United States,” Asad said.
The death toll exceeded 230,000; the number of refugees reached 11.5 million.
A part of the Territory was captured by the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in Russia.

One of them, a van where the family was located, stopped in a dangerous area near the water, and the stream suddenly reached it.
The youngest of the victims was four years old.
All the victims are residents of Colorado City and Hildale areas, who were hit by natural disasters.
Three children were also reported to have been rescued.
There are 650 teams involved in search and rescue.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Policy: Peace: Lanta.ru
U.S. Secretary John Kerry made a telephone call with the Foreign Minister of Russia, Sergei Lavrov.
Reuters reports this with reference to the representative of State Department John Kirby.
It is noted that the conversation was the subject of a conflict in Syria.
Kirby did not, however, provide additional details.
At the same time, he said that the United States had tools for “the further isolation of Russia” if it supported the President Bashar Assad of Syria, passing over the RRA News.
As reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lavrov, during a conversation with Kerry, reiterated the need for a unified front to combat terrorist groups operating in that country.
Ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.
Some bilateral issues were also raised.
United States officials had previously stated that Russia was building up its military presence in Syria and had expressed concern about the increase in Moscow ' s support of Assad.
In Washington, D.C., Russia stated that if Russia continued to support Asada, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the Russian press secretary, Demetrius Peskov, said that the country would not be excluded from international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of overthrowing the Assad regime.
A terrorist organization, the Islamic State, seized part of the Territory.

Borodai called the American newspaper slander on Strallkov.
The former government president of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, refuted the information that was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said that in a telephone interview with Lents.ru correspondent.
The note at Washington Post is beautiful because it's all clean overboard.
A former Defence Minister, Igor Strelkov, of course, did not connect or “get out” him from the Donbasa Republic in a very positive mood, without ropes, without the three ferries of money that are attributed to him by different characters,” he noted.
According to Borodaya, it was about Stralkov talking to a reporter in the United States newspaper that was really going on.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said a former head of the Government of the DWP.
Borodai emphasized that he did not know why the correspondent of the American publication decided to write that Strallkov had been taken to Russian territory as “linked”.
I suspect it's an provocation.
If it's not provocation, it's an amazing misreading of words, because I've stressed that Strallkov left himself," Borodai noticed.
"It's a slander, it's on me, it's on Strallkov," he concluded.
Earlier, an article on the Washington Post contained the words of Borodya that he had taken Strallkov out into Russian territory by force.
According to the report, Borodai indicated that he had to bind his associate.
The Polish authorities began looking for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
Polish loggers began cutting the trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some, a train carrying the gold of the Third Reich is located.
Work began on Tuesday, 15 September, reports Reuters.
According to military experts, the clearance of forests is necessary to verify the reliability of rumours on railways with treasure.
Arms and precious minerals may be located inside the train.
On 31 August, the governor of the Polish Perezilian Warship, Thomas Smallrsch (Tomaz Smarz), suggested that new evidence of the existence of a train with gold was not more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon the search area.
Three days earlier, the Polish Vice-Minister of Culture, Peter Zhoukhowski, stated that local cemeteryers found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich referred to in legends with “pretentially 99 per cent”.
Zhukhowski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the jewelry were found, they would become the property of the State treasury, and the treasure would not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two of the law firm ' s clients contacted the Polish town of Valbzhi, informing the authorities that they had found a train in a sealed tonle at a depth of 70 metres.
The main drug market in the Russian Federation has proposed a ban on the sale of tobacco to persons up to the age of 21.
Russia’s leading drug problem proposed prohibiting tobacco sales by the age of 21.
Evgeny Brune noted that until that age, “any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly harmful”.
So he said in a live radio station, Guuririt Moscow, commenting on the fact that Speaker Sovfed Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21.
Man’s maturity is uneven.
You can serve in the army from 18 years of age and be physically ready.
Psychologically, he has been ready for a full life in society since the age of 21.
"It's known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is only finally ripening by the age of 21," Brunn said.
Earlier, Sultan Hamzaev, a member of the Public Chamber and Project Manager, Sultan Hamzaev, informed the Izves, that Matvienko supported an initiative to raise the age price of selling alcohol and “agreed jointly with the Public Chamber to raise the issue again at the site of the upper House of Parliament”.
According to the activist, a working group will soon be set up in the Federation Council to draft a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to verify compliance with the law on child protection
The resident of Novosibirsk asked the Regional Prosecutor's Office to check the Bible into compliance with the federal law on “Protection of Children from Information Affecting Their Health and Development”, issued on 16 September by the correspondent Sib.f.
The author stated that on 26 August 2015, he obtained a Bible from the Chinese City store in the Red Avenue, which was published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he discovered fragments that he believed were violating the FOO on protecting children from information that was harmful to their health and development.
On 16 September, the application was accepted by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office in Novosibirsk.
The resident Novosibirsk will respond within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
More interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, comments the complainant to Sib.f. correspondent.
Besides, it's a very fundamental problem that's going to upset society.
It will start reading the Bible, which it had not done before.
The Brazilian Union of Pediatrics of Rio Grandy promotes healthy breast-feeding food
The Brazilian Pediatric Organization of SPRS has developed a scandalous method by which it intends to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breastfeeding: the method implies the display of images of babies associated with their breasts written with harmful food.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, of which children receive all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
Because of the high energy needs of pregnant and newborn women, it is recommended that daily calories increase by about 500 calories per day.
However, recent studies have shown that one increase in calories is not the only change in the diet that mothers should do.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor of the Beylor Medical College in Texas, found that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the expressity of the genes of children and prevents their growth of tumors.
Unfortunately, a negative impact on the child ' s immune system has been found.
A school bus was hit by a train under Hamburg.
In the vicinity of Hamburg, the train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the railway road.
A 23-year-old woman driving, realizing that she could not move away from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a clash in their eyes.
He was taken on video by one of the students.
The emergency created panic among the disciples.
Some children started to cry and run along the side of the road.
The march is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously injured except one passenger of a train who was slightly injured.
The damage to the accident was estimated at Euro300,000.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) leadership called for the prohibition of boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown, Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in combination with a Filipino, Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles of the International boxing Federation (IBF) in weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with Magali knockout in round 12.
Brown, on the other hand, went to a hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was connected to the life support system.
At the Brown trade, 22 won, only two were defeated, and one battle ended at night.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second case of a flight of Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died from trauma at the ring.
It is now recommended that AMA not engage in this sport, but rather prohibit it in its view.
I understand that this is happening unintentionably, said Stephen Pernis, Vice President of the organization.
But in the way that there is a boxing box now, there will always be situations where the athlete receives the brain’s hemorrhage or trauma, leading either to death or to serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional entity that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against the RF parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Committee of the Russian Federation, Sergey Narishkin, described the unacceptable imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said so by addressing the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We view this as unacceptable action as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And that must not be repeated, because it is a demonstration of political shame and a disregard for the principles of open international dialogue”, the politician said.
In addition, Narishkin called on the OSCE PA participants to re-establish the Russian-EU partnership.
Let's get morality back into politics.
Let us resume dialogue and law in the practice of international communication.
Let us restore humanistic ideals to the democratic world order.
"There never was nothing good left," he said.
From the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group for Ukraine.
I encourage members to focus on the following specific security challenges.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group”, said Narishkin.
He also noted the importance of paying tribute to the OSCE.
“It's almost the only common ground where they're still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine”, stressed the politician.
Remember, the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly was opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until 18 September.
Enjoyed winning a couple or three days.
The world champion on the light athlete Sergey Schubenkov.
This season is a three-year-old light-year-old from Barnaul Sergey SchUBENKOVA.
He managed to win the European Command, set several record points at his 110-metre crown distance, and above all to be the champion of the world, the first time in the history of the national barrier.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final phase of the Brillant League, with the third in a class set.
Sjubenko was asked to share the impressions of the passing season.
Sergei, is the season over for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to address the World Military Games, which will be held in Korea on October, and then I'm going to think about rest.
True, I'm going to be at home now, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a different situation.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said autumn was a favorite time of the year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a wonderful time.
Straws after the main start of the despicable season will no longer bear the load of liability.
You can compete for pleasure, for "slow down."
Plus you know the vacation's about to come...
Is there any fatigue?
It's a special season, a lot of positive emotions...
Fatigue always accumulates by the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what else you're doing more, winning or losing.
Every competition is a stress.
Permanent overflights, relocations, these don't pass through to the body endlessly.
You get physically and emotionally up.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
I'm just happy.
By the time you're done in the world championship in Beijing, do you come back often?
It happens.
You journalists don't let me forget that, either.
But in general, I think that the bad sportsman who's lived with the old victory is throwing his successful race over and over again.
I've been enjoying winning a couple or three days and we've got to move on.
The preparation for this wonderful season was quite different from that of the average?
I can't say there was something special.
We started getting ready in December, but I missed the winter race season.
Training was first a house in Barnaul, then a meeting place, then a house again.
Everything's the usual.
But with the coach, we had the challenge of trying to get to a new level that I was not yet at.
Almost all of this took time to build a base.
We ran a bunch of sneakers, we did all-physical training exercises, which included both the thrust and the seat and the back we rolled.
Then I got in for the barrier training, and I had a lot of equipment.
What do the rivals say they've been watching?
I'm always trying to do it, there's no problem in the Internet age with that.
I watched Europe's winter championship, and there the whole pedestal was taken by the French in the barrier!
I was thinking, there's something else to do, we've got to dispossess this company.
With every start in this season, you added and added results.
Did it bring confidence?
I've got all the last seasons in roughly the same pattern.
There's no one that I'm running first 13.20 and then I'm 13.50.
I always open my uniform gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run away from 13 seconds.
All the work focused primarily on this result.
But the paradox is that I seem to feel like I'm on the move, and at competitions I don't always get ready.
How was that, for example, on the Olympics in London?
I, frankly, tried to forget right away.
It was pretty good, it could actually have run away from 13 seconds.
Even if I were to repeat my best outcome at that time, I would be a bronze prizer in the Games.
But it's not lucky.
Do you remember your first champion of the world?
What about it?
Tegu had it.
I really wanted to get into the finals, it was such a mammal program.
And he departed straight from the morning, in the pre-arrangements.
Then I realized I was tearing and taking a broken head, so I didn't have to run anywhere.
Two years later, at the world championship in Moscow, it was the best time to go to the finals.
I remember my feelings before the decisive race, and I wanted to win the golden.
How do you develop a good speed without losing your head?
And this is the most difficult thing.
You have to be very careful, focused on the technology, so you don't break the barriers.
You've noticed that when you get into a process rather than a result, it's much easier.
And especially when you feel like you're running, like you're getting yourself!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from deep into the first serious success are trying to move closer to the capital.
Never thought like that?
It's still better at home.
I don't know where I'm going without my coach, who's looking for me?
It may be nice to have conditions that are better, but I try to be content with what I have.
You've been together for a while?
Since I was 12 years old, I've been to the slight athletics.
Actually, I was training first with his wife, who was working with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with a syringe and then I jumped in the length of it, tripled.
It was when a ball was metabolized, falling to the length of the space...
When I was 14, I tried running with the barriers, and I liked it.
Since the first run, the second adult level has been met.
That's the way it is.
There's never been a fear of the barriers?
I got to deal with them right away.
But there's always been a lot of work on technology.
There is a great deal of torment over one of them.
But there's no way out of this routine.
The technician needs to travel all the time so that I can wake me up at night, so I can get up and run through the barriers.
All those who saw you run in Beijing say it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually review my escapes, but I couldn't hold back here.
But you have to keep working on efficiency. There's no limit on perfection.
Now don't you worry that a year before the Olympics win, it's going to be a heavy load on your shoulders?
As they say, I will try to meet expectations.
Once you've chosen this road, you've got to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, no extra cargo should feel.
And I agree with him.
The Batar of Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive as to be surprised by the response to an interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are despicable, I understand their bread isn't good. Give it to me. Give it to the enemy.
I didn't speak to the flag, and I didn't speak the same thing, a million times, and I didn't call anyone directly a bastard, and I was a different mess.
All my pseudo-friendly guys were washed away, and then in a second, they mated.
The press release that I'm exposed to is so strong that even me, who's producing the species, I think people are whitened.
It's like he's walking himself, he's coming, you're attacked by a crowd and you're going to mutate.
But I need to know, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm going to hit, old me guys, I'm afraid.
There's no support.
I didn't have any illusions, and now...
The best self-sufficiency in me has always been, so get a bite.
And if you give passports to things like Fred Derst or Monson, they can only be jerks.
It's better for me, the best journalist, to do the job is not fair.
A week ago, in Kiev, Othar Kushanashov described Crimean events in sharp terms:
What you did to the Crimea Peninsula is a crime.
That's what annexation is called.
I believe that the reference to the way the fallen Khrushchev tried to sign, never fit into the general picture of human habitation.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking his living room...
The war is coming from Kremlin, and it's only going to end there.
I'm almost 100% confident that, like the summer of 2008, it started by calling a bastard from the Kremlin.
I have any idea who it might be...
There's not much to live for the Cobzone.
I don't understand he's the greatest artist, why does he need to lick Putin's hands?
Is he losing his apartment?
Well, you took him a monument.
Of course, the people remembered him as an insult to their little family.
And the reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seventh leads in the rating despite attempted attempts by the Ninth to highlight the losing of leaders in Today Show
Carl Stephanović and Lisa Wilkinson were taken to Canberra to cover the impact of the Liberian Party's declaration that the leader's seat would not have been significantly raised by today's ratings.
The ninth morning show was broadcast from the capital of the State after Malcolm Turnbull Toni Abbot was destroyed.
Conservative is Sunrise, with leading David Coch and Samanta Armitage, stuck in London as part of a weekly series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This torture did not seem to matter much to Australian television viewers, although Sunrise had 397,000 spectators in the five largest cities, compared to 339,000 today.
Today was slightly higher than last Thursday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but the figure was less than last Thursday (433,000).
Today has reduced the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August today there were 318,000, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap fluctuated between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, Sunrise has 349,000 spectators, compared to 314,000 per day in September.
It's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, boys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for your clarification.
TODAY was published on Monday, 14 September 2015.
An important news for the Seventh was the amazing debut of 800 Words with the former star series Packed to the Rafters by Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the newly widowed father of the family, who decided to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children, brought together an impressive audience of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics have been wondering if Thomson can handle a popular show alone without a star called Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a loud yes.
The X Factor of the Seventh remained strong at 1,136 million audiences, easily bypassing the Block (8380,000) and TBL Famillies (7260,000).
The seventh was mixed with luck and failure on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5:00 to 17:30) of the new TV station directed by Andrew O'Keefi gathered 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the number jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuyer (6130,000).
On Monday evening, the first half an hour later, Chase Australia collected 520,000 spectators, and the second half an hour it was suppressing 72,000.
Hot Seat got 620,000.
The fall in Chase Australia's ratings on the second night would make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat would still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minoute, who couldn't win McGuyre's show.
It was originally published as Sunrise leading while today remains at the local level.
Three finalists are unanimous in the fact that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret?
Lana Jevon-Felles, Sara McCay and Snéjan Marcoski may have accidentally given an idea of which one will win the Yellowhouse.
A woman who will eventually be left with Sam Wood in Holstyke is surrounded by a secret curtain.
Of course, the three girls who reached the finale are silent about which one of them received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah MacKay, Snowy Marcosski and Lana Jewons-Felose the day before the two girls were to stay, they probably gave us some little clues about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps quiet till the finale, to be held on Thursday
All three women come into the oral mood to explain why Wood is the ideal man, to mention his sense of humor, his commitment, his family values, his happiness as a reason why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But in their answers to the question, "If you do not, who is to receive the last part of Wood?"
Jewons-Fellas and Marcosski call MacKay the perfect couple for Wood.
A good relationship has been established between Sarah and Sam since the first day.
"From the time I was a participant, I felt the energy (Sara) and the energy of Sam and understood that they were very close to each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about it," said Jewons-Fellas.
"Sara is a very open man, easy and fun," added Marcoski.
I saw them together, and there's really a attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sara MacKay thinks she and Sam Wood can make a great couple.
MacKay himself said that as a result of her home visits last week, she realized that Wood might be there, "that's the person. "
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that it's definitely not just a game - I believed him with all my heart," she said.
To the question of who should choose Wood, if that was not her, she replied mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snéjan and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bayelor Show goes on Wednesdays at 1930 on Ten.
Originally published as "Sara is the best choice of Sam Wood?"
Jarrid Hayn had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the United States -- as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hein chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it seems to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayn on the bench for the rest of the ball game that a former Australian league player would have let on his first return to a winning game with Minnesota with an account of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in her player and gave Hein another opportunity to return the Pant and also involved him in the game after the trauma of Reji Bush.
Tomsula was shown to be good after the game, in the locker.
Instead of throwing a stretch of newcomers in the presence of a team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hein at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers Cam Inman Special Reporter reported that Hein had also received support from the coordinator of Thomas McGoy's special teams, who advised him to forget the ball lost and to think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost his ball on his master's return by Minnessot Wykings on the first quarter
At this beginning the debut in the NHL Hayne and his numerous Australian worshipers were clearly not calculated.
It was seen Hein fighting, leaving the field after the loss of the ball, and later he gave the lead show to Hemish and Andy at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which could not imagine a more unsuccessful start for a career in the NFF.
"That's what happens, you're just thinking about the next game and all," Hen said.
He compared his failure to the debut in the Orgin series of games in 2007, when a ball drop in his credit zone attempted Queensland.
In the end, this experience was very useful to the 27-year-old player.
Hein took a picture of the Australian flag and fans after the game and took the Instagram image.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Michael Hodorkowski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of use of weapons at the Siberian airport.
In open challenge to President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were suppressed.
Migrants were clashed with the police along the Hungarian border.
The refugees staged protests on the border of Serbia near the Hungarian town of Reske, which grew into clashes with law enforcement officials.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water and tear gas and handed over Reuters.
Migrants throw stones at the police and try to clear the border fence.
The scene of clashes is reinforced, and the police respond to acts of aggression by migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, refugees were able to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reporting the "B-B-B-Si".
The authorities allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and transport them from there to the appropriate country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened its migration and border protection legislation.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of the State, the prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, and the expedited procedure for the processing of asylum requests.
The Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serb border and will therefore be deported and unable to return to Hungary for a year.
It is also the intention of the Hungarian Parliament to consider handing over to the Hungarian Armed Forces the task of protecting the country ' s border.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a barbed wire of 175 kilometres along the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russian admitted to having committed the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States.
The Russian citizen, Vladimir Drinkman, accused of stealing over 160 million credit - card numbers in the United States, reports Reuters.
At the trial of the Federal Court of New Jersey, Drinkman admitted to a conspiracy to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, a Russian citizen spoke of a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian national, accused of cyberattacks in 15 companies.
Total damages from the actions of the accused were estimated at $300 million.
"As the respondents, Vladimir Drinkman, who has the skills to break our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. attorney Paul Fishman.
Dinckmanu faces 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a million-dollar fine.
When sentencing, the court shall take into account the confession of the Russian Federation and may reduce its term.
The Drinkman verdict will be read on 15 January.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Demetry Smithy, was taken into custody.
The last one is guilty of the crimes that have been alleged against him.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with Russia's support of the Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone call with the head of the Russian Ministry, Sergey Lavrov Secretary of the United States, John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risked exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition to power”, says a communication published on the United States State Department's website.
Kerry reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to combat the faction of the Islamic State (the activity of which is prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary of State, the Asad “will never be able to be a reliable member” of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved by a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
On the eve of the White House Spokesperson Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation unless it stopped supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition that conducts an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media have frequently reported the presence of Russian soldiers in Syrian territory.
To what was said by the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and had helped Syrians to develop technology to use it against Islamists.
Four were killed when police fired rubber bullets at protests in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets in a crowd protesting against the country ' s proposed new constitution, as the official representative had stated on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Bishnu Prasad Dalal, head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protestors had gathered at a police station, some had been throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dalak reported that the police had used tear gas, then fired into the air before rubber bullets were fired.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
Although it is not clear why the rubber bullets, known to be kill, have traditionally led to such high mortality rates as a deadly alternative.
This clash was the last in a few weeks of bitter protests in the southern plain of Nepal, where Mádezi people claim that the new provinces created by the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protesters also took place in western Nepal, among the Taru citizens who want their state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province, a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally managed for several centuries.
The new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
Lawmakers voted in favour of the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week and officials said that a new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sajansk plans to create a 900 job enterprise.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk.
It was built in the 1970s as the centre of the chemical industry and has developed an infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk led the new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
He presented the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects to the correspondent, “Deputy”.
Oleg Valeryvic, where did you get your job as mayor?
I first examined the results of the financial and financial audits and initiated independent audit reviews of local budget expenditure.
Municipal property was then audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce documentation to five days.
Previously, the papers could walk for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the income base and optimize costs.
Last November, a retreat of the Government took place in Sainsk to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
There was no project design document (PAS) in the city.
Without it, Sajansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started with the preparation of the POJ on roads, kindergarten, northern sewer and water.
Road work is already under way on two sections.
How is President of the Russian Federation implementing a decree on the construction of kindergartens?
In July of this year, 105 children were born in Xianzka.
This positive demography has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of childcare facilities is one of the most urgent today.
Since 1 September, it was closed to a total of 320 seats to repair the nursery.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million roubles.
The city has never received such funds.
In the past year, the kindergarten No. 23 opened after the renovation, which is now attended by 200 children.
The renovation was based on regional and local budgets and cost over 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the administration and assistance of the Regional Government, funds have been sought for furniture and equipment, and the People's Initiatives programme has also helped.
There are plans to start building a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the priority of children between the ages of one and three years.
We don't have four kids from three to seven years old.
Investors are interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city has to be carried out, especially by the Sajan enterprises, and that it is their job to do.
Already in October, a 60-centre orphans ' home in Leningradsk microarea is being put into operation.
As for construction, I'm adding that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, which has entered an economic class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
We have all stated the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing for those who wish to participate in the programme.
One condition is that housing should not be more than 30,000 roubles per square metre, which is the value of a key compartment.
If we deal with the amounts that we're asked, we'll continue to participate in the programme.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At the time, the Sayan pig-complect was built on the Territory, and was sold for insignificance in 2004.
We are working with the Prosecutor's Office to challenge this transaction.
Even more so, the land is in federal ownership.
Work is under way with Moscow, the issue of 88 hectares to regional property is being decided, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest in the reconstruction and launch of the 1.5 billion roubles project.
With a pig-complect, we'll have 900 jobs, which will be a big help to the city.
Have we developed an institution of social partnership in Sainske?
We have about 140 treaties of socio-economic partnership.
Few projects have been implemented because of the strong social position of business representatives.
Enterprises such as East Central, Novo ZET, SA BI, MDF PAC, and the management of these enterprises respond to all requests.
Directly to the day of the U.O.O.C., the city of the town of the town of the town of O.O.C. has been given a gift of more than 1 million roubles by the East Centre.
Thanks to sponsoring funds, the town's property has been improved.
The sponsors helped to celebrate City Day with beauty.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of urban groups and organizations.
A record of the city, a book of Xian poets, was released.
The primary planners and people who have made a serious contribution to the development of Sayanska have been provided with jewelry medals.
Places also participate in the town charity fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 roubles are aimed at supporting talented children, assisting children in need of expensive treatment, and supporting children from low-income families.
How are human resources problems in the social sphere dealt with in Saissca?
There is a shortage of medical and teaching practitioners in the city.
Provision of housing is essential to address the staffing issue.
During the past year, we had allocated five homes for doctors, and four teachers received office accommodations.
We have a housing programme with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
In the plan, a building will be re-planned to accommodate eight more teachers' apartments.
Teachers and doctors are also participating in the Housing for the Russian Family programme.
For the future, building a home for workers in the budget area.
Most importantly, there's a working team in town that I can deal with the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential for Sayanska and our region is great.
A draft law on social security indexing has been introduced in the Douma, taking into account price increases.
In the State Duma, a bill has been introduced that provides for the indexing of social pensions every year since 1 February, taking into account price increases.
The author of the document, Alexander Lomkin-Rumians, a member of the “Justy Russia”, also proposes additional indexing of pensions on 1 April if the rate of growth of subsistence exceeds the rate of growth in the prices of goods and services.
Subsidies are indexed annually, according to the legislation in force, from 1 April, taking into account the growth rate of the minimum subsistence level of the retiree in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law introduced to the lower chamber provides for the introduction of social pensions indexing based on the rate of consumer price increases.
The first indexation is carried out on 1 February and the second on 1 April.
The OSCE Head of the PA announced to Mogerini that sanctions against parliamentarians would not be imposed.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Federika Mogerini, Speaker of the PA OSCE, Ilkka Kanerwa, declared that sanctions against legislators participating in the meetings of the Assembly were inadmissible.
This was reported by a member of the Russian delegation to the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar Nikolai Kovalev.
The signing of European parliamentarians, including the representatives of Cyprus, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, in support of Canerva's position, is reported to have been compiled in support of the position.
"There has been strong enough support," said Covalev.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had acted with the intention of collecting signatures from deputies, which had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians could not be imposed.
In particular, Kovalev noted that Kanerwa has promised to raise the problem to the level of European Union leadership and to “send the petition”.
NHC reported that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Cape is 60 per cent
The broad low pressure area front, approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the Southern tip of the Green Cape is likely to turn 60 per cent into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, and reported on Tuesday to the National Hurricane Centre of the United States.
Another well-defined low pressure area around midway between the Green Cape and the Small Antilles also has a 60 per cent chance of creating a tropical cyclone in the next two days, communicating synaptics with Miami.
Google is launching a donation double campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a doubling campaign to collect $11 million for humanitarian organizations to assist European countries to flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used a non-sacrificial personal approach, while denouncing its collection campaign on its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, a Google staff member, Rita Masood, who had fled from Kabul when she was seven, described her personal experience.
"We traveled by doubt trains and buses and endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many people like my family are desperately in need of assistance.
Donations will be handed over to four non-profit organizations working in the field of refugees and migrants: “Doctors without Borders”, International Rescue Committee, Save the Child and Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until it reached $11 million on google.com/refugeerelief.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has moved more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Obesity surgery can help you with low obesity.
The beneficial effect, after surgery, of obesity, of type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is now too early to argue that low - obesity diabetes lives longer after obesity surgery than non - surgeons.
"The mortality statistics aren't showing up immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgeon who wrote about a new study in the column of the JAMA Surgery editor.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the stomach size.
They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the ability of the bodies to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been carried out among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (IMT) 35 or more.
ITC, weight relative to growth, is considered normal at the value of 18.5 to 24.9.
IT 25 or more indicates that a person has an excessive weight and that persons with ITI above 30 are considered to be people with obesity.
You can calculate your CMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Taiwan Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare the two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypassing and holstery gastroctomy, with type 2 diabetes treatments for people with low obesity.
The mid-term importance of ITC has fallen from 31 to 24.5 per cent by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the ITC remains approximately 29.
Of those who had undergone the operation, 36 per cent had been cured completely and 28 per cent had been partially treated.
In the group receiving medical treatment, only 1 per cent of diabetes was compared, and in part only about 2 per cent.
In addition, blood pressure rates, triglycerides and "fright" LPNP of cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors claim.
The researchers also controlled the blood hemoglobin A1s levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in the blood dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better retained than 7%, and the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8 per cent.
But the best gylimatic indicators, reflected by the good levels of hemlobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate over five years, according to the research manager, Dr. Chi Cheng Soo and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatments.
By the fifth year, as compared with the group that filled the gestromium, the bypassing group had lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), had achieved a greater decline in the ITI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglybine A1s (3.1 per cent against 2.1 per cent), as well as closer to a full diabetes remission (46.9 per cent against 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of a surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of persons with excess body mass in Sweden that surgery does lead to an increase in life expectancy, as Blackstone of the College of Medicine at Finix University, Arison, reports.
According to a Swedish study of obesity survivors, the likelihood of death for 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than that of a more traditional group.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encouraged people with ITC below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“The report here is very important because it claims that such surgical intervention is safe in a group with low ITI where there is no increased risk of death or renal disease”, she stated.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors must begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to make people take it seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they have a genetic change that causes obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to reverse that.
In the Mists, the robbers removed the shuba and the roubles of 9 million.
In the Mists, the robbers attacked the residents of the house of the house and stole 9 million rubles and 3 women's coats.
This is informed by Interfax, referring to the MUP Press Service of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown through the open door entered a house on the street of Gorka, bound a 20-year-old son of a housewife, and threatened both with a knife and abducted 9 million rubles and three coats.
Presumably, the damages amounted to 9 million roubles, and criminal proceedings under the heading “Dizzy” have been initiated.
Fans in Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 Petrburgers have the right to host tourists who will come to watch the soccer championship in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are not in a rush to obtain a permit.
In the opinion of the experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to world domination, the authorities will have to think about how to house all the visitors to the city.
The "Rosbalta" interlocutors believe that because of the tournament, the cost of rented apartments would increase by 10-30 per cent, and after the championship, they would have to overpaid.
The world football champions had caused the authorities to pay attention to the state of the Russian hotels.
According to a law specifically written under title, every Peterburg hotel must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it is consistent with the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is clear now that not all will be able to do so: hotelers are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents to the Pterburg Federal Antimonopoly Service.
According to UFAS Head Wadim Vladimiri, an agency has examined 138 hotels and is now planning 34 hotel cases, many of which have simply not responded to antimonopoly users.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies has deceived citizens by placing a number of stars in an advertisement, noted the Vladimirs.
The problem is, it's literally every number right now, not one of them will be lost before 2018.
The officials suspect that all Petrburg hotels will be taken by the fans during the football championship.
In the city, tourists are now able to count 30,000 rooms.
In Petersburg, 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100-two- and three-star hotels, and 550 one-on-one hotels are reported to be in Smolaya.
According to the First Deputy Tourism Development Committee, Nana Gwivicia, only 23 hotels have so far been classified - so many accredited companies in Petersburg.
Whether a hotel was ordered by regional enterprises is not known.
That is, those that have been classified can be more, but no one knows.
"The last six months, hotels haven't been very keen on the classification," admitted the director of the Northwest Office of the Russian Union of the Ekaterine Shadska industry.
This is due to the high season during which drivers earn the most money and refuse to do other things.
Another reason is that the budgets in which no verification costs have been recorded may be for the hotel, depending on the status of 30 to 100,000 roubles or more.
However, in recent times hotel managers have stepped up and submitted applications for classification, and they have assured Shadsky.
The hotels will have to wait until July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine, nor will they have the right to work in the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the starry, a fixed plate payment will be developed for the hotel during the tournament.
The formulas for which the value will be calculated are published next year.
This is done in order to avoid a price takeover of 200 to 300 per cent, such as during the Peter Economic Forum.
We need to have a conscience and avoid a two or threefold increase, but the hotels also have to make a living.
"I think growth will be up to 50%," explained the President of the Russian hotel association, Hennadiy Lamshin.
In turn, the Vadami Vladimirs are not sure that the pricing is consistent with the market economy.
I don't know how well this is within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this is a legitimate measure.
"It's better than a continuous journey," he said.
It's not clear what's gonna happen to popular low-cost hostels.
Members of the State Committee have introduced a bill prohibiting hostels in the home.
It is very hoped that this law will not be passed or related to Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that the hostels should be preserved”, Nana Gwacia said.
However, she said that the owner of the mini-optics should be prepared in any case to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State does approve the bill, approximately 80 per cent of the hostels will be closed in Petersburg, with 1.5 thousand for the time being.
According to the President of the Federation of Rectors and Drivers of North-West Leonida Garbar, there are two and three-star hotels in Petersburg that are required by football fans, but there is a distortion towards hotels with four and five stars.
Such a situation is similar to that of “the 80-month-old stadium sitting 75,000 pros."
It can be fixed at the expense of the mini-measurers.
Their possible ban is considered a "idiotism" by the expert: "I don't think it's weird that some people can live in apartments, but that's why they can't come."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, I agree it's wrong.
But if, as a hotel to which guests visit for a short time, why not?
The ladies are risking missing the World Cup and because they're not very quick.
Hundreds of little hotels are just not able to get through the classification process, and they are growing up with themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels will be ordered to work.
“Camps that may not carry out this procedure are not so much, so they will give up less paid orders from mini-holsters, but will choose which travels”, said Hennadiy Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, these checks have been performed far above the Petrburgs.
The reason for Petrburg ' s delay is that it is not conducive to smooth work, including permanent relocations in the Government ' s tourist bloc.
In the opinion of the experts, if the Petrburg hotels are not enough, it is likely that attention will have to be paid to the regional hotels and rest homes.
An example of the 300th anniversary of Petersburg can mobilize a river fleet, that is, visitors to the tournament can live in cabins.
In addition, many of the fans will be prepared to arrive at a van where they can stay overnight.
I'm sure Hennadiy Lamshin is sure.
Removable housing will also be popular during football.
It's probably the city that's going to create a reserve of rented apartments.
Rental rates are going to grow by 10-30 percent.
"The obvious is that the first to leave the apartment near the stadium," said a specialist in the rental of the Agency for Development and Real Estate Research in Larissa Bragin.
At the same time, the rental price may not return to its original level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
The construction of new traffic interchanges on the outskirts of the city would also contribute, she stressed.
Do not forget the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is confident that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city where people are not just showing off the road, but they can also conduct a mini-exploration.
There are also complications.
In the 1970s, my dad met a family from Murmansk, a father, a mother, and two children.
They found it hard to sleep with hotels at the train station.
"And dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," he remembered.
True, he added that at the moment, there's no such thing left in the city. Calling his home would have an effect, and it's scary.
But in 2018, after the bad decisions of the Lord, the mistakes of hotels and governments will have to be remembered.
Zhirinsky "sil" Amur province.
I've looked at the Cloone of Zyrinowski in the Lord with admiration today.
He did these things when our generation was only learning to trade in newspapers, and he is still in beautiful shape.
The topic of the statement, I think, is “LDPR against the results of the Amur region elections”.
The protocols do not shake - nothing; there do not appear to be any other protocols, except those signed by the electorate.
He picks up Ivan Abramov's second seat and cries out, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And here, there's nothing going on for Rodney, and then, after a break with the president, he takes the faction out of the conference room, literally "You're all with your gutters and thieves".
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov but on scandals and demarche factions as a result of this scandal and insult.
Real Volfowitz is beautiful and elegantly out of Amur region along with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is the final issue of the Zyrinowski in the "Pondors" style, not the political party's protest against the results of the specific elections.
And the faction was formalized, and the elections, if you believe the party website and Facebook, Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader is clearly getting off the board.
Proposes the dead on Amoire to bury their dead, while he himself gives good news against One Russia in general, and in nothing but his wife.
An outstanding decision, so that the person does not lose, and the real one, not the show scandal, does not go.
Another matter is that Abraham is now in a strange position.
Except for the starters, he didn't wait, there's no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, it is for the narrow side that he has been a formal both to insult the distinguished champion and, more importantly, to the Hami ' s EP and FNL raids.
And here, of course, is where he needs to think seriously about what he's going to do.
Because from the primary beneficiary of the elections, the policy number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 of the single regional single-person district, it could become a couple who benefited from their own party leadership and their super-sensor for the same ONF and the party leadership of a stranger.
Of course, it wouldn't be Zirzynowski who should have thought it out and watched it almost happen.
The tram will still grow and grow before it.
It was news that LDPR would return to the hall at the next plenary.
So the banya has fallen from nothing at all.
One thing is Abram's theme is buried.
It's beautiful.
"It's not possible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre in Oxford on ethics research at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity must be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while that was a source of admiration, Western European responses to the refugee crisis were not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you must think about durable solutions to bring true peace and real development, primarily through education, to these Muslim countries”, he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In terms of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following terrorist acts 9/11, stating that the United States' hard reaction had set in motion a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to the problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children swallowing a disinfectant for hands over the last four years
The toxicological centres in the United States reported an increase of almost 400 per cent, beginning in 2010, in the number of children under 12 years of age who had swallowed a decontamination drug for high alcohol hands, according to the Georgia State Toxicology Centre.
According to Dr. Xylord López, director of the Georgia State toxicology centre, the incidence of hand-inflation by children under 12 years of age has increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are in contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately some of them are sent to the ambulance,” said López CNN.
He explained that some children drink a decontamination liquid on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends or to argue on social networks.
Videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking decontamination fluid as a cheap drink.
Adolescents were reportedly mixed with disinfecting liquids containing alcohol - resistant mouth fluids to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smells of disinfecting liquids.
"The baby doesn't think it's going to hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most inviting (hand decontamination fluids) are those that are scented.
There are decontamination fluids for hand with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
Hand - decontamination contains between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol.
Small children, especially a few crucifixes, can cause alcohol poisoning.
“This is high - concentration alcohol,” said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief toxicology doctor at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a scooter with a whiskey, but people keep in mind these disinfecting hands, and if the children get there, that's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naji Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a strawberry - smelling handbag at school, about four crucifixes, was sent for treatment to the ambulance.
Her blood level was 179 more than that of an adult who is legally considered to be in a state of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchi, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Najija was confused with words and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance.
The doctors observed her all night in a separate child clinic to keep track of any signs of brain trauma because of alcohol the girl fell and hit her head and told Ritchi.
"That was very scary," said CNN Orthoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
It may well have been deadly for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-smoker substances or disinfectants of straws, in addition to removing decontamination fluids from the hands of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some decontamination fluids are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethylene alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three four-year-olds in the north of New York agreed to poison their “enemy” teacher by “disseminating antibacterial substances in the classroom”, according to a police report.
The teacher had a lot of allergies on hand disinfectors, and she didn't keep them in her classroom.
The police believe that the failed plan was “pure talk” and that the discipline of the school district was addressed.
The oldest library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the N.K. Grand child library, there's a weird owl.
Young people who come for books try to feed their books.
For several generations now, the library has been there for 95 years.
The first readers of the past 20 years had arranged loud readings, plays at the poems of Mayakowski, literary exhibitions, and correspondence with Lenin’s wife.
The rewriting continued for four years, and, as the U.N. newspaper of 1939, “the friendship between the Hope of Constantine's Group and the friends of the Barnaul child library was becoming stronger each day.
Constantine's hope even sent her baby photo to distant barnal friends once.
And when the barnaulants asked if Hope Constantinein was opposed to the library calling her name, he wrote that he did not.
Letters have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and great - grandchildren of the early readers have to explain whose harsh profile the library’s library building is.
During the adjustment years, a number of people frequently called, resented why the library was not renamed?
Let there be a library called a good kid writer, without any political colouring!
They sat down, they thought, and they decided to leave everything there.
"Magic" is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul as "Lenna" in Moscow.
On the floor of the library lobby is a track of yellow bricks.
"The Wizard of the Famous City" is the favorite subject of the artist Ola Moscow.
In the past, Ola had been the manager of a legal firm, had come to work at eight, had gone to five, and all the other managers had been different only from their love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet saying, "You need an illustration for a book."
A little American girl wrote a book, and she called her "My cancer's mom."
Ola made illustrations, and thought that life could end at any time, and there wouldn't be any miracles in it unless you made it yourself.
She now works in the library, illustrates the children's books of writers around the world, and makes fairy tales herself.
Traditionally, children are deemed to be losing interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we've got children who read, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, and they say, "Russky Planet," the director of Tatian Kushwed's library.
In recent years, we've even come up with a moment of confidence that a library is needed, and she'll live -- kids are coming here!
I think interest in reading comes back.
In the Library Lobby, there is a big exposition with the updated photo analysis.
Once a block is filled with new photographs of readers who go to the library for the entire family: Mom, Dad, and children.
In the library, it's been a joy to see fathers come with the children.
When a child is only two years old, he needs more complex books when he is older.
But now there is a law under which an eight-year-old vanderkina is prohibited from publishing books in category 12+.
To get this book, a child has to bring his parents back, they come back, and then they come back again, and gradually, the Red becomes something like a family club for them.
There's a treasure in the library, a pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and oremas, to lead the King in the annex to the magazine Niwa, bound for the "Mursics" of 1936.
After all, we're not just about the conceptual space of the book temple, we're now open to movement, we're trying to be a special place -- not home, not work, not school -- explains Tatian Kushvid.
We can come to read, play, paint.
We made a play zone for a baby -- the baby comes to play, and the hand is still reaching for the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they hold back with their legs, not wanting to leave.
Mothers often come with wheelchairs, and we're happy that the library places them in the top of all the other places to come with the babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says that today's children like we once loved classical child literature:
"The work of the government is developing and a lot of attention is being given to authors who are the link between generations."
And when it comes to small babies, it's important for them to have some kind of hero that travels from one book to another.
Children don't like breaking up with their heroes.
The Library regularly issues parents ’ tracts, telling them what is happening in modern - day children’s literature, what books are worth noting, and why.
Bookbooks are so exciting and intriguing, and adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is prohibited for adults to produce books outside the reading room.
It's a magical privilege only for children.
...in the most distant library room, there's a square hatch with an ancient wooden ladder in the basement, in the bookstore.
You're going to be sobbing under your steps that it's a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood, you meet with an old friend: hello, good that you and I don't change.
Ellie is still as much fun to walk along the road with the yellow brick, the Tol Ryzykow tape is stealing magic matches, and Malcolm-Kibalche has never told the damned burgers of the Military Priv, he's like that.
Books like peacocks, you can find out where you're going.
There's a collection and a real book rare -- a pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and eras, for example.
Or lead the King in the famous annex to the magazine Niva.
Or the "Mursics" mat in 1936.
It was time for pages to grow old, and it colored them in tea.
These publications are no longer published by readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, and I wish I could retire and handle rare children's books.
But the kids don't know, and the old books don't look very bright, and the themes... open the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now I think, why did we all write this Pioneer Truth?
But it was interesting anyway to talk about the Russian planet, Halina Ilassov, who's a bookstore.
The Merzika pages were darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilovna has a bookstore for the rest of his life.
She knows the colour of the cap in Buratino, in which academic year Harry Potter became captain of Gryffindor's team at the Buckingo champion, where Carlson uses the motorist's silencer, and who's Alice Seleznewa's father working for.
There is little to pay for the library, and everyone who can live without these books is finding themselves a different profession very quickly.
The only ones who are convinced are educators, educators, teachers of the cult of the book.
You can also find them by smiling -- it's thought to be a professional feature of a kids' library.
If he smiled at you for the first minute, that's a professional.
I like children's books at all, and I like to see that they are just and beautiful, and I love them to read, and I love reading them, and I say, "Galina Vasilvan."
I read everything: military, historical, fairy, fiction.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and fascinating thing that ever happened to me.
And since I loved them foolishly, it seemed to me that the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the redheads.
And I'm happy when our ex-readers bring our children, or even our grandchildren...
Hearing mill: There is no disagreement in Celtika
Griffiths refuted the disagreements of Celtik after Dale admitted that Hups are in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Nelson and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt the unity of the team
"Dons" increased the advantage of "Seltic" to five points.
Adam Runy's Penalty, in its first half-time, gave Aberdin a little advantage over the Heilton in Pitcairn, which allowed the Dons to turn five points away from the Celtika.
Griffith refutted disagreements
This led to rumours of disagreements in the Celtika, which Griffiths, saying that he and his teammates suffered no further criticism while preparing to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the tension, I think the players want him.
Dutch people are bored because Scottishs aren't fighting for title, where Bur
An ex-worker from the Rangers and a former Dutch member from Ronald de Boour stated that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtika because he was not fighting for title with Rangers.
Where Bur, now the representative of Ajax, said, "The most attractive moments in Dutch no longer show us the most attractive moments in the game of Saltica, why?"
It's because it's not Rangers.
People here are not just talking about getting back to Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in Old Company games, and not just people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'm all a shift," Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtik was under pressure, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
As a result, 10 Aberdine football players soon lost their way out of the League of Champions, which now stands on the top of the table at five points.
Dale, however, said, "We had bad times before, and we'll come out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very unfortunate, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And we, too, but we have to keep going.
And we really do need the support of Celtika, because that players are getting a lot better.
Staying together right now is so important.
Warberton waits with mistrust for January ' s transfers
Despite the views of only a few weeks ago that he assumed that he had defined some of the objectives of the January transfers, Mark Warberton's boss of the Rangers had mistakenly referred to the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
A former attacker, Brandford, said, "The January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in summer, you have a period before the season to adapt them, which you saw in our own group in this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
The science that Celtik wondered about was about the end of his career.
The attacker, Sonsy Mitch, linked to Seltic during the transfer window, implied that he could leave football after his contract with Lebeds was over.
A 29-year-old player suffered from a ankle problem for two years and failed to leave Wales this summer.
Harts is going to oppose SFA on Neilson's claims.
Harts was driving at 2:1, when Patterson was removed, and began losing 3:2, but the defence's red card was later cancelled; this is Collum's third red card, which was cancelled in eight months.
And Nelson doesn't give up on his words, saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffith vowed to avoid Tinckslas.
Heibernian's stubborn player was given a speech after he acknowledged that he was singing a song with abusive words about the former Harts player Rudy Skele.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area in Edinburgh, before the start of the Edinburg derby in Tinckslas, in March 2014.
"It was a drabby, and it was a burning one," the attacker said, adding, "I can say with certainty that I wasn't going to go back to Tynkols if he doesn't play for Celtic."
Donnelly, the Council of Tannadis is confident in the management of Dundy United.
Simon Donnelly claims that the board of directors of Dunde United continues to be confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deteriorating situation on the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the boys to go out again," Donnelly said.
McInness is happy that "inaudible" won the "Hamilton"
Derek Macinness admitted that his team, Aberdeen, had to fight desperately against the Humilton Assis to win the seventh consecutive race, which placed them at five points above Salika, on the top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runy's First Tayme Toolbar.
McIness said, "There isn't a team here that can win something -- a cup or a league champion who doesn't win a meeting like that."
The unemployment rate among Scottishs does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is increasing
THE number of people in Scotland remained 164,000 between May and July, while the number of non-working in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher for the United Kingdom than 5.5 per cent, as indicated by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in three months, with the number of workers currently working at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland has declined one quarter to 74.0 per cent above the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
David Mandela, Minister of Scotland, commenting on the latest figures, said, "The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy."
Almost exactly a year has elapsed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain with the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the labour market in Scotland, with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why I'm a witness to the execution in Oklahoma
Today, while avoiding legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch a human being executed.
If that happens, and I hope I don't, I'm going to sit on the death row in Oklahoma Prison, when Richard Glosip is executed with a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was in shock, I agreed.
With the arrival of this day, I became afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story about the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to be present at American executions, and because more than ever before, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press spaces was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'm going to be sitting with Richard Glass's closest friends, and he and I had our own relationship after a few months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take the notebook and pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try and remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of being impartial at Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, getting access.
I complained to her.
She acknowledged that she could better formulate herself, but she still believes that I am wrong in what I do.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with one of the things I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said it.
I told him he could turn me off his witness list any time.
But he wants an international journalist to attend to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that transparency will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, the Haffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the feeders I've written.
I'm not going to go into the details here again.
I can't say I'm sure Richard Glossip wasn't responsible.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of aiding the crime.
But I believe there's a great likelihood that he's not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that the evidence for the death penalty has not been sufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'll watch him die.
I can't say I'll be completely objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact.
You'll find out what it's like to watch someone I love die without ever having to.
The man under investigation was forced out of the Canning River by the police
The Constable, from Canning Valley City, has succeeded in telling people to get out of the Canning River and to stay dry.
Perta's resident intended to leave the police but didn't get it, stuck in dirty water in a shallow boat a few meters from a police officer trying to "let him walk ashore".
The Canning-Weila police was called on Tuesday to illegally enter a foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police saw the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself into Canning.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I won't leave, come, grab me," said Senior Sergeant Chandell Castledin.
The Laklana Perhavez Constable didn't really want to look like a uniform, so he used a safer reception -- "a negotiation with a good cop."
"Sometime people do weird things to try to escape," says Senior Sergeant Castledin.
Ben Kazins, the champion football player, remembers that.
In 2006, Kazins left to escape a police patrol to check on alcohol, and tried to cross Seon.
His efforts have been in vain, but they have made the locals use the Bea Kazins joke.
Peter Moody accused the flight attendants of trying to espionage and threatened to leave horse sports.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to put a spy in his horsehouse last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
His target was the flight attendants and members of the Raming Victoria Ethics Division, whom he accused of organizing a personal campaign against him, and the removal from the beginning of Lady Tatai because of the violation of the rules of use of drugs on the day of launch, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to participate in the leaps, and he found himself in a difficult situation in which it was a positive result of Lidari's sample of cobalt, which he can't explain.
He was speaking about espionage for one and a half years, and he didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been through it for a long time, but sometimes it beats you so much out of your lap that you don't hold it back," Moody said.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive, and I have to live with what I said.
Today, I'm going home and I'm going to sleep fast.
I want to walk with my head high, and I want my owners to know -- I do everything I can for them.
When they start to think they're not, then I need to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody used to make a sensational statement during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department had been trying to spy in his stable.
"A year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stuart sat in a room with a person I would call if asked for, and offered him a job in my stable to share information about what I'm doing in the stable," said Moody on Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly all have an application, as I have not been successful in trying to catch them.
Robert Rollton, former president of RVL, David Moody, the current president of RVL, and Bernard Sondrey, the external executive director of RVL, knew about it all along and they know it now.
Should it not make me think that the case becomes personal?
Shouldn't RVL take courage and call for an answer for what's happening in this business, other people than the trainers?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now, maybe make them think about it.
But I'm now at a point where I don't care, and that's what makes me sad.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and take responsibility for their decision-making.
I have family support and I can leave.
The trainer's downfall only grew during a long investigation into the Cobalt and Lidari cases, and the last off of the horse's head forced him to state that he could “get his license on the table”.
Moody, most well known for preparing the indescribable champion Black Caviar, described the medical requirements of the day’s “smarty” competition after a clay compress on the horse’s feet, which is in violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on the jumps.
"I must be fully responsible for this," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put pressure on her leg.
She could have been pressuring yesterday night.
She could get it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him the day she ran.
Moody may be disqualified for three months according to the daily drug competition, which was followed by the chief of the investigation.
It's anecdote.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it's too far away," Moody said.
The driver who took the ride and who disappeared from the Kabram accident, was arrested
The police arrested a man who killed a motorcycleist in Cobra on the weekend and fled the scene.
A motorcyclist was taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital on a helicopter with serious injuries after he was hit by a car at Murray Welly Hayway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver had left without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the town of Natalie surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene of the accident, not showing aid and violating other traffic rules.
The Motocyclist, a 40-year-old, is still in hospital in stable condition.
Craig Bellamy, a coach in Melbourne Storm, heates up the accusations of rivals in the use of hard-power techniques
Craig Bellamy, a coach in Melbourne Storm, described as a criticism of the interception of the ball by his team as “the imposition of an agenda” on the part of two NRL champions.
Trent Robinson, a trainer, Sydney Rusters, stated that the judges had allowed the Party to “fight” with his team during the sudden victory of the Storm at the final qualification game in Sydney on Friday evening.
Wayne Bennett's coach, Brisbein Broncos, made a clear hint for "Stram" after his team won the final qualification tour at Nosern Queensland Caubos on Saturday night, when he called this game "the typical" for the league and said that two of the Queensland team were not "the success of" in a hand-wrotting pit.
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball with his team and said they were just focused on "tactute", intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was confident to criticize his team by two leading coaches, which means that they are concerned about the possible defeat of the Party.
"This continues to blow--I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about the rigids when they played us with an account 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can tell you, we haven't changed anything all year in our systems or defence equipment, just in the last six weeks, we've given special attention to contacts in the interception of a ball, and that's a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's clearly training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's kind of a shock to him.
It's funny, as it always happens at this time of the year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "smart football," reminding his teacher that St. George-Illagarra Dregons had won Bennett's 2010 championship, showing a "fairy" football.
Wayne's talking about the exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and to see how impressive their games were,” he observed Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized by a lot as a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care about it at all.
But now he's got a team that can show what he thinks is an impressive football, especially his young paratroopers at their speed.
It's a football game you want to play when you have these players.
He made that observation in 2010, and now he wants everybody to play soccer in his style -- not every team has two paralegals like Anthony Millford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
This gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing with us.
They probably didn't think about us six weeks ago when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the "Strams" and "Rusters" were competitions with more points than the "Broncos" and "Caubos" games.
Broncos was probably good, I haven't seen her yet, but what was the score?
At our game he was 20:18, there were two other attempts -- and what, is that a impressive football?
Or are they impressive breaks and failed attempts?
It's routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
In Storma at the end of this week of the weekend, because they won the right to take over either the North Queensland Caubois or the "Cronalla Church" next Saturday evening at the preliminary finale at the AAMI Park stage, the tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
Accused of possession of drugs, the recruitment was released on bail of $200,000
A man facing life imprisonment for trying to get 40 kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on bail at $200,000.
Marco Maximović, 29 years old, is one of the five people arrested last month after the Federal Police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Soray boat across Vanuatu from South America and docked in Kumer in August.
During the morning, Maximović and his associates were seen at the docks, and later he met them at the Coomarea Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although Maximović risks life expectancy for attempts to assign drugs in quantities sufficient for sale, counsel Maximović argues that there is no evidence that the latter was trying to get the whole batch, and that the man could be kept in a cafe without any intent.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flangan had doubts that Maximović was worth bailing.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He travels a lot to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Mothers and others, Maximovic, were asked to contribute a joint bond of $200,000 for his release.
“It becomes evident from both statements that the amount of collateral $200,000 is too much of a financial burden for them,” observed Judge Flengan.
But one measure is not enough to guarantee that he will not disappear, adding a judge.
Maximović was allowed bail, provided that he would hand over both his Australian and Serbian passport, be registered with the police every day and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Fotis Kacicaris, I'm on guard against Greece, which fought until the last seconds.
The chief Greek trainer, Fotis Katikaris, paid tribute to his team after the match 1/4 of the finals of the Eurobasket 205 with Spain (71:73).
He says that the fate of the game has solved some mistakes.
It's been a big game, and it's cited AFP Kacikaris.
We were preparing for a great game of Spanish performance.
They tried to work in defense, but the errors in the defense determined the future of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland, "I'm going to be entrusted with CSOs as Kauna."
A CSA kid, Joel Freeland, said he didn't believe in an army curse.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the euroliga in the next season.
I spoke with Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer, and myself, after I joined the team, quoted as "P-Sport" Freeland.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to change to the center position, but in NBA, I'm playing a farvard more.
Now we're going to have to face more of a major rival, but I've been doing this before, so I think I'll be able to do it now.
The Armenians won the last Eurolig in 2008.
Since then, they've traveled six times to Five Four, but they couldn't show up their best basketball.
It's as if the team has smoothed out.
That's the game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's hard, I understand all the frustrations of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance of winning the Eurolig, I really think.
I've always wanted to win this title, Moscow has already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSA.
As for the slate, I am not a superstitious man, nor do I believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you connect these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before games, I just listen to music, and I try to relax as much as possible.
"To me, the "Roma" match will be special."
Luis Henrique, chief coach of Barcelona, returned to Rome for the first class of the League of Champions group, with a special sense of mind.
According to the mentor, the exact combination of his present and former team would be far from simple.
Recall that Luis Henrique trained the oxs during the 2011/12 season, but was not able to show up better in the capital city of Italy.
I went back to Rome a few years later, for which I learned some things.
With Rome, I have extremely warm memories.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The key is to start championing the League.
The Augustus meeting in the Cup of Cup, Joan Hamper, will not affect the team's actions in the nearest match.
I'm looking forward to the "Rome" game she showed in the A series against Juventus.
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Voody Scrippenko: The Red-Draft has different types of attackive action.
The Acting Chief Coacher, Urala, Vadim Skripchenko, in the run-up to the 9th round of the Prime League with the Greenmark, noted the diversity of the attackers' systems of the rival team.
According to the mentor, the bulls have several attack models in their arsenal.
It will be held on 21 September and will begin at 16.30 a.m. in Moscow.
Let's see how we'll play with the Craftard's, get the official version of the word "Star" from Shripchenko.
We've got a week ahead of us.
This team has different targeting options, multiple attacks, but we're not slow, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that the Krasnodar is taking the League of Europe match against Dortmund, we're getting very well prepared to win.
"Astana's House can pick out points from anyone."
The "Astani" defender, Rocher Cañas, after the first round of the Group tour of the League of Champions with the "Benfi" (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
In the opinion of the habubeek, the Aztecs are able to pick points from any rival.
Even though the game was hard for us, I can say we played well, and the official Web site of UFA gives the words of Kanyasa.
Benfik is above the class, but in the home match, I think we can count on taking the glasses.
That's pretty real.
But first you have to think about the Galatasarea, then you have to think about the Atletico.
At home matches, we can pick points from anyone.
Raphael Benítez: The second time, Krystyana Ronaldo is the best in the world.
The Chief Coacher of the Reala, Rafael Benites, expressed satisfaction with the major victory in the 1st tour of the League of Champions group, with Schater (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to the Forvard Kristian Ronald, who had become the author of three heads.
The game was not easy, because Schachter knows how to own a ball, brings up the official Web site of UFA with the words of Benites.
There were no many things in the rival's hands, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I'm not saying "Real" was playing perfect, but we had enough googly opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss the balls and killed four.
Krishtyan Ronaldo confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I repeat it as many times as I like.
Jordy Alba: "Crischtian Ronaldo can't be compared to Messa."
Jordy Alba's Protector of Barcelona believes that no one will be able to compare with his friend Leone Massey.
According to the Spanish, Krishtian Ronald can't do that either.
The Mass is above the other five, and quotes Le Figaro Alba.
Even Krishtian Ronald.
With Leo on the field everything changes, I can't compare him to anyone.
Danielle De Rossi: Barcelona has not only unique styles, it also has brilliant personalities.
The "Roma" defender Daniele De Rossi, on the eve of the party tournament of the Champions League with Barcelona, noted the importance of compactness and support in a game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will be tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
Remember, "SE" will hold its text broadcast.
Barcelona is a special rival, a good team of great players, and quotes UFA's official site De Rossi.
It's hard to play with blue granatiks, because they have not only a unique style, but also brilliant personalities.
To keep them, we'll have to smell all over the match and protect each other.
Masses are almost always successful when going down, so we need to keep them compact and orderly.
We're looking forward to starting out with the SSA on the match with the Sloan.
Golkiper Ska Ilja Ejov stressed that he hopes to have the Armenians on the next ClL championship match.
The crew went out to ice in place of Mikko Koskinen for the 23rd minute at account 0:3 and reflected all the brows at his gate, the fourth leg of the SAA missed after replacing the gate with the sixth field player.
The next match will be conducted by the team on the exit against Slovana.
I hope that I will join the next start-up match, and bring the words of Ejov to the "R Sport".
I'm not an expert on the altar, I'm a liar myself, we don't have any hitheads, so it's hard to track.
"Dinmo" played well, everybody has bad matches.
The team still lost.
I'd rather miss a bigger one, but the team won.

Stephen Hogg used the girl's phone to make pedophiles send photos
Pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered with an Internet message service, where he received a number of indecent images of children sent by other users.
The girl woke up and found the missing phone and found it in the sleeping Hogg's hand.
She checked him and found shocking photographs, and then she immediately drew her mother’s attention.
The police came and saw five images, whereupon they examined the computers found at the address, and found “relevant” search requests using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told the police officer that he did this, because it might be "to attract pedophiles," and then he would "wander he was a cop to scare them."
The Commissioner of Justice, Elied Robertson, informed the sheriff's court in Dunda: "He said it's a passion, he's a bit afraid of people.
He admitted he was making requests on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to act as a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was interviewed about the conversation with an unknown man who sent pictures to him and the fact that he had asked to send pictures.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When she found pictures on the phone, she called her mother, was trembling and cried.
She saw obscenities on the phone, and the accused was given a good rate.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23 years old, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of producing indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating the bail conditions of 25 January this year without appearing before a court of law on 24 March this year.
The defendant ' s counsel, Gregor Sim, requested that the Hogg should not be included in the list of perpetrators of sexual offences, since it could be proved that the crime did not have a “significant sexual element”.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael suspended his sentence until October, until he received a report from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was detained prior to the hearing in other outstanding cases.
He was listed as having committed sexual offences before the date of conviction.
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe reads the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest public leader, fell earlier this year from a run-up ladder.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall scene immediately spread to social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also overshadowed by parliamentary opposition statements that they had received anonymous threats warning them against the use of Mugabe at the time of the address.
A month ago, they developed the President ' s profile during his address to the nation in Parliament, which Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonezé, a member of Parliament for the Democratic Change Movement, stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The communication has come from a number which is not displayed, but is entitled Death," he told the journalists after the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned members of Parliament that integrity was to end in the Parliament building, and that as soon as they emerged, parliamentary integrity was not in effect.
Member of Parliament stated that the party, led by Morgan Tswangirai, was “contested” by its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduced to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard proposes a reduction of between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs through its restructuring and reduction of service delivery costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard is divided into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from more rapidly emerging hardware and service sectors.
The estimated job cuts would result in approximately $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter of the year, as stated in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
"This restructuring will ensure a more competitive, sustainable expenditure structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterrise," said Meg Whitman, President and Director General Hewlett Packard, who will head the organization after division.
"Hewlett Packprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently, and the portfolio of businesses will be bigger and deeper to help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Returne will have an annual profit of more than $50 billion and “will concentrate on providing previously unattainable integrated technological solutions” to companies, as reported in the company's statement.
The company was formed in the 1930s by graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Pacard, to issue electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called “the birthplace of the Kremna Valley”.
Hewlett Packard is in a major reorganization process to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This step by HP, the world's second personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, is a recent development in this sector, based on the confidence that narrow-specialized companies are working better.
The captain of the "Arsenala", Michael Arteta, says that his fellow countrymen must support the traumatised Jack Wilshire before playing the Dinmo Zagreb.
In his conversation with Wilshire Wenger also emphasized that it was September, and provided Wilshire's restoration was planned, he would have nothing to do to get back to the game of Christmas.
Wilshire will miss at least four of the next games in England at the most favourable moment and, given the events that have occurred, his participation in the European championship remains a matter of question for the next summer.
The most recent problem was that Wilshire had ended the previous season with the sole trauma of the ankle and was going to return to the normal aggressive style of the game during pre-trial training.
Wenger: "This trauma isn't threatening his career."
It's just not the rest of the rut.
It's nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not about the ankles or the injuries he's had before.
There may be medically related things, but, as Wenger has also allowed, there is a risk of additional injury for any player returning to the mid-morning game.
There is also an unfortunate trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 Arsenala games in the league over the past five seasons.
If you look at the "Arsenala" schedule more widely, you may notice that in six of the eight seasons, beginning with 2007-2008, "Arsenal" was one of the two prime league clubs that were the most missing of the injuries of the days.
Hungarian recognizes the possibility of being stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenale believes that the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"At some point, when you get back into trouble after the injury, you're vulnerable for a while--when you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough and can handle it.
I hope that he will recover physically, and I am confident that his career will be the one he deserves.
The arena is starting a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with Dinamo Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tuttenham Hotspur, and Wenger plans to rotate the composition.
Héctor Beleerin and Aaron Ramsey didn't come to Croatia, so it's likely that Mother Debusy and Arteta will play the start-up team.
Maybe Wenger will also be introducing Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Jir in place of Nacho Moreala and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep my balance and give a little break to those players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal has an unconditional meal in group F, the Makximir stadium in Zagreb is among the most highly expensive in Europe.
Dinamo hasn't lost one of the 41 matches since they were able to spend the last season as "The Poor."
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was exposed to an earthquake by 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned the lesson learned last season, when the team was defeated in the game of the Monaco Champions League, and he remains eager to bring the club to victory in the Cupup of the champions.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger noticed.
Arsenal has never done this before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm an intern.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us the serious lessons of male friendship
The lack of such stories appears, especially when it comes to the desperate need for men to be frank, now more than ever, while the suicide rate among young men is at the peak of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the single biggest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, with men being three times more likely than women.
In an effort to understand the issue of “Crafting Against Injury”, 2015 declared the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression found that if a patient has enough friends "in normal mood", the chances of healing are doubled.
Similarly, those who are not depressed may find that the circle of friends of the heart reduces the likelihood of emotional disorders twice.
But of course, for friendship to work, it's essential that it be.
At a time when communications are managed by social networks, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often more valuable than meaningful communication.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving and successful, even if the reality is loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our domestic aspirations for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And, as a billionaire recently observed, the creator of video games, you don't actually buy any more happiness with money.
Friends' dignity is that they're drawing attention to it.
Each individual was identified, not through his own work, but rather by the identity he had shown in his dealings with his friends.
Jumor Joey and Chandler's constant embrace, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's breath on Rachel -- everything comes from the understanding that men can feel this, even if they often refrain from a complete study of their feelings.
As the staff member told me, "My role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicideal moods emphasizes how even the smallest communication of friends can be of benefit."
Often, the men who approach us feel unable to speak to our friends.
The old teaching of living with it is as strong as the feeling that a frank discussion of problems can be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to propose longer-term mechanisms to overcome.
It underlined the subtle moments of men's friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of outsiders on the phone helps people at a time of despair, while long-term support comes from a close family and friends.
So, if you go to the CreditsFest in the Comedy Central this weekend, where for this holiday, they completely reconstituted the decorations, why don't you take your friends for a drink at Central Park.
Or, better still, if you see a single person in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
Do not lose sight of the benefits that friendship can bring.

De Maria kills her naked by helping her "PW" break the Malmoe.
Ankel de Maria, on the same basis as Blaise Matuidi and Edison Kavani, celebrate the broken balls at the Malmö gate.
Ankel de Maria, debuting in the League of Champions, killed a goal that allowed the SPM to easily bypass the Malmoux on Tuesday.
Here's the report on the match and the response to the game.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Kavani did their case when Parry Saint-Jerman started his game in the League of Champions with a very comfortable victory of 2:0 versus Malmoe at Park de Prince's stadium on Tuesday.
De Maria shot a ball less than four minutes after her first League Champion game started as a "JW" player to send champions of France, but they missed out on a number of possibilities before finally increasing their advantage when Kavani hit a goal for 61 minutes.
Along with Real Madrid and the Donetchter in Group A, the Parry had to get a good start against the championships of Sweden because they were focused not on the skills of the play-off but on the continuation of the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the fourths.
They earned points, but at the same time it wasn't the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to think Zlatan Ibrahimovic was useless in an attack and later replace him in a field against a team from his hometown and club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win a house or a party in the League of Champions, so it's going to win with number two, get the competitions into trouble and play a great role in the defense, it's a good start, even if there are more moments that we'll have to work out during the season," Blan said.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, even though I regret that we didn't hit one or two more balls.
Ibragimović returned after the trauma of one of the replacements on the Paris team, bringing her a nanny with an account of 2:2 in the Bordo match in the First League on the weekend, but he was set aside for the background plan of De Maria for the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker noted it as a player capable of bringing "PW" to a new level in Europe after it was bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran out to the road from Marco Verratty behind the edit "Malmo" and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Villand to the far corner of the gate.
But if someone was expecting a light and big victory then, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who won the Celtique in the play-off to reach this stage, with nine world-level players on a field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two backed-up paratroopers in the middle of the field, was a serious opposer.
But with the exception of the blow of Nicolas Juddžić, when the ball flew past the far trousers at the 34th minute of Kevin Trapp's gate, they attacked very little.
But, then, SGT has sometimes been misdirected by ultimatum transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, which only in the first half failed to make at least five attempts, and then failed to process the ball killed by Kavani immediately after the game was resumed.
Nevertheless, he showed himself to be much more adept in the proper pastures, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, who received the ball, De Maria, by a mangered blower, which passed the 52-minute rye to the pants of the Vivland.
The second leg was finally beaten after an hour's notice thanks to Kavan, and the Uruguayan shot down his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimimović had set up the ball sent to the centre of the field with the left flank Maxwell.
This put an end to all the ideas that Malmö had about going back into the game, and only the interception of the Viland ball from a very close distance prevented David Luis from increasing the final account before the replacement of Escel Lavus.
"Malme" Age Haridee later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, and Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions was held last December."
Since then, we've only played the Swedish league, which is not the level.
The qualifications are not enough.
Glorious "Pare"!
It was a great match with them.
Glencure earns $2.5 billion for shares
Switzerland ' s mining and trading giant Glencor, affected by the decline in commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion for the sale of shares as part of his ambitious debt reduction plan.
The London Stock Exchange company Glencor made a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value, was trying to cope with the collapse of commodity prices while China ' s economy was undermining demand and causing chaos in world markets.
As a result of the release of new shares at a concessionary price, the Glencor equity rate on the London Stock Exchange took off in early morning bidding on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 for FTSE 100, which was traded 0.69 per cent higher at the opening.
Glencure started sales of $2.5 billion last week as part of extensive plans to reduce his 30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold new shares of 125 cents apiece, or 2.4 percent a discount price when closing the tender on Tuesday.
It has placed 1.3 billion new shares, representing 9.99 per cent of the company ' s statutory capital.
Fear of the continuation of the recession in the Chinese economy caused the cost of iron ore to drop by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials fell by 20 to 40 per cent.
White House confirms Si Jinpin's visit to Washington, D.C.
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official communication that the head of China, Sea Jinpin, would arrive at the United States late this month.
The visit, the first visit by Ci Tinpin to Washington, will take place on 25 September and will be a return visit to the arrival of President Barack Obama in Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and the First Lady of the United States, Michel Obama, will also receive Si Jinpin with Pen Liuang's wife at a government dinner the same night after two leaders are engaged in bilateral negotiations.
“President Si Jinpin's visit will provide an opportunity to enhance US-China cooperation on general, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and also to allow the Presidents of the United States and China to address the controversial issues constructively”, the communication states.
Ci Jinpin, whose first visit was announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle for a meeting with the leaders of several major American technology companies on their way to Washington, D.C., and then to travel to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Si Jinginh are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington ' s concerns about China ' s alleged cyberspionage and China ' s increased cataegogy regarding the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
The first killer on Kutuzov Disaster received two years of colony.
In addition, the court granted the victims ' civil claims in the amount of 1.2 million roubles to Denis Mirzouv.
The Moscow Road Court handed down the verdict of Denis Mirzouv, who killed a motorcycleist on the Kutuzov Avenue in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years in prison in the settlement colony.
It is found guilty under the article “Breaching the traffic rules and operating the vehicles” of the Criminal Code.
In addition, the Court partially granted the victims ' civil claims in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
During the debate of the parties, the prosecutor requested that Mirzoeva be sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and that he file full claims with the victims of 8 million roubles.
The accident in question took place on 22 May at about three o'clock in the vicinity of 30 Kutuzov Avenue.
The BMW vehicle, led by Mirzoev, crossed a side lane and hit a motorcycle rider on the side of the road.
The man died on the ground from the injuries he received from his birth in 1989.
Friends of a person who had died in social networks reported that the driver of the BMW was driving at high speed and before the accident was hit by a lane.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape his responsibility, the bikers arranged a motor vehicle from the Wyrobei Mountains to the Moscow HUMVD building on Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it became known that the investigation delayed the alleged accident perpetrator.
In Moscow a naked man who had fallen into the temple was detained.
He was calm and did not commit any unlawful acts, and the police handed him over to the doctors for emergency psychiatric care.
The capital police detained a Moscowian who entered one of the temples without clothing.
This is reported by Moscow.
As Andrey Galicaberov, the head of the MoU press service for Moscow, reported that the incident took place on Tuesday, 15 September, around 1600, on the Kassir highway.
Nikolai’s temple was attended by a naked man.
He was calm and did not commit any unlawful acts.
A police commissary arrived on call.
The law enforcement officers waited on the doctors from the Emergency Psychiatric Brigade and handed them over to the man.
A 26-year-old resident of Moscow fell to them.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakušev.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakishev, at a meeting of the Bureau of the Regional Government.
A part of them concerned the allocation of funds to educational and health facilities in the municipal areas.
In particular, funds are being provided for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in the Bajatavdin district, and for the major maintenance of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major repair of the second floor of the therapeutic office.
The hot and cold water, water supply, electrical grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, the construction of the building, renovation of the premises, fire safety and energy conservation activities will be repaired.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On 17-18 September, a second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, in which the Tumen delegation will participate, headed by the Governor.
The forthcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcome of the cooperation is described by the honorary Consulate General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumena Vladimir Schul, a member of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorović, what are the tasks of the Sochi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, an important link between the two States.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenka, are scheduled to participate in the plenary session.
The plenary and breakout sessions will focus on the experiences of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policies, regulations and programmes of the Union State.
The Governor of Tumen will speak.
I think that is evidence of successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of line ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will work.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new, profitable contracts and agreements.
I'm adding that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
Over two hundred delegates participated, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At that time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumen and the Minsk provinces had been signed.
The importance of our work is also reflected in the fact that a meeting of the ongoing seminar was held in Tumen at the parliamentary meeting of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
APC delegation to the Tumen region also visited the Republic of Belarus to learn the experience of Belarusians in training agricultural personnel, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial sector.
You've recently met with the head of the region and head of city administration.
What topics were discussed?
At a meeting with the Governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakušev, the region was working with the Republic of Belarus in today ' s difficult conditions.
The supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and financial mechanisms will be a matter of concern - they are needed to reduce the cost of machinery for the final consumer.
Problems were discussed in the Tumen's Belshain Trade House and the options for preventing loss.
Questions are important, as investment projects must work clearly and bring profit to the region.
Reference was made to the further supply of passenger and cargo equipment to the MoMA, the development of the MoU service centre, which was established in Tumen at the TUA TUTAP.
The discussion also touched on the preparation of a visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the year.
Another subject of discussion was the finalization and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamic of relationships promises to move to a new level.
These matters concerned the regional centre.
During a meeting with the chief of administration of the town of Tumeni, Alexander Moor, we were talking about the renewal of the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses already drive into the incense, so a new shipment of cars from Belarus is required to work on gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect is that the Tumen elevator plant is cooperating with one of the leading producers of the OA 'Mogillyftash' by receiving the assembly products.
In my opinion, these activities could become more active, given the programme to install new elevators at the regional centre.
I am adding that within the framework of the expanded powers, the Consulate met with the Governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Cochin, during which the issue of the expansion of trade and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment was discussed in Zaroural.
A meeting with the Oma Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The extended consular region is composed of five FM entities, but Tumen is known as the district headquarters.
The region is a platform for many promising projects, including an honorary gene.
Generally speaking, such meetings are meaningful and good, allowing for the immediate and speedy resolution of many problems, denouncing them and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current circumstances, it is essential not to break the gap by continuing to work ahead.
Matt Damon against focusing on ethnic diversity in film production
Matt Damon argued with Effy Brown's Aphro-American producer, saying behind the bullets that no ethnic composition was necessary.
During the Sunday show Project Greenlight on HBO channel, a famous actor interrupted Brown while trying to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroin in the script selected for the project.
"Multiculturality is appropriate when you give tapes for the film itself, not for the show," insisted Damon.
Charming Brown, not believing her ears, said "Wow, that's not the way it is, it's all the time an actor from Martian made comments on live air.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Daimon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Afflec and Farelli's brothers.
"I'd like the participants -- it doesn't matter who the director is -- to think about the treatment of the Harmon's image they're going to take," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who gets hit by a white pimp.
A film producer, Fear White Pistle, advocated that Leo Angelos and Christian Brancacho become filmmakers; Damon was strongly opposed to saying, "In the end, we can get the wrong thing we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social networks blew up in disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni spoke angry about a video presentation, explaining the diversity of Matt Damon's only black man in THOTO BELE, which is painful.
Twitter got more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "bulbs."
Damon's sayings appear just when the literacy of the racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After Michael Brown, a teenager, was shot dead by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement became popular throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colour population.
In February, Prince, a singer, mentioned this movement at the time of presenting applicants for the Almous year modification of the Gramy Awards.
"Aloms are still important," he said.
As books and lives of blacks, albums still matter.
Recently, Black Lives Matter leaders released an official statement in response to a question from Fox News staff member Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be seen as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," said the leaders of the movement.
It was recently announced that Damon was included on the list of show business figures, producers and media magnets invited to visit Pope Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with the Pope is unknown.
American Ninja Warrior pays the first champion
The professional scallop and assistant waiter Isaac Kaldioro on Monday night became the first winner of American Ninja Warrior's show to take home $1 million.
On this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, no participants have yet been able to go through all the stages of the route with obstacles.
In the finals of the season, two of the participants -- Caldiero and Jeff Britten's operator -- went to the final round.
The final task was to climb 75 feet long in 30 seconds along a rope.
Britten did the task first and did the job at the given time, becoming the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warior, who had spent the exhausting stage 4, but Kaldio did it three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After a victory with incredible difficulty, Kaldiero, who was shocked by the fact that he had won a million dollars, gave an interview with E! News.
"I've never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year to think of this," commented Isaac to journalists E, with such a serious leap of income.
And all of a sudden, I never even imagined what it would be like... the future is unknown.
The Hollywood Reporter, executive producer Kent Wied, met with journalists to talk about the finals and why Britten, who was the first to pass the route, won't get any cash.
According to the rules, the money is received by the fastest participant.
"If the topping players are more than one, they'll get the fastest of them," Ued said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes lives, it is still very satisfying.
I don't think he's feeling hurt about it.
He's happy about what he did.
He's got tons of excited calls from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his kids and his wife.
Jeff told me, "if I was told to lose somebody, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if we had changed roles.
"Americana Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will start filming in the spring of 2016.
"Derot Tigers" quietly bypass "Minnesso Twins"
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for The Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers, is now at the American League's central December.
It's just to be a mistake, the Tigers won the bluff on Tuesday at the Minnesota Towers with a turn of 5-4 on the Trade Field.
Twins missed the opportunity to cut half-game gap between Houston Astros and take the second seat in the play-off game by points after the winners.
For the detriots, even for one night, it was a return of the word to the letter F, which had fled most of the second half of the season.
"All winning is fun, no matter how much they get," said Brad Osmus' manager.
The pilot, Alfredo Simon, made a contribution to support the attack, bringing Detroit to three points in the first two innings and then adding another in the sixth and the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a player in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third qualitative start in nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good indicators," said Simon.
The pirates can't get thrown into every game, so I want to get deeper into the game.
Viktor Martinez, the designated "Tigers", was able to beat down three strokes and scored two wounds -- the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strokes from four strokes to a game against Sittle Mariners on July 6th.
"He worked well with the bat," said Osmus.
He well showed himself in (the use of a Bethel), with a marked improvement in the work of a bat, and he maintained this quality for the game.
Took three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance to get back to the game.
Central host Buckston opened inning with a div on the left-hand line of the field.
Raitfield Aaron Hicks, making a cant, took the first base, and the second bioman, Brian Dozier, received a strike-out from Simon before his left-hand Blaine Hardy took his seat.
Hardy passed the Moera, the only player on the road, before Miguel Sano's newly appointed reflectionist who shot two-hour blue to the left of the right-winged Drew Verhagen.
At a couple of Ranners not in the aut and comparing wound at the second Ver Hagen base, Trevor Pluff's third beysman was able to be hit by the loins.
It was the 27th time for the leading high league player in this season, when Ploff hit the ball on the drive-by.
After Detroit added a subservient wound in the first half of the Ninth Inning, he earned RBI "apple" into space between the autfields against Bruce Rhondon's closing player, with an account of 5-4.
However, the right-wing player had beaten Sano after three strikes and had received his fifth story.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily unpracticed Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved patient who had been on the trauma list up to the game, missing more than a month due to the falling of the luminary.
"Of course not the start I'd like," said Hughes, "but as the game grew, I felt more comfortable, and so I was able to do some pretty good bits in the third insulin."
After the first Bethel arrived at the first base, Hughes threw the single to Ian Kinsler's second best name.
A duck at two Piedgfield J. D. Martinez took Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his zero-for-21 series with morningners in an effective position.
The third base player, Nick Castelianos, followed the single by another wound, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to get closer to the third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the account in second inning, receiving a one-day "dwell" from a kettler by James McConn and a two-foot blue by the central reflector Anthony Gouz, and the day-to-day became 3-0.
"It was a tough thing," said the manager, "Tuins" Paul Monitor.
He wasn't particularly good, but he fell right into the right spot.
Hughes, who was believed to have dropped his brow in the unloaded mark of the third insulin, was replaced by a right-wing revolver, A. J. Ahter.
His count was three wounds per six hits and his eye was four shots.
NOTES: Anibial Sánchez, a pilot right-wing player, has been out of play in connection with the extension of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed an operation on Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the trauma list since mid-August, is scheduled to leave on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, Daniel Norris, the left-leaner, will leave the list of the wounded and turn against the Twins.
Norris, who left the Tigers at four startings from the moment he was purchased in exchange for David Price's flat-heads on July 30, has one victory and one defeat.
He has not participated in the games since 20 August because of the spraining of the cosmos.
The Tigers and Twins will conclude a series of three games on Wednesday.
The opposite of Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be played by Herbine Santana's father-in-law (5-4, ERA 4.73).
Found Kadyrov's complaints on the book Molba to God before the South Sakhalin Court.
In the Southern Sakhalin City Court, the representative of President Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov submitted the original appeal to the Court for recognition of “extrast” in the book “Molba to God: Its Importance and Place in Islam”, with reference to the President of the Alexander Churay.
The court will now await possible objections from the participants in the trial.
The Chuhrai refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the State Committee of the Russian Federation that it was necessary to test the bitter for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such foolishness," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sahel City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natali Perčenko to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
The Public Prosecutor's Office of South Sakhalinska received an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor considers that they have asked the court to consider only the author ' s opinion, not the Koran ' s.
In the view of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision," said Chuhrai.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was adopted on 12 August 2015.
In particular, the words of the Koran are "We worship you and we pray for your help" and "Do not call on anyone with Allah."
Kadyrov called the decision-makers on the book "chaytans and pro-opocts."
He called upon the State Committees to prohibit by law judicial decisions concerning the texts of sacred writings.
“I strongly believe that the State should adopt a law prohibiting judicial decisions relating to the explicit texts of the Koran and other Divine Scripture”, wrote Cadrov in his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intend to remove posts and comments that negatively assess migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints of unlawful content.
It is intended to combat xenophobia and racism through the Facebook network in conjunction with the Ministry of Justice of Germany.
Thus, the previous day, Haiko Maas, the head of the department, stated that the minister was working with social workers to establish a special group of modernists.
Its participants have a duty to follow up on and correct the comments of migrants and refugees that are not applicable to migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of non-perpetrative posts will receive notices indicating the reason for their removal.
Organizations whose experts collect complaints against abusive posts from users should also contribute to the operational closure of wrongful content.
The Facebook management intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative expressions against migrants and refugees, the management of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was taken after xenophobic moods had risen sharply in the German segment of Facebook.
One of their most obvious causes was the unprecedented migration crisis, which reached the European Union some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all refugee accommodation facilities are already overcrowded today.
On the previous day, the authorities had decided to temporarily settle migrants on the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Those forced to move from the Middle East and Africa are held in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were detained under the Nazi regime.
There will be areas for reclamation in Moscow's cemetery.
In the near future, several cavaliers are equipped with specialized reclamation areas and psychological recreation.
The first to be found were Butovsky, Domodowsky, and Szbbin’s cemetery.
The first room for psychological rest has already been established at the Troekurov cemetery in Moscow.
Such sites will be added to other parts of the city.
The portal was described by Artem Ekim, who is the head of the State Budget Institute “Ritual”.
Relax areas will represent small, green areas that resemble parks.
Experts believe that visitors to the cemetery can rest, be alone, and restore psychological strength in these corneres.
In the near future, the reflagging zones will be built in Domodowska, Butovsky and Szbilin cemeteryes, and later in other parts of the capital.
According to the head of the Ritaal, when it is necessary to expand the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing woodland areas to the maximum extent possible.
Green plants will serve as a living fence to separate rest areas and areas directly placed under burial sites.
The GU’s “Ritual” experts also stated their intention to propose a waiver of burial fences.
New cemeterys can really be barbarous.
In addition, at the GBR Ritual, there was a willingness to take up electronic terminals that would allow visitors to know GPS coordinates and plate numbers of graves.
In June of this year, the Ritual GBB also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services according to the time of the year.
Yes, red graves in summer would cost a thousand rubles cheaper, a week of winter, when the earth is frozen.
We will note that in the past year, an average of 10 per cent travel for all ritual services has been made.
After five days in the Hellenic woods, a lost fungus was found.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the woods without a glimpse.
Joint efforts by rescue and volunteer workers have been made to locate the mountain grave.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent, "The 79-year-old retiree from Tambow oblast has spent five days in the forest."
No food and no water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even quinologists with dogs, but there was no outcome.
The man was found after the helicopter engaged in the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as he usually went to the forest to get water and backup, did not return by the evening.
The families immediately sought help, and the next day rescue workers and the inequitable residents from the neighboring village were raised to search for the fungus, only about 30 persons.
A helicopter from the fire and rescue centre joined them for the fifth day.
Andrey Seletkov, the chief of the search and rescue team at the Smolensk Fire and Rescue Centre, said, "Werlet was engaged, the man was discovered."
He's gone very far, completely elsewhere.
It was about 12 kilometres from the search site.
He's gone a long way at his age.
A miracle is still alive.
The Grybnik was taken to the Hellenine central district hospital without consciousness, in extremely difficult condition.
Medical researchers diagnosed his pneumonia as well as severe deoxygenation and cooling of the body.
As an elderly man was able to survive five days in the forest, doctors do not represent him.
Valentina Nepsha, head of an elonginian therapeutic unit, says, "A patient's examination, a treatment has been commissioned."
Infused therapy, antibacterial.
Because of all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition had improved in the morning, but it's still hard, but it's very positive.
Vitay Alexandrovich, retired, comes to Smolenjuna from Tambowsk every year.
His grandson says Grandpa's still going to pick mushrooms, but he's never gone down into the woods.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the fungus found, said, "Les near the road, not in principle local."
Roughly for several years, I traveled to visit my family.
So I followed the mushrooms.
Apparently he went a long way and got lost.
Since the start of the mushroom season, people have been regularly lost in all parts of the Smolin region.
In the last few days alone, five similar cases.
Rescuers remind us that we have to walk in the woods in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches, and compasses.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces so that they can come back.
Emergency An-2 sat on a puncture in fraternal taiga.
In Siberia, emergency An-2 sat right in the channel.
An emergency landing of an air force from the Red Air Force, Enise, took place 68 kilometres from Braska.
There were no casualties and casualties, but the aircraft itself suffered significant damage at landing.
An-2 made the service flight.
There were three crew members on board, the commander, the second pilot and the manned man, reporting the Interfax.
The aircraft took over the Railway-Ilimsk-Achinsk route, where the airline is based.
The plane crew has already arrived in Bratsk.
The Military Transport Procurator's Office, following an emergency landing of An-2, began to verify compliance with air safety legislation.
An investigation team of the East Siberia Transport Prosecutor ' s Office left at the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, the Tou-154 crew landed its passenger aircraft due to a technical failure at the Komi abandoned cargo airport.
Engines and electronics were refused on the liner, but the crew did not do the impossible.
The aircraft was carried by 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No casualties occurred during the emergency landing.
Venue Economics à Nobel laureate: Globalization
The globalization processes should have helped to reduce the world ' s inequalities.
In fact, the situation does not seem to be the same, but the income gap in developing economies is growing.
Eric Muskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to Eric Muskin, Chief Research Officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choices of the NISE, the Nobel Prize laureate in the Economics of 2007.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Globalists predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true," says Maskine.
China and India, for example, have experienced a serious increase in per capita GDP.
But it's not that happy.
Globalization was expected to narrow the gap between “indigent” and “indigent” in poor countries, which is reflected in the large income inequality and, more precisely, in pay.
But, in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Muskin in his article “Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequality in Developing Economy”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, carried over and quoted by NEES.
Together with the economist, Professor Michael Cremer, of Harvard University, Eric Muskin, developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income differentials are increasing in poor countries as globalization grows, resembles SWEE.
In the new global market, specific processes are taking place.
To illustrate them, Muskin provides four professional levels - A and B for rich countries, C and D for the poor.
Following globalization, experts in D from poor countries lack skills to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if employees at the level C of poor countries have a wage increase as a result of cooperation with B of the rich, D growth does not feel or their wages fall at all.
The resulting effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to widening the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, accordingly, to increasing inequality.
The Kremer and E. are offered an amazingly beautiful model, alternative to the Riardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fouad Alscowrov, an official professor who leads the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions, the head of the Department of Mathematics of WSWI.
And as a powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge in empirical work in this field.
The solution is, according to Eric Muskina, to increase the level of the generation of low-skilled workers.
However, employees themselves, according to a scientist, do not have the means to do so and companies do not benefit from paying for their training.
In such a situation, Governments, international agencies, NCCs and private foundations have a significant role to play.
He noted that the theory developed in no way called for a halt to the process of globalization, which had brought and produced its fruits in the form of the growth of the GDP of countries.

Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, notes its 2,000th birthday in September.
In the celebration event, the Festival of National Cultures of Dagestan and the past-time fair, the Exhibition of the Dorber carpets and the Open Temple Day, the 2,000-hour historical and musical show and a tour of the reconstructed Museum of Peter I.
The medieval stones of Naryn-Kala, the old Arabic inscriptions on the walls, the narrow streets and the palaces, all seem to have come off the pages of "Stocks and Night".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been preserved since ancient times.
Although he was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Hazar’s Cathada, and the Golden Order.
The age of the eastern plateau, which grows in the courtyard of the Djuma macheta, is several centuries.
These powerful plants are protected by the All-Russia Programme "The Trees of Nature".
A shadow of scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during summer heat.
A mosque will pour out a aromatic tea and comfort the Daguestan lacoma -- honey figs, furs, musulas, kneads, masquerades, and airanas and sweets.
In Derbent, the sparks of the ages are used with large squabbles to hang many guests at one time.
The inscription on the Juma meeting entrance says that the building was built in 115 Highlands.
So in 733, it's on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking and solemn: the arches of the bathers and the convoys are based on square columns and are covered by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is the traditional involvement of Derbent's residents.
Homebird owners place pigeons in their courtyards, under the trees, on their pinions.
A spectacular sight will take up a hundred white pigeons in the sky, similar to the flashes of a holiday fireworks.
For defence purposes, the Persians closed the Caspian Gate of the double stone wall.
Going 500 meters into the sea, this building has blocked Derbent’s harbors.
In 2003, the strong walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well-established monument to the ancient Orthodox fortification.
The carpets in Darbant were still in the fifth century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the city’s markets, carpets are sold on any taste - hair trousers, cotton, or bellies of all flowers and hues, with a gate and no one’s or other, with complex designs and fads.
The construction of the city began with single - story stone blocks.
In years and years, the bulls have remained virtually unchanged.
Only satellite plates, conditioners on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in the medieval, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, there were still parts of the plumbing built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
Ancient sources of water have reached our time.
Many dberbers prefer conventional water from taps of tested historical fountains.

The former Virgin Bane has a museum today called Culture and the Ancient Derbenta.
In the past, unmarried girls and brides accompanied a friend, and now anyone who wants to see a cosmopolitan room, a hot and cold pool that has gone past bathing supplies.
Most Derbent's houses have hot water, but the baths and pairs are as popular today as they were in times past.
The benefits of heating the organism are written in ancient books.
After the baths improve blood, the muscles lose fatigue, and the body becomes flexible and light.
The Commonwealth, which runs in Naryn Cala, is a festival of ethnic sub-divisions in many areas of Dagerstan.

Domodedod has had a business game at the airport.
A new form of education is being offered in the capital city.
Four hundred students tried to be airport officials.
To that end, three airfares were mounted in Domodow.
Not only did young people inspect and register passengers but they also served airplanes.
All of this is in the form of business games, but it has not, in many cases, given its reality.
The two passengers, who had been on their way back to the plane, lost their flight.
The real airport is Hell.
The one based in Domodov's hangar is a standard set of tasks to be solved by newcomers.
In one hangar, three large airports from all over the world took their seats.
They now have four hundred students from capital colleges and colleges.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the internal world of aircraft.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, luggage were entrusted even to buses in the flight field, stairs and passengers' inspection.
And the passengers, they're messing with them.
One has a document disorder, another gets late on the flight, and the third fills the bag with suspicious objects.
And we need to deal with all of this in a time frame like life.
For each of these tasks, they have a certain amount of money, virtual money, as if they had been paid by the airline to service the flight.
“In order to fail, a fine is imposed on them”, explains a interview of the Vesti-Moscow financial analyst Demetry Hilco.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely following these events.
For them this examination is an attempt to test a new form of study.
She's already been promoted in secondary vocational education.
“The six interregional centres of competence will be established, which will in fact become new models of the work of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment,” says the director of the Department of Public Policy in the area of training workers and additional vocational training in the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation.
But students aren't on global agendas.
After three days of training, they seem to need a weekend.
At the same time, the evaluation of the examination was quite material.

The United States Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia deplored the closure of the Foreign Literature Library of the United States Centre.
The Centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The United States Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the United States Embassy Centre at the All-Russian State Library in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken recently by the Russian Federation call into question the Russian Government's commitment to relations between Russian and American peoples that have not been interrupted even during the cold war and in other difficult moments in the long history of our countries”, says Ambassador John Tofft of the United States in Interfax.
The American Centre has established deep and lasting links between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
He was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and served as the venue for meetings with numerous American prominent figures, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, academics, politicians and writers.
"Just last year, the American Centre held more than 400 cultural and educational events and hosted more than 50,000 Russian visitors," stressed the diplomat.
Tofft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Educational Exchange Programme.
The Green Tribunal was quickly executed.
Typical situation: The four officials are in front of Judge Svatanter Kumar's desk, hearing his claims for work done.
The Court is completely not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to be comforted by it.
If there's one more brick, we're gonna have to tear down all the available building materials.
The Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial body established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution of the environment, which is accompanied by the violent economic growth of recent decades.
During this period, the Tribunal has considered more than 10,000 claims involving air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the construction that leads to the contamination.
The rates are enormously high: India has become one of the most populated and polluted countries in the 60-year period since the declaration of the independence of enhanced industrial development.
The problem is particularly acute in large megapoliss, where infrastructure development does not move towards rapid urbanization: cities are covered with a heavy capacity, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few of the remaining housing areas are being built into new residential areas.
Despite the State ' s formal support for the green movement, the NZT has been regularly criticized by the Government of Nerendra Modi, as often becomes the main reason for the elimination of the largest investment projects.
Thus, in May of this year, the Minister of Environment referred to the court's decisions as “extreme” and “unimplementable”.
Sometimes the court ' s decisions cannot be met in the court ' s setting, confirming environmental counsel Raj Panjwani.
However, the non-executive dividends also have a positive side: at least they force the responsible to move.
"It's his main goal to make this system work," adds counsel.
The Green Tribunal has, on several occasions, cancelled major constructions, with the end of airport construction, power plants and hundreds of smaller facilities.
However, people also try to keep in mind, for example, when discussing the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagan State, which polluted a local fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we're responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," commented Kumar.
However, such explanations are far from always understood by ordinary people, whose lives may change by means of one relic of a judge’s transition.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles above 10 years of age from entering the capital, as was the result of popular resentment.
Despite the dramatic decline in popularity and criticism, Satan Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered the New Delhi Government to provide statistics on the motor vehicle, as well as to purchase 10,000 additional buses, prior to learning from factories whether they were in a position to comply with such an order.
As sources of pollution, such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents, began to enter into the attention of the ship, popular anger began to calm down.
But the most painful subject of a principled judge is the Ganges River Clean-up Programme, which was sponsored by Prime Minister Narandroy Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a river sacred to the Hindus, the judge often stops controlling his emotions and turns to shouting.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from Ganga into the statue of God, and there were feces in it, and the judge was on fire.
You keep polluting the river because you think Gang is the Ganges, he'll take away all our sins.
It is a river that we worship, and see what you do to it every day.
The cleaning of Ganga is the most ambitious and costly environmental project sponsored by the new Government.
At present, the number of fecal bacteria in the river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Every year, between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million Hindus who buy it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money from the sale of his suit to the Saving Ganga Foundation, where he met Barak Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists accused the queen of populism: the suit was purchased for $700,000, while the river treatment required at least eight billion.
The supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the price of progress should be green.
"In a developing country, talk about the environment is often perceived as just a luxury," says Malik Bhanot, an activist of the Ganges News.
And the court is trying to find a gold middle between environment and development."
The man's bleeding some of Dalli's paintings at the Riga Exhibition.
A visitor to the Exhibition of the Latvian Union of Arts in Riga broke windows in a museum and ruined El Salvador's sculpture entitled The Origin of an Angel.
An exposition of El Salvador Dalí and Pablo Picasso is now taking place at the museum.
The man, born in 1985, entered the sculpture hall at 2:20 p.m.
Right away, he did the wrong thing, ruined the sculpture, broke the windows.
He then began to move around the room and overshadowed some permanent exposure work.
Among them are the portrait of Porca of the Caste of Meervalides Polis.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Arts, Igor Dobchin, referred to by Interfax, is also damaged.

C. Jinpin calls for making the economy more open to peace
The economy must become more open to the world to accelerate its growth, as President Si Jinping said on Tuesday in addressing the task of managing the reforms.
“China should concentrate on attracting foreign investors and experts and promoting a policy of openness”, he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Chief Reform Team.
He said that expanding openness and deepening reforms would give the economy new impetus and strength and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group has adopted a number of directives, including on regulating investor access to the market, changing border controls, promoting public enterprises (SOE) that attract private capital and revising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of economy and of production inaccessible to investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually re-locked through pilot programmes.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more significant role in the allocation of resources, the rule of law in the business sector and the promotion of openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken its control over the authority vested in companies, thus guaranteeing that the companies themselves will run their own businesses.
The statement also states that China will allow the border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for strengthening local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors to increase the openness of publicly owned sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign financing, as well as provide them with better conditions”, the statement states.
The procedure for applying for permanent residence permits for foreigners, or the Green Card, will be further facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the actual application process.
The meeting also discussed the promotion of the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to an official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Lee Keazan and Ministers Liu Yongshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended.
