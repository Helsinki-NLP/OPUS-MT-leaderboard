Republican strategy for resistance to Obama ' s re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policy by the need to combat the falsification of elections.
At the Brennan Centre, however, the latter myth is considered, claiming that the falsifications of elections in the United States are more rare than deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers have estimated only 300 cases of electoral falsification in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on the voter situation.
In this sense, the system of American democracy is partly discredited.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state Governments have enacted laws since 2009 complicating the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon gained new momentum following the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the republics in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were passed limiting voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require the elector to produce a photo identification and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early balloting, abolish the voter registration on the day of expression, and deny the right to vote to citizens having the right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no American state obliged voters to file a photo identity card.
Indiana was the first State to make such a request.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian Act.
The Republic authorities have hurried to extend the practice to other states.
During the past two years, they have initiated draft laws that require voters to file photo identity cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have the same universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, or 21 million of them who have attained the age required to vote, do not have a photograph taken by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
However, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African-Americans, 15 per cent of people making less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required personal identification.
But that's not all.
Voter students who are considered to be voting for candidates from democracies are not allowed to use a photograph of their educational institution in several states.
At the same time, the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly for Republicans to use the certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required proof of American citizenship to vote.
This was first introduced into Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latin American nationals.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are said to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the republican legislators introduced laws in 2011 to abolish voter registration on the day of voting in eight states.
They have also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
That was not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a drop of 17 per cent in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, 33 per cent of early voters in Florida were African Americans during the 2008 general elections, although the latter accounted for only 13 per cent of the state voters.
The same thing happened to Latin American people.
Only 11 per cent of voters represented 24 per cent of those who voted early.
Unlike the whites, who formed 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the voters voted.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly oppose the enactment of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws have been enacted by Democratic Governors.
The most controversial laws have been suspended with the intervention of the Attorney General of the United States.
This made it possible to limit in part the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have enacted laws requiring the production of photo-sensitive identity cards.
Nevertheless, the new rules, which had entered into force, would undoubtedly impede the exercise of the electoral right in the 2012 elections.
Critics from democracies condemn the bias of laws that have been enacted, with a clear focus on influencing the 2012 elections in key states.
The Brennan Centre ' s 2011 report shows that the States that have enacted these laws represent 171 out of the 270 votes required for the Brennan panel to win the presidential elections.
It is too early to conclude with confidence that these electoral legislative changes will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the voter appearance.
In this sense, the system of American democracy is partly discredited.
Precise cancer screening: a test or not?
In fact, the PAA test sometimes gives wrong results, false, sometimes false, which lead to useless medical interventions.
Both men and those who are reluctant to carry on the work are even more embarrassed.
Do you have a test or not?
We asked the opinion of the two specialists.
Studies in the United States have seen numerous cases of infection among groups of researchers, and it is difficult to interpret the data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates among patients and those who did not.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that metastasis was 30-40% higher for those who did not complete screening.
So, I'd recommend a test starting in 50 years, or 40 years if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also at increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is found.
The cancer can be both aggressive and powerful.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer by offering him options, without mandatory prostate cancer treatment, which does not pose a life risk in the long run, but in choosing, in such cases, to actively monitor the disease.
To date, many men diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is neither aggressive nor life threatening.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
We increasingly define with accuracy the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I'd recommend we do a test.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether a test is necessary or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Association, Mowiemberg has developed a tool to assess all over and against the PSA test.

Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people had a healthy diet and were to move enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"Had no one smoked any more, this figure would have increased to at least 50%," says André Bolje, secretary of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are inherited.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Cancer Association of Canada, tobacco control remains a priority, despite fewer smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85 per cent of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It has caused enormous harm to human health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says Spokesperson André Bolle.
A promising fact is that 10 years after smoking is eliminated, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weights
According to KAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat and direct intestines, food, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"The studies show that regular physical activity over the course of life protects single intestine cancer", adding to the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends that the use of red meat be restricted.
Too large, it increases the risk of gut cancer.
Collision products should also be avoided.
The conservation of meat by digging, drying or salinity may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can cause harm to body cells and lead to cancer," explained the Association.
Vitamines
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies are not unambiguous.
SCC considered vitamin E research to be counterproductive.
If one showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other produced the opposite result.
In the assessment of the impact on the development of vitamin D cancer, it is also not clear.
Mr. Bolho stressed, however, that it was important to discuss its concerns and family anaesthesia with a doctor.
"Assistance does not lead to cancer."
Boson Higgs in detail
In the past summer, reports that scientists may have discovered the Higgs Boson have caused real diversion and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
Moreover, it is the last particle, the existence of which was predicted in the Standard Model, our best, or, in any case, the “name of imperfect” description of the nature and conduct of the mother, but which had not previously been identified by a practical way.
But physics is not yet fully convinced that it is the Higgs Boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it is much like the Higgs Boson, predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at one major physical convention in Kyoto appears to confirm this, although some data are not yet available to be fully reliable.
But let's imagine it's about the Higgs Boson, because the chances of making mistakes seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is one law in this world that's completely inevitable, saying that two things can't go to the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, not even try too hard, or hurt yourself.
But while basic particle physics is strange to the world, it also reveals that there is one law of the same nature: the principle of the exclusion of Paula, which suggests that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same “quanal state” -- these are, in general terms, some of their characteristics.
The physics therefore divides the particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good- humored citizens called farms who wisely adhere to Paula’s principle.
The other is the bosons, an evil gang of anarchists, who have no respect for at least this principle, which means that they may find themselves in the same place at the same time.
According to the website (a totally unexplained) Particle Adventure Laboratory of Burkly, these bosons are divided into two groups: the Mesons that we're not talking about, and the “parts of force” through which the main forces of nature are distributed and which some of them are the Higgs Boson.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all exotic beings, as might be thought.
In fact, if you're able to read this chronica, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: the photona, or part of the light, which is the “survivor” of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with electrical charge accelerates or changes its direction, it breaks the electromagnetic field at this particular location, like a rock thrown into the pond.
This “violation” produces an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) and is nothing more than a photonic wave - and hence one of the bosons of the “power carriers”.
A more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs Boson, just the difference that to make this boson appear, the field of Higgs must be broken.
The Higgs field, however, is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to build it, it has to be driven by a very high amount of energy, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface could only shake a very large rock.
That's why a huge particle acceleration is needed, like the one that operates in CERN, the Big Adronal Collider, which is a 27-kilometre ring!, to achieve such enormous energy.
Analogia with electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs Boson and the mass.
Not all particles and materials actually interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stay on the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have a mass, whereas others (like photon, by the way) do not have a mass.
So, what can all of these studies bring, asks Ms. Plamond?
In science, they are used to check that the Standard Model (MS) is correct, and this also makes it possible for physicists to make a difference between the results of SM observations and projections.
In addition, some of them are eager to find such a gap, i.e. the slightest discrepancy can open the door to the new physics and shut down some of the Model's holes.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant flaws without any explanation for gravity (ow!) or dark matter that makes up about 80% of the universe (wow!).
But as long as there are no differences in the CERN.
Effects
Benefiting from these studies for the everyday life of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See, early in the 1960s, a laser pioneer in Bella laboratories could not even predict what revolution their work would be going to be.
They saw their apparitions in science, but not more.
In fact, the already deceased physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser in 1962, said that the original laser was treated more like a "laboratory device".
Imagine...
In addition, an annex may be available for the tools accompanying the study.
For example, the same billion - dollar Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical studies in 1969.
This sensor, although not originally designed, has now served as a slide for all the world's digital cameras and has earned the 2009 Nobel Physical Prize.
This does not mean, of course, that the work of the Greater Hadron Collider is bound to change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Police aid is the best way to die.
The life - and - death commission in Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must resume soon, and a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
The Dolg tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Still lived alone in his apartment in Montserrat.
The prostate cancer, which destroyed him inside, gave him a two-year stay.
"I've been giving me five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor Gadba's palliative exit shelter in Belea, the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to get ready for it," he says.
An illness makes its work: an incredible weakness that prevents it from taking its own to the toilet and even from eating on its own.
While sitting at a table with an appetite for lunch, he surrenders and agrees to be helped to take food.
He is alert, even smiling, to talk to strangers who work around him, to bring him medication, and to take him to the bathroom.
Courage before normal death.
"My greatest wish to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"We've been taught through life that a man has to sleep a hundred," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victoria-Gadbaa shelter.
Regress to a child's condition - for some tolerable humiliation.
"Everybody depends on the ability of man" to come to terms with falling, he claims.
Because many people in palliative care believe that important events are happening at the very height of the fall.
Patients who come to Victor Gadba's palliative shelter are all suffering from cancer.
Projections give them a maximum of three months.
At this stage, the medical team and nurses do not provide any more assistance called “medical”.
Ms. A., 89, was the most afraid of dying "in consciousness of suffocation".
But the disease has made me know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in my life," she says, before I let her put a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for her son, who came from Italy, to visit her last visit in the near future.
At the Victor Gadbua shelter, a group of volunteers provided care for the body and food aid.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing can be done anymore.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, every 11,700 residents have one place in the institutions of palliative care.
That's very little, given that sooner or later we're all gonna die.
Here life continues in the best possible conditions, as Dr. Christian Martel explains, one of the doctors in the shelter.
Be comfortable physically, emotionally, or emotionally.
The dying one will agree to place his mouth belts out of his brandy or pepsies, whatever he asks.
We don't force diabetes to control sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of the day-to-day cycle.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H. who died last night.
In the morning, his son had a beer in his feet.
“We help our loved ones, just as we help patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of care for the patients.
In the Victor Gadbua shelter, it is not the same as the previous day.
Near the 93-year-old man, who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, resting on his pillows in his honour, tragically dies a young man 36 years old, surrounded by parents, wife and two young children, and has tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, three to five beds are always busy with cancer patients under 45 years of age," Dr. Christian Martel says.
53 per cent of the patients admitted to the Victor Gadbua shelter are from home and 47 per cent are from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
77 per cent of Canadians are believed to have no access to palliative care, i.e., care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients in the final stages of their lives, whether at home, at the hospital or at the shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor Gadbua shelter and the More Montreal Community palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this great gap in Quebec’s health system that has caused many palliative doctors to fear the adoption of legislation to legalize euthanasia and to help with suicide.
Beginning in October, a manifesto signed by the palelators in palliative care, Dr. Balfour Maunt and Dr. Bernard Laapunt has been circulating to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative high-quality care before a transition to euthanasia is permitted.
Recently, she says, "I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to alleviate them.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have tried to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
The hope of survival of Ellen Richard was already minimal when she stopped her inhaling chemotherapy.
When I told my oncolon that I had stopped treatment, she replied that she regretted that I had stopped fighting, she told me.
She told me she'd been counting my days!
No comprehensive care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of the patients who ask for death thanks to the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not entirely comprehensive in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the Major Montreal Home Community, patients are not sensitive to pain treatment in 8 percent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to a palliative session, where the patient sleeps until the moment he dies, either from time to time or at all times.
We cannot pretend any more that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more often, patients who are not able to alleviate the pain can have access to palliative meals.
Painless patients always say the same thing, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to have euthanasia," it means "I want to get easier."
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute for Health Research of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political party fund collectors and Italian mobs day by day tell of what they know about the huge “system”, the misleading construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobilizers.
The “Industrialization”, which was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's nice how the system is disintegrated after all the money has been lost, that Jacques Dushenno, the deputy and the former chief of the Montreal Police has been joking."
It was thanks to him that, in 2011, a scandal broke out as a by-product of the investigation of the Quebec road construction offences, to which the Prime Minister of the time from liberals, Jean-share, had agreed very reluctantly.
The Dushenno report established a direct link between industry, clandestine financing of political parties and corruption.
“From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stresses that the Ministry of Transport alone would retain billions of dollars in contracts” if some held back their instincts.
The Sharbonno Commission has "threated two mayors", adding, hoping that it will be able to "discover the schemes of individual persons".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, was involved in the case and included a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, staff of the Molot Special Unit, who after 2009 had forced Montreal's “test card”, have ceased overestimation of contracts.
A series of searches had been carried out over the past weeks, and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richar Markat, mayor of a small town, had been charged with fraud and corruption.
In line is Gil Weiyankur, who recently resigned from the rank of Mayor Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of receiving bribes on several occasions when placing government orders.
In addition, several engineers in Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin were formally charged, including Tony Aktouroto and Lino Zambit.
The latter exploded the real bomb, following an investigation into a “system” for obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambit has donated 3 per cent of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to some of the Mafia broker who, in turn, transferred the money from the mayor of Gerald Tramum to the United Montreal Party.
In the 2000s, Zambol lost his money to the right and left and listed over US$ 88,000 (some US$ 68,000) to various parties in the province, mostly Liberians then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he had illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Transfer contracts where the value is overstated
In Montreal, corruption was unreserved.
Gile Surprenan, a former civil construction engineer, described her in detail before the Commission: within ten years, he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, to golf tours, to restaurants, to hockey matches and to bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts that he had overstated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted to having received a paw oversteps 30 to 40 per cent by false additions.
Next, a mayor’s organizer, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes to the existence of a parallel budget filling the party’s cashiers with dirty money.
Following those revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early November, loading Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to be alarmed.
The Rivier de Préy County mayor on the east is against the sale of a 5 million dollars municipal property and resold for 1.6 million developers at the height of the building tower since 2010.
70% of dirty money in pre-election campaigns
She says that in the investigation that will eventually be initiated, she “takes a thread to understand the function of an ant system in order to stop the gangrene and identify the perpetrators”.
This process has been described as “a painful but positive one”.
We are in the wound-cleaning process, but Montreal will need a self-investigating team and an observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
We're going home.
Regularly.
Jacques Dushenno, for his part, observes that "the performers have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "election officials who know the pattern," but who have not participated in the schemes.
Given that the share of dirty money in the financing of the Quebec electoral campaign is 70 per cent, he jokes, "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Québec government proposes a reduction of up to $100 in donations to parties, but he said that it would not change the situation: "until we strictly limit elected spending, politics will be dirty money."
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of government contracts and party finance: “We cannot descend below; with the courage to find out, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy”.
If this is a story that casts shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchenno calls on those who laugh to look into their own yard...
"PWW isn't a FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you've achieved an extraordinary dimension.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but it may also be by a new dimension of APV.
Great players have arrived.
I grow with them every day.
Technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
It's going very fast in football.
But I'm not breaking up.
From the outset, at the pre-trial training center at Clerphone and before I arrived in St. Estienne, I was always on the move.
So, you're benefiting from the competition that Carlo Anchelotti has established...
The filling of this summer is not a high-level game of games.
They also know that each exercise is very important.
That makes a player like me want to be at the level and stand up at the top.
In addition, Carlo Ancheloti supports my positioning.
He's helped by alternates like Claude Macelele, who's playing the same position as I am.
Antelopes - Master of Situations?
Of course.
The Anjlotti is a source of respect for all technical staff.
Today, he has no equal in the First League, and he is among the best trainers in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with high-quality clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I was away from a series of injuries.
The trust it gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PMS season?
In the First League, Lyon took our leader's seat.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is the League of Champions: we have effectively classified ourselves as one eighth of the finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We're going to go as far as possible.
From now on, it could be.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, in Porto, in order to be able to accept the one-eighth final match.
Could the APJ become a first-class European club in the short run?
He already has a budget for that...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needed to win titles and build positions for the long term.
That's not the case today.
Financially, POW has the means to make the project real.
Do not take title in the First League, how will this past season be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship.
We were close to this last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had everything to come to the finish.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points imply championship.
But the other team, Monpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that strong teams such as Marseilles, Lyons and Bordeaux have taken part in the title struggle, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media's waiting too much for POW?
It's normal to expect a lot from us, given how much money was invested and what kind of players we have.
We're ready for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua at home, and we're still going to be criticized for doing that, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We ask the question, What kind of people are we first looking forward to?
We can never win every weekend with an account of 4-0.
We're not a FC Barcelona!
We're trying to start a project game.
The team is formed over time.
We have proved in the League of Champions that we can meet today's challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who has been unable to walk into the eighth final, for two seasons!
In view of the amounts invested, we represented you 15 points in front of the winter break.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseilles, who were not heightd during the past season, were “dangled” by this new PAS.
This shows how exciting the first League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
RAS seems to be totally dependent on the achievements of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, if they say there's some sort of obstinacy.
It merely means that Ibrahimimovich is very successful and that he kills a lot of heads.
He's here to prove he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he was playing, he showed him to be a big player and a star of global scale.
In the group, we respect him as a human and a player.
He also respects people who surround him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Tiyogo Silva, who is one of the best advocates in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro2012 from the French assembly?
As a disappointment.
I was eager to be involved in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma has prevented me from wasting some game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out stronger.
Today, I'm good at playing good sampling matches.
This is what I had hoped for since I was baptized with the Sons.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must behave in a exemplary manner.
What do you think of the first months of Didusham, headed by the Sons?
They're good for him.
He has good positions in the selection team for the world championship.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players and inspiring to win.
Who was Laurent Blance.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blance achieved his goal, qualified us for Europe.
I hope Didier Deschamp will lead the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved kidney (1-1), torn out on 16 October in Spain, is that a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Prior to this shock in Spain, my career wasn't like a match.
Paying and selling without the help of banks, from Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current cash exchange based on centro-banks, the transactions between the receiving parties and the fees for processing them.
Moreover, as often happens to these technologies, the political outlook is clear: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Beatcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (Psydoun), is at the same time a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, Euro ...) and a protected protocol for exchange by type BitTorrent, which allows file sharing between participants at the same level.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousands of websites accept bitumen for donations or as a payment.
The bitquina had reached a maximum of $30 (Euro23) in June 2011, five months later it fell to $2 before returning to about ten dollars today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com web site).
Nothing special compared to the world’s exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has taken an interest in the system in its report on virtual currency published in October.
It describes the bitten as “the most successful virtual currency”, “concursing with the dollar or the euro” and “likes normal currencies”.
It is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as "credits" used to move into video games that are earned during the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
Facebook also developed a similar system.
But exchanges are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitkoin, all nodes are both book holders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two electronic addresses, like an e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relevant to this transaction is electronically signed using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitumen used in the transaction does exist in a public account sent across the network.
A key step is to record a new transaction in the book.
It comes through a mathematical task that has been sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, has the privilege of adding this new line.
This is the hashing phase of the file, that is, the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
The computer will take a new transaction and add a number to it before we put it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a multiple zero at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other knots are easily checked for correctness.
In this way, the chain of all other transactions is unreserved; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user would wish to pay twice the same price and the subject twice in ten minutes, only one of these two transactions would have been confirmed by the network, while the other would have been unconfirmed because they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem gets 50 bitumen.
In order to avoid inflation, the reward is likely to be shared in half by the end of 2012.
The number of bitikins in the treatment is therefore limited to 21 million, but they're divided up to one million dollars, leaving another reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with increased computing power.
The life of the network has already survived takeoffs and falles.
Beatcoin sites were attacked and beaten from reserves.
“The defect used is not related to the protocol itself”, assures Pierre Nouza, who recently launched Paymium, the real money company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as WordPress blogs, are allowed.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel examined the e-book and discovered that almost 80 per cent of the bitumen were not in circulation.
The giant sales were announced in November.
"Thirsty thousand dollars have been traded," happy to see Jon Holmkwist working for Coinabul, who's working to convert the bitumen into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in these days) or a mobile phone fixed-payment payment, but she uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which is therefore cheaper.
The holder has better control over his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
All you have to do is tell the address that you can "photograph and identify" by telephone, clarify Pierre Nuaz, telling him that he has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to review hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
"There will be an end to it, and it will be some time, but 2013 may be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report proposes, by the way, to review the various risks considered to be raised today if the system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French forces have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capina and Surabi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow them at the end of 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, not just in our hope.
We were mostly affected by Afghan peasants, whom we viewed as terrorists .
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed and wounded and treated.
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, former fugitives in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even though Jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are tolerated, sometimes assisted by local rebels, but they will no longer be treated as soon as the West acts more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I have observed since the hills of the almond trees that have been planted, thanks to French loans, has taken place in order.
Convoys of trucks and armoured personnel accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed from the permanence of their progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty at the time, the country was in the fire and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
Their taking control of the country was then seen as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for these peasants ' mires, where they were over Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved in our time.
The former modemedes, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to hold women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become agents of state land to resold them for the construction of returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge United States subcontracting contracts.
They were discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, want a government that isn't a thief.
Many young people want to leave, as will those of America’s generosity: capital outflows mean.
Young people have lost sight of the war and its ideology.
They lived in a modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; there are now 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
State schools in cities are filled with boys and girls alike.
There is a need to provide employment for these young people who will not want to return to either the old parties or the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed fighters, love mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the world today and that watch everywhere.
There's an army at the moment.
The authorities that will command her will be considered legitimate?
The old commanders in the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to rebuild provincial wives who are not subject to central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to a certain extent, according to a model of Western countries, but the United States wanted to make it a centralized State with a strong presidential authority, which had been suspended by the Prime Minister, who had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, depended on foreign aid.
Industry was not put on its feet, no dam was functioning, no irrigation system was repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, State control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has huge mineral assets.
This only added to the feeling that the Western countries were present for the purpose of getting hold of them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transportation to export them through mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Med Mess of Iinka, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig a huge Buddhist complex and to remain the largest provincial employers.
It is also essential that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend heavily on imports and exports, restore normal relations on one day.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: girls ' faces, boys, French Department of Language at University, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to build hearts and minds, and to carry out the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the Military Civil Activities Service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimi), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public activities and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of the local labour force, helped to contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, protection of soils, and increased land area.
What would we leave to remember if we spent two billion euros on military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the province of Kapina.
To rid themselves of the rebellions led by foreign groups, what farmers told me they had to do, we had to give them a little bit of non-military support that would be well-controlled and direct to them.
Hard births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky step by President Muhammad Mursey.
While Egypt had been divided more than ever, on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, he had decided to play the Va Bank.
He announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
Soon after, Egypt relied on the preliminary text, which had been amended several times, which weakened institutional stability and led to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "auto-circumcision", continuing to "break up the word" and "relie the right."
In the camp its followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that led Brativ to abandon his intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, article by article.
For the President, it is also a way of restoring social and democratic legitimacy, while grievances are raging throughout the country.
Muhammad Morris seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with Time's United States weekly.
In particular, the call for an accelerated vote is based on the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: “Whether you vote in favour of my text or if I leave myself extraordinary powers”, which is expected to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they bawled the door, feeling unable to communicate.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
To ensure that the required quorum is achieved, 11 persons, spare participants, were successfully added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It was no wonder that in most cases the articles had been unanimously proclaimed.
Commentators, by the way, have taken away from the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around... the time to pray, as some members of the committee felt that the meetings of the Constituent Assembly were not well built.
The text on which the vote was taken yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The focus of general attention, article 2, ultimately remained identical from the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of the Shariah are the main source of the law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law was a basic requirement, hoped to replace “principles” with “rule” so that they could be more rigorously applied.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other participants in Egyptian society.
'Licemerie' answers liberals who see only the pie in it.
Because, in their view, the Islamization of the Constitution is taking place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular in verifying compliance with the law of the Shariah.
According to Egypt’s expert Sophie Pomie, this is alarming, “that is, people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can watch the breakup of the theocracy."
Many liberals are also impressed by the fact that the next Rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
“There is no specific religious intervention at present.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ules, but university students, some of whom have studied in the French system, and who have been preparing a dissertation on Egypt's constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that “the scope of article 220 may be mixed, as the terms used therein are drawn from religious lexicons.
This applies in particular to the “marks” [Islamic jurisprudence].
In the future, the question may arise as to how competent civilian judges are to make such decisions.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claimed that they had decreased significantly compared with the old regime.
Another contentious point is the authority of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will not be considered in Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
Nor would the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests by human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text which they considered destructive to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Furthermore, none of the articles speak of the protection of women any more, says Heba Moreaf, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to speak on television last night, the demonstration is scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State, in turn, will enter the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Pup of the Earth, and the sea from the creek
The earth is filled with the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort, and natural superiority.
AIF has identified five of the most important reasons to be visited in Israel.
Worshiping Sacred Places
We should visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that God's grace is due to everyone who enters this “buyer. ”
And Galileo is the place of Jesus ’ miracles: making the wedding of water into wine, walking in water, calming the storm, and filling the nets.
Jesus, on the other hand, appeared here before his disciples after being resurrected.
Most important, though, is the shrine in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here walk in the Path of Scorby or in the Cross Road of Jesus (in Latin, Vía Doroosa).
It begins with the loyalty of Antonia Pretoria, where there was judgment, and in the streets of the Old City brings into the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre at Mount Golgoph, the site of Respusia, the Stone of Anointed One, and the place of burial of Jesus.
Here, too, is the symbolic Christian Pup of the earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be built in a place where Christian legends have led to the growth of a tree from which they made the cross for Jesus to be impaled.
Jerusalem is the most holy place for the Jews, Stan Placha, who left the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave notes of will and wills to be fulfilled.
Do a Vertical Travel
Massad’s fortress remains a secret haven from the enemy Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on mountain ranges at 450 m above sea level.
Only those who have been involved in alpenism can do so.
The remaining ones are taken to this historic summit by the guideway.
And in the north, at a height of 1,600 to 2040 metres, there is the famous Hörmon Mining Court, with a huge tourist influx in the winter months.
A bus shuttle is delivered to him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the rails is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, pagan gods were said to have lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You won't be able to visit everyone for one trip.
But at least five of them most interesting are worth a visit.
Among them are the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset.
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's also worth a visit to the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
The paintings of impressionists and expressionists in Mone, Pissarro, Renoar, Cezanne, Sisela, Matissa, Modilian, Chagala, Piccasso are well represented.
It is possible to visit Al-Basa Museum in Akkoa, which is a series of old Turkish baths with visitors and canisters of the time.
In Cesaria, we should visit the unique private Museum of Rally, where we can enjoy the sculptures of Dalí and Rogen.
There are no guides and gift benches.
The entrance is free, and the donation is not categorically accepted.
Fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yed-Yourme Museum in Tel Aviv, talks about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the Children ' s Memorial, is built into the memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas cells.
You enter it, and you end up in absolute darkness.
Stars kiss.
The names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they were killed are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Healthy
Israel ' s three main resort areas are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them has basins, aquatics, dolphins and oceanics.
Interestingly, even in the winter months, the Red Sea does not bathe below 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air warms to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The Dead Sea is still warmer, and it buys round a year.
By the way, the world's lowest point of view is 417 meters below sea level.
The lassar water in it is a diesel that can easily keep afloat without even being able to swim at all.
The carriages are fantastically beautiful.
They come here to undergo treatment with salt water - nozzles, whole dirt, and to treat the health of dermatites, allergies, asthma, exema, eczemas, arthritis, bronchants, sugar diabetes, in order to bring in the brushed nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Ancient times
They are kept by an ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffo on the shores of the Mediterranean.
It was the famous Sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
By tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
The tourists love to hang around a small piece named after Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street with your sign, Fortuna will become a favor.
Youths from all over Israel and even from other countries can be found in Jaffo.
And in Caesaria, the city of King Herod, you can move through the Roman theater, the "circuit" of the peasants.
During the Roman period, Cesarius was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
A carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A Visit to a Note
When you go to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population knows Russian.
The money to travel is better than the euro, but in dollars, which is easy to trade for shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is an express tram, and in Haif, the only subway in the country is a line of six stations linking the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's a underground cable.
Travel on all kinds of urban transport costs 6 shekels, which can be taken with transplants for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, a Sabbath is observed in Jewish tradition.
From Friday to sunset Saturday, markets, shops and public transportation cease to work.
A working week begins on Sunday morning.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food excluding lead, seafood, fish without shoes and food that combine milk with meat.
There, large choices are made of lambs, beef, soups, and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste furs, various sauces, and milk - ferral balls, and fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fattened cats who are poignantly "sing on their own."
At evening they are seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Ants love people's places and don't give up the food.
Rental of a car, depending on the mark, would cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The plus of the insurance is $15 a day.
And a ride of a bicycle will cost up to 15 shears a day.
Museum tickets averaged 30 shekels.
Language of digits
In 2012, Israel visited over three million tourists from all over the world.
U.S., Russian, French, German, Italian, English, and Ukrainian citizens were most likely to travel and rest.
From January to October 2012, there were 118,000 Ukrainian tourists, 51 per cent more than the 2010 figure, pending the lifting of visas on 9 February 2011.
The great and powerful will transmit to Moscow: migrants will dig money in the language.
While deputies and human rights defenders argue that they will give the mandatory language test law, there have already been frauds in the country selling “liplary” certificates
Every year, 13 million gas - burning people come to Moscow, Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left behind in their homeland.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force requiring each migrant worker to pass an examination for the Russian language.
To date, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the areas of services, housing and utilities, welfare and retail.
But over time, the PMS promises, the tests will be binding on all visitors.
At least one will have to give not only a language, but also a Russian history and the basis of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both for receipt and for extension of the work permit.
Exclusions only apply to citizens of countries where Russian is a State language.
The law does not apply, nor do those who have succeeded in obtaining certificates and certificates of education before the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, duty and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will work under the auspices of the Russian Puškin Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the IHU, the SRG and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
Both Members of the State Department and the FMU supported the Test Initiative.
And here's the human rights defenders before the law came into force and they've been able to ask the press many times about what's going to happen?
What will change whether knowledge of the language is necessary for the Russians or for the visitors themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service are responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from labour slavery.
Very many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explaining the head of the Russian Federation ' s representation in Tajikistan, Victor Eveslev.
Protection of their rights must begin before departure.
Only an organized recruitment system would solve foreign workers' problems by 90%.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, in education that does not speak a language that does not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, surely she will have a future migrant to face some infamous people who, in the form of assistance, will bring him a boat into a strange, close barracks, where he and dozens of others will spend months without food and documents, bringing him 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“In their home country, they are promised one thing, and they are deceived by their arrival, picked up their passports, and do not pay the promised salary”, confirms the Director of the Directorate of Labour Migration of Tajikistan, Tolyb Sharipov.
Don't worry, Nuns!
However, so far, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are about to make a living in Russia have admitted that they are not only unaware of the language of the country they seek, but are having difficulty writing in their own language.
Of course, it is not as much of their fault as it is that few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even an interpretation of primary education.
Indeed, their families have nothing to do with feeding their children, let alone wear them, bathe them, and put them in school.
As you reach the age of your youth, these guys go to work at the very first opportunity.
It is difficult, if they are not well versed in the language, they will be admitted.
"You are acting in a state of destitution and incomparable worth."
It is true that one important point is noted with regard to the law on the language of human rights defenders.
The test will be conducted only for those migrants with legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the Gararbyters continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or the Non-Bettered Entrance"
Many of the visitors claim that it is not so easy to get official status in our country.
The reason is for bureaucratic constraints and all the same linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs between 12 and 16,000 roubles.
And this is a false registration that can be made quickly and in just half a thousand.
The Russian police know we have mostly false documents, we don't have registrations, here are extortion cases.
"A hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," shared a citizen of Tajikistan's national, Oued Khuwdam.
"Let's go, let's go, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that not only migrant registration documents were false.
Several “left” certificates of language tests have already been seized by the FMS.
Fake paper printed on a conventional color printer.
Of course, the new owners have not received a gift; each of the migrants so hoping to facilitate the task of passing the tests paid 7,000 roubles for the document.
This is two times the cost of a formal test: it will cost a migrant worker 3,000.
That the main challenge is to protect the system from corruption, so that “creatures” cannot be simply bought, the authorities gathered, and human rights defenders alike.
In the meantime, the authorities may promise more than first-time testing, time for basic language training.
In addition, non-Russia visitors will be offered employment in areas that do not include active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not engage in trafficking in illicit arms markets
The proportion of offences with legal weapons is very low
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law against the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: to hit a wedding when there were no casualties, and the slaughter by Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit the wearing of trauma in public places and raise the age from which they can obtain a licence for weapons from 18 to 21.
It supported the head of the thinking committee on security and anti-corruption of Irin Yorov and promised that the arms law would be amended in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by “scrolling the hooks”.
An open letter emerged from the network, which the authors of various public small organizations demanded that there be no “unreasonable tightening”.
The percentage of the gun row was minimal, and declared by the Bi-Biss Lawyer of Vasili Lesnikov to the Russian Service.
Statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs show that 142 firearms crimes registered in internal affairs were committed in the six months of 2012, compared with 1,168,000 offences in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not place the offender in the black market.
They now say that any weapons can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to control the proliferation of illicit weapons.
Vendors: From factories to officers
The Black Arms Market is being filled through several channels.
The main channels are five, reports Colonel Victor Barancz, who worked in the Ministry of Education and Genstab for ten years.
Screening of a weapons order site
The first is “army or military tracks”, that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The Russian officers and the Caucasians have dragged the weapons," says Barancz.
The next form of "black weapons" is stolen by criminals from the security structures.
Barancé explains that the police warehouses and those stolen directly from the law enforcement personnel are included.
Illegal barrels go to the market from war warehouses.
Many military warehouses often witnessed explosions.
"There are some proven versions that some of the fire has been made specifically to cover the shortfall," says the former military.
The Branz is said to be used by arms manufacturers.
"There are now private weapons plants that fail to compete in the international market and throw arms out of the basement into the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Particularly do guns and assault rifles from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, are used in many ways.
"There's a production of its own, sometimes shrubbery, and there's a mob that's organized a flow," explained the former military.
Where's the weapon from?
The experts figured out how close each of the sources of illicit arms transfers to the “black” market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
Experts have analysed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data on weapons-related portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the writers of the researchers, come from the army and the security forces.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there “on the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons” in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the cases of weapons coming from places of armed conflict, 14 per cent of the cases are reported to be thefts at the arms production stage, and 5 per cent are in “black archaeology”.
The consulting seller of one of the arms stores, who has asked not to call his name, assures us that the weapons found by the black diggers have been gone for too long, too long.
Most often, he says, a new shipment of vendors is going to a military warehouse.
Through the flagman, a person buys a unit, like a TT gun.
They write it out, they send it through the fence.
"He transports her to town and sells him 900 euros apiece with two shops," he says.
“Right, the police are aware of all cases, so when a crime-discovering plan burns, the crime dealers are subject to control by the illicit arms dealers,” adds a consultant.
"As in a luxury store."
The seller and buyer are most likely to find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking on websites, on blogs, until the comrade who's offered to come to the Bogoya platform, where there's a man who's gonna take me to the corner where we're going to trade.
The price of a gun I only found out there.
Military columnist Victor Barancz
To get the gun, I need someone I know who has a way out, and they tell the consulting seller.
There are salesmen on the market, but we also have to come, conditionally, from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked for the transmission of the daughter's tooth.
I'm getting even a couple of tapes right now because of someone I'm sure of.
He's giving them to me, too, because he knows I won't give them up.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Barancz tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared an article on it.
Schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photos of "anything" in it.
"I felt like a luxury store," says the military.
You don't have a cat in a bag, you can try everything, according to Bananza.
I'm a potential client, not just buying -- we're going with the seller to the woods, we're putting a target.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I'm sure the weapons are going well, we're going to trade," the expert's procedure.
It's on the couch.

United States employees of fast food and supermarkets
The Macdonalds cash company takes up to a quarter of all U.S. teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart Universitys and restaurants of popular quick-food networks, such as McDonalds, Burger King, Tao Bell, Anders and Kentukki Fraid Chikans.
As long as no one is willing to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth shaft or be judged to emerge in the early stages of life.
Action supports trade unions and a number of left-hand public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries of the ordinary workers of Walmart and the fast-food system, the aim of protestors is to establish trade union organizations within them.
Until now, this sector of the economy has been largely excluded from the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The stock started last week, after the Thanks Day, on the so-called "The Black Friday", when America was hit by a trade of cheap sales, captured by millions of fans and sometimes accompanied by crazes.
On that day, some of the workers of Walmart, in which 2.2 million people are employed worldwide, left their jobs and picketed with trade unions and left activists at corporations whose goods are calculated against people of modest and medium means.
Walmart sells everyone in the world, from ashes, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The average product in its shops is between 8 per cent and 27 per cent cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low - paying workers of Walmart are on their way to work.
The availability and availability of goods has made Walmart one of America’s largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell a product at a cost partly because he pays little to his employees.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, such as lack of goods or manual scanners.
The participants in the “Black Friday” stock demanded a wage increase and complained that the cost of the company's health insurance had jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who gets $9.5 per hour, that's not out of pocket, they say.
Scientists at the University of California at Burkley prove that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost corporations $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1% more than she's spending on wages now.
If Walmart completely puts a price increase on the customer’s shoulders, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
They're going to spend $12.39 more per year than they are now.
The Walmart supporters note quite well that protests took place in only nine states and did not cause the worst damage to corporations.
The Thursday Friday continued at her shops from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items a second.
In total, her cashiers made almost 100 million transactions on the Black Friday.
Dan Foilman, a representative of the corporation, argued in an interview with the left website of Huffington Post, that the jobs had been abandoned by a total of five Walmart employees, and that the protest was just another "Pyaror's trick" of the organizing trade union.
"Free cashier!"
Protesters continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted at the Walmart Umbrücks (they do not complain in this progressive city, and therefore they are not still here) but the McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he's selling billions of meals, and then he doesn't even give you sick people or pay you a decent job!
Jamine Williams, member of New York Mountain
At present, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York legislation, is $7.25 per hour.
Rapid meals have been increased over time, but not much, and on average, workers in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
Less of them in this dear city are not earned.
As can exist in New York on such money, it's unsteady for me.
Almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked for their backyards after school while still living with their parents were involved in the McDonalds.
Few have seen this major source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly face interviews with McDonalds' employees who complain that they should live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum offers a comment whose author notes that irresponsiblely drives children if you don't know what you're going to feed them for.
The protestors, which began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday morning at Maddonalds on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and the fast-food system start paying at least $15 an hour, that is, more than doubling their current minimum earnings.
They also required that trade union organizations be established in the area of rapid nutrition.
The American law prohibits and penalizes trade unionists with proselytizations and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is also difficult to provide quick food for trade unions for objective reasons.
One of the most important is an unannounced turnover.
Dissenting
There were shocking protests on that day and a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
At the middle of the day, a rally at the Maddonalds near Times Square spoke at which several local Democratic politicians spoke, in particular, a member of the Jomain Williams, who said, "Macdonalds" said that he sold billions of portions, and after that, he didn't even give you hospital and pay you for honest work."
Other prominent New York democracies, such as Bill De Blasio, were also supported by the demonstrators, who stated that “we must be friendly in supporting the fast-food workers so that they could achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that each New Yorkec deserves.”
As New York Times described, this was the largest act of this kind in the history of American rapid feeding.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, and not all of them were part of a rapid hospital where tens of thousands of people were employed in New York City.
It is not clear whether this spark of mass movement will produce fire.
"Taking to deceive the brain is going to be averaged."
A theme recently adopted among modern technology worshipers that has been supplemented by reality is largely due to the prism of the eyes.
First in summer, at its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that the patent application had also been submitted by Microsoft.
However, from the discussion with the leader of the 3D interactive technology team at the Cambridge Laboratory, Microsoft Sharam Izadi indicates that for scientists in the company, the chatka is the stage covered.
They are manned by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Could you please tell me what your research team is doing?
- We're dealing with man and machine, but we're trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as humanity is stuck in the mass, it's working with the pickets on a flat screen, sometimes using a finger in them.
We want to look 5-10 years in advance and anticipate fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is sold, because everyone is interested in sign language management.
- What else lies ahead?
- Even though Kinect has had physical interaction, much is still happening on a flat screen, sometimes on a 3D screen.
Input has improved (the system receives more data) and output is not yet very good.
We're trying to change this by working on really three-dimensional display systems from different technologies, including projectiles.
We need to put the computer world in our physical world, making it more tangible.
This requires, however, that we recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient way.
And first of all, those stupid helmets are virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
Popular stuff, but don't they overestimate it?
- He's certainly not a panacea - the question of privacy, because I don't always want to tell people about my actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in their kidneys.
For example, for the management of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not over mischievous ones, but over these whole, short ones.
The gestures, however, were made, not by the camera of the device, but by a handcuff, which recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
So far it's large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the hand hours.
But even the future behind a mixed type of management, like gesture plus voice.
- How's that?
- Like, how do you ask me to give you this gas jar?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm just saying.
- Oh, it'll be very hard to recognize.
- So you want users to adapt to what the car can or can't at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's mutual convergence.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work mostly to develop new sensor types that will allow us to define more precisely the human response.
It might be, like, laser sensors, they're giving a good resolution in depth, it's very important.
- In terms of your Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Lack of permission, depths or anything?
In principle, the present generation is something that we can learn from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to have mega-pixels 8 at 1000 km/s.
But it's not about the megapixels themselves, it's about the matrix and the depth.
In the latter sense, all the current technologies are not good for us, which adds to the work of algorithm designers.
So not only do we have to remember the X and Y resolution but Z as well.
Speed is also very important, staff per second.
The human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are very low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betichez, of our Raymond Laboratory, made a sensor for controlled processing, from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands the effect that this has on man’s and machine interactions.
I'd be very useful at my job for the equivalent of a device that does not require a touch so that the staff per second will be larger.
- Don't you need a bigger number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cells, one of which is actually an infrared radiator, and the other is the receiver of a reflected signal.
And this is the third camera, which is actually the usual visual range sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or add to it by increasing the amount required.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog of Kinect, play with the camera's curvature, and see how this will help in the three-dimensional definition of the position.
- I remember Microsoft did not present his points, unlike Google.
Don't you think, from the point of view of the everyday use of these enhanced chaise technologies, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time it's done, holding a smartphone in the arms raised is not very convenient, but I think that the coolest option would be a "transporting" complemented reality where, on a cloud platform, you could switch from points to smartphone, projection display to anywhere else.
The glasses are a very personal device, and in this they have the strength, and at the same time the weakness, a complemented reality on the basis of eyeglasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's introduce for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic facilities in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from the Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
There is a problem that is often criticized by critics: there is no tactful response!
My hands don't feel anything!
What are your group’s answers to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that a complemented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human interaction and machine.
I think the eighth may well be the adder of tactile feelings.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a kind of front for the image.
She's a great recorder of pressure!
But there are technologies that really aim at giving these "inhales" to the air -- for example, the interference of several focused ultrasound beams at a given point where the finger is lying -- gives you a sense, but while it's very weak, like you're on a pillow.
There are wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in your fingers -- that's the way forward.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain?
Making him think he feels what seems to be going to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried it yet.
There is another challenge that remains to be fought long enough to make a person physically in a very limited area believe that he is walking on an open, almost endless, work on the concepts of running pathways (not at all like clubs) moving platforms, as well as huge layers.
As long as the brain's deceived, it's been working for a very long time.
That's what makes working on the virtual reality of such an attractive thing for the researcher -- a lot of things in a completely conceived state.
The taste instead of culture is Rosbalt.
"Rosbolt" is continuing a project called "Peterburg Avangard" on the front citizens in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top-list already contains the bright figures of the St. Petersburg City, whose achievements go beyond the city, often in recognition in Europe, at the mercy of all-Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbolta" is a careful painter, Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Kirilla Miller, a bearded man dressed in all the reds that meet him at the Russian Museum, and in the summer garden, on fashionable shoes and lintels.
Kirilla Miller's paintings always collect crowds of viewers wherever they stand.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely Pieterburgan socio-philophic storytists who have developed new mythology.
Killer's a bright man in the Petersburg vanguard in the late '80s, the early '90s.
He is also a man of the city, appearing on the streets of a smog smile at a citizen who raises his mood.
Recently, he took a scarf into his hands and became a Petrburg scarster because he was dreaming about this difficult role for all his godlike existence, philosophy, and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking around the city in all the red instead of yellow or turquoise?
- I chose red as a modeler of vision and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between artist, imagemaker and society.
While everything in society that's just a little unsurpassing, it's aggression and the inflammation of bad character.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
All the history of my provocative actions is an invitation to a discussion.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- In an exhibition in Nevski D.C., where my work was exhibited.
I realized it was my way.
At that time, the wave of old free informal artists went through, and new, free types of me were not clear.
I became a friend to the artists of the new wave, with the post-precipitation that led to Pushkin-10, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theatre, clothes, music, all but a word.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... and it was important for me to be in the center of Petersburg's culture, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took the land to Puskin-10, where, while there was no renovation, there was a musical and artistic club, a god club, a house of the Peterburgian god.
Many were born there: NOMA, Tekila Jazz, I remember Schnoura bringing up a project called "Hojo Van Gogh."
Schnour and his friends sang under the plywood of light songs, they were three-folded, among them was now the fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played alive, it became a Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the lead of many programs prior to the Gali-Ghalian times.
We gave them to Trachtenberg, and he had a great career, and he had a basic education and education.
The D 137 Gallery, the Gryboedov Club, is a sign from the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and our people are gone.
I'm the hero of last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the interview was in the press, and the prize was "People of Our City."
I was named the Master of the Year, and my culmination ended.
In new times, according to old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, and one can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a sense of manners.
- Many of my paintings are hips, they have vivid relevance and perturbation.
I'll have a software exhibition, "Rus museum in clowns".
Clowns are non-recurrent.
I used to be a social person now, it's painful and scary.
But in the clowns, everything's getting scattered, tragicism is getting rid of it.
I love grotesques, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, salvation of the world by totalitarian conversion in order of order.
They're now being dressed around the outside mechanics, not the inner person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand in his face to spit.
And the deception will be lifted by re-alignment.
And we saw you recently as a town charismatic.
Who wouldn't have to be like me.
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- The commercial art must now be neat, gentle, sweet.
There's cultural disgraving.
Previously, people had fallen into stables, a god loved one, a simple the other.
Now everything's broken into a micro-social society, it's going to be hard for everyone.
I'm not a $100 bar to like everyone.
Now you need to think who you like.
Now every cult hero has 100 worshipers.
- And the statues of Mikhail are a few thousand!
- He's got flops coming on, and it's the sex-social sphere working on him.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and eventually less management, less money, all away.
I have worshipers, and most of all, they won't be deceived, spoiled.
I used to write pictures like this when I was a kid of a collector on a wall next to Falk and Larion's estuary.
I started with paintings that usually end.
Now things are often confusing.
A spiritual culture, a culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of culture last day, and I grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint paintings.
I'm for this kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's the missing Pieterburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a culture official.
But not every one of them can have a culture.
The kings of the right world may not have understood the culture at all, but they knew that they needed to hold the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're out of the way because higher experts are needed to evaluate these experts correctly and give them their way.
The taste is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they're different because they're honest saying that not all modern art is something that we accept, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there's a lot more culture in Moscow, there's a soil there.
And it's hard on our stones to grow the art.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, which is wrong.
There's a lot of people in Europe who are curious. Those who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We've got a layer of a ton.
We need to make art as fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project executed on the St. Petersburg grant
Born in Space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with asteroid killers.
The caravans of spaceships with earthships on board are being sent to search for a spare planet.
In order to preserve mankind, the main question is how can we continue our lineage in a climate of obscenity or the same spare planet?
I think there's a little choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be treated hypothetically.
“This is Venus and Mars,” says Senior Fellow, State Astronomical Institute of P.K. Sternberg (GAWS), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions are more fit for life on Mars, Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
You can live only at high altitudes or in Venus's orbit... in space.
Approaching issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, plants were experimented with.
Four generations of built-in peas in orbit were in no way different from their earthly classes.
Then the removal of insects, tiny fruit fly Drzophils in orbit.
In 1979, eggs were sent to outer space to check on the development of embryos in a state of oblivion.
We're getting at the exit of a perfectly normal bird.
And then the problem starts.
“A problem related to this bird's need to find resistance, he must stand on his legs and start moving”, explains the leading laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) by Dr. Vladimir Sichev.
Not finding resistance, the birds huddled unfeelingly.
And after 10 hours, newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
They did not respond to light and sound.
And the trouble was that they had just died in four days.
"And twice we hatched the birds, and then we refused, because it's simply impossible to work with them," notes Vladimir Sychev's experiment with the birds in space.
With animals, the last time a biological "minics" flew in orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only a single-sex single-sex members will be on the Bion biosphere.
There was a experiment with rats that were already being sent to outer space with fruit.
In principle, there was nothing supernatural there.
'It was just on biosputniks, but again, it's a single experiment, and these studies need to be done,' says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the cosmos developed progeny.
But to get to the problem of procreation in space is not working out yet.
It's not an easy task.
The animal, the waste, the habit of living simply cannot realize its sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens have abstract thinking and can create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, no such experiments have been carried out.
But women in space have been flying for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereskov.
The most precious thing about humanity is the woman's organism.
Our tea has gone away, and no one on Earth could say, "Will it stay after flying into space?"
She's sad to have a baby after that flight.
"No one answered that question," says Wachtang Vanacze, a veteran of the missile and space industry.
In June 1964, just one year after the space flight, the first female cosmonaut of Valentina Tereskov gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrew Nicolaev, was also an astronaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitska, a second woman cosmonaut, had a son who had been in orbit and even worked in outer space.
The risk remains, however.
We don't have much, we have cosmonauts, and after long flights, everything has gone wrong, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if it's more, it's dangerous even in the orbiting flight," then a Cosmonaut pilot, Heroa of the Soviet Union, Hera of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet mankind needs to look for new ways of doing biotechnology, protection from radiation, and creation of artificial gravity.
KPC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory phase of pre-flight preparation.
Here, with a zero floating environment, the cosmonauts develop their working skills in outer space.
Water simulates indiscretion.
If adult water, though comfortable, but still alien, then for infants, it's a natural birth.
The little reptiles seem to confirm that life on land has gone out of the ocean.
There's a link between the fact that the baby has about nine months in an oxyted fluid, and it's easier for the baby to get used to the water later on.
It makes sense, in principle, because it's only two weeks from the moment of birth, from that first bath.
"It's very little to forget anything," says Marina Axenov, a farmer in breast swimming.
In words, if the child born to birth is more natural, the woman needs gravity, strength of gravity.
Very quickly, the muscles of the belly move in a foot, the thasa, and the ability to squeeze the fetus.
All right, let's do that by relying on descent stimulants.
You can, of course, in a special cell, go to a baby, she'll push it out.
"Then what?" asked Valery Polyakov's irretrievable questions.
On the other hand, a child needs artificial gravitation.
Without feeling earth’s pull, the body does not form a skeleton and a muscle system.
It is not possible for a new born in orbit to be dressed as an adult in a special training load suit.
He'll just be deprived of what he'll need.
"And this experiment that we're going to do with you, allowing a child to be born in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled, totally deformed human to Earth," predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the IIB van Igor Pesta.
So far, the birth of children in space is a question of theory.
In time, however, this will be a reality when the earth on its ships travels to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of Audit and Verification: The inspection of the spin-off system failed due to political blame.
In the public procurement industry, Czech Republic had good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, had been lagging behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview with Aktuáln .cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack," commented Cala's current situation.
Such findings provided joint inspection of Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter’s approach to the so-called spindle system draws on the approach of the so-called spindle system.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that GPP (Citizen Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is this prohibited or permitted?
“The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the institutions that are responsible for verifying and fulfilling the obligations”, notes Kala.
In a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you have spoken about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which has compared the laws on State procurement to the two countries.
What were you talking about?
There is a parallel check that we started, probably two years ago.
More simply, the European legislation argues that the way in which public procurement is to be conducted is followed by national legislation and then it is also applied in practice.
All the information has been gathered and, even if there is an unmanageable verification, there have been some interesting differences -- simply put it in our legislation, it may be “ exact and infallible”, but in our application we give Germany in some of the parameters.
It follows that it is not sufficient to create more and more refined rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you?
It is this joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to halt legislative clarification, reduce and improve restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means getting the stuff at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're going to achieve it by reducing our orders.
Perhaps the system will be replaced with “buquerants” so that those who want to find loopholes in the system find them much easier than if the restriction did not decrease.
You are referring to internal problems with the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization such as our CIA (Control and Auditing) or is it operating otherwise?
In terms of institutions, there is also a panel that works a little differently, but mostly both institutions operate the same way as we do the Bundesrechnungshof.
In addition, the powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and federal land, their system is slightly different from ours.
BDH can only run federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Courts of Accounts.
As far as local legislation is concerned, it's easier than we do?
Actually, I would not like to compare without specific data, but for some reason Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better than anything.
That's right, 'cause they're better at controlling?
Of course not, but to be repeated, I don't like that comparison.
But even exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have gotten any benefit from cooperating with our office, would they?
In the case of domestic legislation, how have the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affected your establishment, in some way, the consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been demonstrated in our monitoring work.
Since we're monitoring the fact, there's a delay to take into account.
We're taking that into account only in the preparation of future checks, we're starting to use our new tool, "intention risk of insecurity", through which we've driven almost 14,000 government contracts, and we've analysed them, and that's where, of course, these changes will happen because restrictions change, some types of tenders change, etc.
Do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or add to the burden on the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem may arise in such a way that the rules are “improved” and cannot be observed.
In the course of the previous rules, the controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g., regional operational programmes - the regional board) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does that mean that the law should be tightened in this way?
I think it's not that way.
The system should exclude those who wish to capture and abuse but do not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only exert even greater pressure on bureaucratics.
And then how do you get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that GPA will not bother entrepreneurs with checks of the so-called spindle system.
"Swiss-system" is prohibited or permitted?
The Act should be in some way established and, if it was prohibited, the Prime Minister could not resist the work of bodies that were required to verify and enforce obligations.
You could say, "We'll change this law and let it go," but we can't say we're gonna pretend nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains rules that are quite strict, and that must be formally implemented, and that is true, which will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the best-proposed candidate is disqualified only because of the formal shortcomings.
The law is never going to be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we don't have enough.
The roads are slippery, but they're mostly passageways.
In some Czech places roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly passing, but some of them are more cautious.
Carlos Land
This morning, in the Carlovian province, roads were passing, but some of them were frozen and snowy.
The temperature has fallen from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day the heat must be low.
The fall in the region has ceased, with only a small layer lying in the lowlands.
However, there are about 20 inches [30 cm] of snow on the ridges of the Red Mountains.
From information received from regional road workers, it was reported that the visibility was lower because of the fog.
The R6 speed highway and the first class roads in the region are now through without restriction.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface can be flattered and sliding.
Also, all roads relating to the second and third classes, including mountain highways, are in progress.
But some of them still have the remains of frozen snow on their sides.
You need to be especially careful on high - mountain roads.
The Pardobisk and Kralovegradsk Region
The Czech Highway Administration reports on its Internet pages that some roads in eastern Czech Republic are threatened with colds, and mountain roads and highland roads may be snowcapped.
Public road workers warn drivers of a holoed, which may be particularly on the tops of the Pardobian province.
Golded can be near Lanshkroun, East-Avian, Plyses, Svetvi, or High Míto, especially on second- and third-class roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34, located in Stitawi, are treated with chemicals.
The snow lies particularly on the Coconoche and Orlic Mountains.
The snow is snowed on roads on high ground in the Rijnow-na-Knejnog and Trutnov areas.
In East Bohemia today, it's a change of cloud without precipitation.
Temperatures usually vary from minus three to one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Plzen’s Edge
The roads in the Plzen province are passing this morning, but places need to be careful and adapt to weather.
In the morning, the temperature varies from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places, it may be slippery.
Drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
D5 highways are now practically unlimited, but road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the south, Pilsny and Takha may be hit by an infested area.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and there is also a warning for the possibility of sliding areas.
Drivers must be careful, especially on low-use roads in the Shumawa area.
The Olomotu Land
Drivers heading to the Olomowsk highlands should take into account snow-fed price on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Cherwengoor Sede and on the road towards the Vidalsksk.
At night the snowfall forced road workers to walk out, according to road administration information, about three inches [3 cm] of snow in Shumperke.
In other areas, roads are usually passed without restriction.
"The snow remains on the high plains of Schumper.
The drivers heading towards the Esenica should be aware of the presence of a snowmill in the Cherwengoor Sedle,” said the CHAN (Czech Agency of News) of the noise control.
The night after the road was cleared, their colleagues from Esenica assured them that the roads were naked and wet after handling the chemicals.
In the Olomoute road without restriction, drivers should be careful at forest areas where humidity still remains.
Mustard Land, Liberian Land
This morning road workers from northern Bohemia report that several difficult passage places remain.
According to information from the police database, in addition to a few places with a holoed or snow falling, the mountain road to the district of Telica on the Clinica in the West Coast has been closed.
The temperature remains low, so that snow and ice remain on the roads. In the low, especially south-east of the Czech Midland, there is no problem, however, the roads are mostly dry.
No road complications have yet been reported.
Road workers report a cold in the vicinity of Stite.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions were created at night for it to be created, with raining all day and melting snow, and the sky cleared and the freeze began.
The adverse conditions on the main highway and on the I/13 route at the Ustesk and Liberian borders are reported.
Because of the snow - covered branches of the trees surrounding the road itself, they had to close the road to Telnica at Kninica.
In concerts, we want to build up positive energy
What do you think the world must end in less than a month?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we humans are getting so easily at.
Along with the Tapp Top group, we are constantly joking about this and saying that we are the only group in the world that can gather sufficient positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you're going to give a completely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Would you like to know more about this?
This is a nationwide fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing capacity of the Maya calendar, which was announced at 11:10 a.m. on 21 December.
The day before, on December 20, the three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava are being launched in parallel at 2 p.m.
They will end, roughly, at a time when the Pacific island of Kiribati, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than we have, will end with the May calendar.
Who thought that idea?
It was my idea, and then we were all suppressing along with our artist, Honzia Augusto.
In addition to building sufficient positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to reflect with the public on the condition in which this world is going to pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we set up a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world, and we can buy these things from www.e-tap.cz and thus provide us with support.
The Top Top Top, along with other musicians, also fulfilled the doom against the end of the world, which is called the End of the World.
Will the already loved YouTube gymmin sound at these Beneficial concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if this works, and the end of the world doesn't come.
He's gonna be burned by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
The hymmes will also be broadcast on live Czech television.
Words to this song wrote and played Jesus ’ role in the Tomash Ghanak Cup, also in the execution of Xndl X...
How did you start cooperating with them?
We are also cooperating with other people in Czech cultural life, as we are conducting many charitable events and concerts.
We are actively trying to include them in these projects.
It turns out that many like to work with us, they're curious.
What would be the pleasure of a concert against the end of the world?
We have been working with a Tap civil association at the Edlika Institute for six years to purchase equipment for SUDEO-free educational centre.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Yedlika Institute Schools and have fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we thus try to give them this opportunity.
The project for additional construction of the Yedlika Institute will in the future generate a separate building to which we are moving with this project.
A number of musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to draw up a programme that will be of interest to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chineseski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Top Tab, Marian Bango, and Irgy Suhi will speak.
You can find both details at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such “responsive activities” in the future?
In May, we'll be performing for the first time at the Prey Spring festival and, of course, we'll have an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be happy to have a presentation at the Czech national home in New York, and I would like to speak in Washington, Chicago, personally, if we are to be in the United States.
About your abroad with serious plans, you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Top Top is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with your travels in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs are to travel in the baggage compartment, plus a whole lot of cargo and boxes with tools.
The Czech airlines and the British Airways have always been very good for us, and I was surprised for a number of times.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went without trouble.
Visits abroad allow you to compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations to persons with disabilities, and so forth.
What have you encountered to date?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we have, we have seen in Russia that the east is still at the basic level.
Compared with Prague, Moscow has many barriers and is still in the wild for its own human movement on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
And it's also not like you're going through all the junk things you can do to walk the way off with a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, social organizations have already been set up to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the other hand, is it that we must constantly catch up with the best countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to make it clear that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those involved.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own, go to the toilet, go to the museum, go anywhere...
It is not so common that a large number of people with disabilities are actively participating in public life, in this we are ahead of them with The Top Tapp!
Respect for the public or free will is one thing, but at a time when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, everything is really going to change.
While these are isolated cases, they're very voluminous people.
The Top Tab is now very popular, but we'll go back two years, what made you do it in 1998?
I went to the Yedlika Institute as a tutor, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician and I'm playing saxophones as well, my colleague and I had an interesting musical ring.
Well, over time, as our lead Ladje Angelovic says, it's a little out of control.
Popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confused?
That's true, it helped us to start joining famous singers and working actively on the propaganda of the group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can measure is essentially as if there is no work.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was the goal of your being so good?
From the very beginning, I felt their capacity to do something that wasn't out of the question.
Show business is full of things that resemble each other.
It's logical, it's taken with caution, and it's been going on for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Top Tapp is one of them.
The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, is naturally...
But that pity is very bad, because people with limited capacities are not something they are, and all the lost people that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the resources they need.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities get something, it's not just a shift for them, but for society as a whole.
Have you been successful in being a strong leader, as many consider you to be?
If we want to do quality work, we must be on many things and hold on to some discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with romantic performances and fly in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go twice a week to tutor, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, there are 20 people in the group The Tab Tab Tab.
How many were there early in 1998?
Just one Ladja Angelović.
We're an open group, people come and go, and that's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the willpower, our doors are always open.
It will be held one day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012, at 9: 00 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno, in the Club of Fléda and Ostrava, in the center of Plynojem, with 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by the television station at the time of the song of the group The Tap Tap “The End of the Light is cancelled”.
The objective of the project is to raise funds of 25 million kroner to purchase multifunctional barbarous equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Yedlika Institute in Prague.
There's 400 crown tickets for kids up to 12 years of age free entrance, and tickets can be bought in advance at Bohemiatickt.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has been actively involved in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But Poland's path to space had begun much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights to space, but this did not always come about with understanding.
I will recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, which was presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933 on the idea of “Introduction into Space”.
The young engineer’s ideas (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years he remembered that it was only Dr. Jan Hadsky who had an interest in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry Prize in France and Andre Luis Hirsche's "Initiation in Space."
Jan Hadhski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and space.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books dealing with these disciplines.
Hadean was a prominent global cosmonautist, and its contribution was appreciated, including the fact that one of the craters on the other side of the Moon was named after it.
As early as 1925, a rocket - equipped rail rod was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the draft.
It is not even clear that a rocket was to be used for the purpose of dispersal or braking.
Only the press of that era is aware of the firewood.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has begun to think about missiles.
The Arms Technology Section carried out the study in cooperation with Professors Macheslav Wolfke and Gustav Mokjiskim.
The remaining material shows that the studies have reached the practical test stage.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the Specialized Press came up with the idea of a photo-electronic fighter rocket proposed by the engineer Rogozinski, and next year the Inhaler-traped and Bombing Aerial Missile was released.
Both projects were developed for the military use of missile engines.
Before the war itself, the Interim Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczavi Komitet Doradczo-Nakway), which coordinated all of the work, had been involved in all military applications of missile technology.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended as a result of the beginning of the war.
The following research on space science appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystvo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the issue of society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of “Problems”, which contains four extensive articles on astronauts.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotović proposed the organization of a society that would engage in cosmonauty.
At that time, man-made satellite projects were already in motion, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Society (POA) has tried to join the international federation of Astronautics (based in 1951), and by the fall of the PAA it has become a valid member.
And next year, Kazizz Zrankevic, the first President of POA, was Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PAA has contributed significantly to the development of the very successful RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorogiczna), which was the first Polish missile to carry out scientific research.
The first type of PM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
A missile capable of reaching a distance of 1,800 metres was about 80 cm long and had a weight of less than 5 kg.
An improved RM-1A version was subsequently built, and in the summer of 1959, a two-tiered PM-2 rocket was tested on the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to perform this scientific work, the PM-34 rocket could pass 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM-type rocket was inherited by a Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed to be two-tiered, with a total length of 510 cm and a primary weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were different in size for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket was 0.4 l, the Meteor-1B had 0.34 l and the Meteor-1C had 0.62L.
The maximum flight range of all three types was 37 km.
During the period between 1965 and 1968, the Méteor II missile was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor II rocket, with a start weight of 380 kg, was able to extract a useful weight of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Later, version IIN and Metheor-3 were built.
Reference should also be made to Poland ' s accession to COSPAR (the Space Research Committee) in 1960 and to the establishment of the National Committee of COPAR two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermasevsky became the second intercosmonautian after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The decision generated a lively discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberalized economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is linked to the principle of free trade and free and unfettered private capital movements, together with unfettered financial speculation.
The significant difference in the cost of the labour force(s) results in price tension.
This notion needs to be understood to mean the condition that a producer, through the delivery of cheap goods, tries to resist economic competition by “stabilizing” the value of a competitor to take up most of the market and thus increase his own income.
On a large scale, this means that most entrepreneurs either move overseas production or have low-cost purchases abroad or disappear; this means increasing unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to others.
As private capital has no social responsibility, including its unemployment, the necessary costs of the State for social services have increased.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of business leaders to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social and social damage they have suffered in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to produce specific statistics.
Dedicated private capital methods create situations at the economy level of individual States where national Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments put private capital on their own, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the legislation in force.
The aim is to make their people economically subject to the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of prolonged unemployment and, at the same time, serves as a tool for reducing the rights of workers in the labour law.
As a result, poverty levels are increasing, but the difference between the poor and the rich is also increasing.
For several years, the FWG has had a public distribution of food to poor people who are unable to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of these people is approaching one million.
As the German economy improves its competitiveness, there are continuing instances where employed people receive such wages that the State must pay them to receive an subsistence minimum.
This scandal has also become known to the public in the case of additional Bundestag workers.
Economic measures in virtually all of the southern EU States are no doubt the same as when people who are under the pressure of a catastrophic social decline are either forced to emigrate, as was the 19th century, or to live on a poor salary in the backs of society in the hope that some day private investment will come.
However, ask where he will come from.
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African is still working for the share of European wages.
This is the case in Latin America as a whole.
The liberal theory and the media before the towelship argue that a State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the State should not be in charge of acting to interfere in the economy.
Further, the question should not be asked whether private capital, now practically political and that whole State, is operating for its own selfish purposes.
An unequivocal answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of practically omnipotent and omnipresent lobbyes in all States.
As a result, we have an unprecedented situation of corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where virtually all are deserving of punishment, but which is not a crime.
In the FARF, the situation is such that State ministries, owing to lack of financial resources, are tasked with drafting bills to private legal firms that are closely linked to industry.
These bills then confirm the Bundestag.
All power is not from the people, as the Western-type constitution says, but from the financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberalized democracy is now rapidly emerging in the situation described by Appiana in the “Crime crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompeii”: “The State has long been falling apart and agencies have been engaged in violence.
Hosts, illegal receipt of mercy by means of stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished, and people went to elections with a pre-soldened voice"...the order of the people did not run for the position of ruler at all, but eventually the State for eight months was left without a consul." "It was seriously starting to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is the self-power and the need to choose an energetic person."
As in ancient times, today ' s societies are dominated by their own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is no longer intended to be used for public purposes.
The present outcome is not different from the past: the wasteless fall of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes is that we must find ourselves in the reckless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be regarded as a certain pause, followed by the next round.
At the outset, it is tragic that the present elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with the crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a decision, or at least not permanent.
Under pressure from competition at both international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
The trend is thus systemic in nature.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s ownership of the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the administration of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"The violence won't go out and can never come out" -- The Sing, the "Mighty" song, where the main poem of the riffet is, "Don't forget how fragile we are."
"Had my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't have been" -- the dying Hutel Schneper, the wife of Meyer Amshel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated many reactions.
Some stand in favour of Israel, arguing that it is entitled to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue this racism of the Israeli State, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel attaches itself to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not wish to reflect on who, in these recurrent waves of murder, is a criminal and who, after all, are the victims of today ' s Israeli citizens, including self-governing territories, born at the time of the current political situation, and who have not witnessed the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the curtain, to see who is primarily serving 95 years of tension (reading from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my discussions are backed by historical facts, some by my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
That is not so clear whether these people have always taken their own steps, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to the intended goals.
It should be assumed that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the emerging power of money could not have occurred in one generation.
One of the astronomically rich families that could be considered the head of a spinach (I don't know if someone is above them, but it's not excluded) is Rothschilds.
We don't write a lot about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reyters) they had already purchased in the 1990s to end rumours that linked their name to criminal acts in the higher spheres in which they were present and which had always led to the strengthening of their power, to increase their wealth, or to both.
They have large stocks in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries whose central banks do not have their share, they are conducting or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, 5 countries, after the overthrow of Kaddafi, but at the same time the Russian Government has taken its central bank into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to oppose this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to remain a central bank for the Rotschild Bank of America, he began to issue his own (underground) money during the civil war, and was killed in 1865 at the theater.
John F. Kennedy started issuing his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve) system in 1963.
Their desire for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan for the three world wars created by Albert Pyke, the 33rd-level masson.
The purpose of the first war was to destroy monarchic States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (so many slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), the establishment of a single universal religion (ecumenism could not be anything other than a prerequisite for such a project) and the eventual seizure of absolute power.
The method used by a group of the richest families headed by Rothschilds is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent supply of solutions (order ab Chao - the order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and have always led to a deterioration of the situation (see the basis of FED, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis they had caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unleash the First World War by killing the Gobsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia by starting a Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended in a sudden, military- and economic-provocated capitulation of Germany (not at all the need for war to destroy the king's Russia), and as a result the Central European State, Austria-Hungary, was disbanded.
To facilitate the deployment of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation that imposed huge military reparations on Germany, rather than creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the depleted masses, then remained only to cast the Germans into a strong enough force, expose the perpetrators and propose a simple decision, to further establish a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that was to play, and actually played the function of a fifth column in fuelling the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rotschild provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one of which had sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (re-entry to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfura declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews in Palestine and began the initial clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have taken place on both sides.
World War II broke out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had come out of the chains in which he had originally held the bankers, or what he had done was planned, in any case, to suffer the European Jews in concentration camps, had created the prerequisites for recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations in the 2nd world war, the State of Israel was proclaimed to form the start of the third war.
If international bankers were able to untie it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, would be a victim of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, simply speaking, the Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country but also at the international level (only a sharp division of people into Israeli supporters and opponents).
Who is to blame and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the insults result in an endless chain of violence if it all begins with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
It is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we do, international bankers are giving people an opportunity to vote in elections exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascist, loyal international political bankers, making every effort to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran ' s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), would threaten to develop into a world conflict, while taking into account Iran ' s control over the Strait of Ormuz, which contained 20 per cent of the world ' s oil reserves (a shipping corridor of only 2 miles wide), would also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light is now the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
The new world order in which they represent them is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocratics enjoying comfort.
A world in which each child is implanted by a chip at birth, with which it becomes an entity under total control.
“And it makes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves have a brand on their right hand or on their forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, cannot buy or sell.
The wisdom of wisdom is that anyone having a mind can determine the number of animals.
For it corresponds to a human name, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
The "Argo Operation" filter: When the worst is not good, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic student demonstrators captured the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
They had to be released in exchange for the destroyed cock of Mohammed Reza Pehlev, who had fled after the American revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not expected -- it could not afford to throw its neck overboard, because that might have undermined the trust of allies in other countries.
However, to secure the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to a theocratic regime, it was not in a position to do so.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to release hostages by force.
The prisoners were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations facilitated by the Government of Algeria.
Their fate has generated a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran has contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended in Ronald Reagan's election.
The film by actor Ben Afflek “Argo's operation” describes one of the episodes of the story that brought little victory to America.
Not long before the Embassy, six employees had escaped.
They finished their journey to the Canadian Embassy ' s residence after the difficult peripeii.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to collect them from Iran, and assisted in an extraordinary cover story that said that they had left on Canadian passports as members of a survey team who had sought a place to survey the science and fiction epidemic in the country.
Gendarmes Co-ordinating
The plan that the evacuation expert, Tony Méndez, had developed, required Hollywood's cooperation.
For a legend to be reliable, specialized magazines were written about the draft of the film , press conferences were held, and the fabricated manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Méndez.
Affleca's film is a special combination of several gendarmes.
On the one hand, there's a real political trill, the so-called "fim kinoopus", a success story, a series of films about Ousena's friends can be an example.
In the film, mood swings change - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (significant historical photographs of events are shown in the captions, and how the same situations were shown in the film -- no difference.
On the other hand, alloyed by the needles of the Woods, which overlap with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - the men in the costumes discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, at the stairs of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Affleka did a great job recovery.
The derision actor became a respected director, and his game ceased to be the target of ridicule.
Argo operation of his third full-time film, followed by a dark detective, Goodbye, Baby, Goodbye (2007) and a troller, Gorod (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Affleka movie not being filmed in the home city of the director - Boston.
The feeling of a place's atmosphere, however, refers to the qualities that led to earlier film by the director over the Hollywood standard.
And Afflec does that in Argo where Tehran's "play" is Canada.
The best scenes in the film are happening on the streets, and in the reconstruction of real events, the introductory scenes of the Embassy's fall are impressive, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and surprises that arise when history changes somewhere suddenly.
The apparent effect of Afflec and its colleagues is achieved in the scenarios of the counterfeit (substantial headquarters at the Teheran market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative did not imply the many exciting scenes of film-based significance.
He's working quite successfully with this little guy, sometimes thinking something -- it doesn't come out as elegant as that -- the place where the phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at Tehran airport, and the run on the airstrip looks quite inflammable.
The disadvantage of Argo is the dissension associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, as the Hollywood colleagues, are truly fascinating, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleca's film lacks some dramatism, and it's a film that can be seen with moderate interest, evaluating the production and the retro-villion of the seven-tenths.
But it's hard to take.
This, however, is enough to remind you of one, still in the known sense of living history, and also of how exaggerated the perceptions of all-powerful and all-know intelligence services are.
Rules for ballooning, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovniplaty.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, now decided to declare a competition for “the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop”.
“We have moved this latest development, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies” stated “Rivu” as the organizer of the questionnaire Patrick Nager.
The recent decision of the European Court of Justice to pool the rates of insurance contributions for men and women was among those already put forward.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
“The most incredible ideas in the EU workshop can be put forward by people before the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU dispute orders include, for example, mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, resulting in damage to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury-points only because they contain a relatively small number of hazardous substances, or a chicken cell size directive, which has led to substantial travel of eggs this year.
The fact that the term “method oil” was actually banned or classical lamps were removed from the sale was also criticized.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European machinery often makes a decision under pressure from a trade or industrial lobby whose position in Brussels is usually protected by a State or a group of States (so Czechia is now at risk even to the veto defending the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, higher quality bananas in the European Union were to reach a length of 14 cm without being able to show anomalous.
However, the European Commission was justified by the fact that it only harmonized the existing fragmented national rules, which made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the opposition of some States, had still mitigated the standards of fruit and vegetables, noting that existing directives would lead to the waste of products.
The EU’s last year’s decision that the balloons sold must be warned that children under the age of eight cannot be exposed without the care of adults.
The EU has asked American studies to say that balloons in the game are a potential cause of death for children by suffocation.
Such a restriction is now applicable to children up to 14 years of age, which are forbidden to blow into nuclear arcs.
Sore ideas can be born at home.
The rule concerning European officials is somewhat absurd: everyone holding a official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic to Greece, use the name Macedonia, but rather say “BURM” (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovníposty.com portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists of the “Ininterference principle” (Laissez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to a few of the absurd rules mentioned above, for example, the EU rule on the level of food stock in the territory of a member State.
The EU has established a maximum level of food supplies that may be present in the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, its fixed quantities of canned mushrooms, for which it was subject to a high fine.
The interviewers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for their lack of sea and the idea of granting subsidies for the grant application.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are in a disadvantaged position because we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation,” declared the then Minister of Agriculture, Yaroslav Palace (PPPS) in autumn 2004.
He argued that there had been a high crop of grain in the country and, as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had a full stock warehouse that had to be removed.
For being far away from ports, the EU, according to Palau, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing tenders for grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for the grant were offered by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Germanz (US-DEU), in particular, to make applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Competing Orders are exceptions
While regulations in member States are easily criticized, EU regulatory efforts, as well as the European Union ' s more efficient functioning and development, are seen by many as meriting recognition.
In the opinion of the experts, drawing on EU contributions for projects that do not even have a hint for European integration is a serious problem, but have been achieved by Member States in their budget discussions.
The Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products and, as in other countries, has not always won the competition.
Although Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians retained the title "Olomopic raw materials," but "The Tusemi rum", the tradition of which is rooted in our country in the 19th century, our producers were supposed to be renamed "Tuzeak".
Only the products of the dystilite, rather than the sugar beet, may be called rum.
The official list of registered EU products, along with well known cheeses of “feta” and “gorghondsol”, marcipan of German Lubeka or perfumed ham, has already been found, for example, carlovards, peacocks and trisebons, and a Jatetzmel.
The trade mark of the EU may also be proud of paedobin and peacock tubes.
People want me to choose a republic, but I'm a lover,
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to the head to run for the presidency?
I don't think I'm going to be the senator or the president myself.
If there were no problems in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer see a country breaking out over the past 20 years as thieves, taxes and pension age are being raised.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution.
And since I am 40 years old and I am an independent person who is not in any party, I have no other way to influence things except to run for senator or president.
You went to the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Are you turning your back in this way to the people who chose you?
I always said I'd be involved in the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later on, I explained that if I were to be chosen as a senator, I would run for the President.
My goal is not to hold a position, a post is a tool by which I can carry out my views.
So I need the most influence and the widest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we, as a nation, rush at our bar or on TV, are ready to melt anyone who tries to change something.
This is added to the media, which glorifies people, and which confounds freedom of speech with freedom of deception.
For example, I was told that I was bribing journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irgi Paroubek.
Let's go to your eyes.
The struggle for the presidential castle has begun with the theory of political material and criminal responsibility and reverse property declarations above 20 million.
To do so, a change has to be made.
You do not have such powers as president, and only a whole Senate can offer laws.
How do you want to do this?
When I lobbied for a tour to become a free enterprise, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics -- when someone comes up with a good offer on the left or right, he is deliberately faced with obstacles, and that deters citizens.
As an independent stateless person, I have a much greater potential for receiving support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country without party grafting, and without looking at the dogmas.
You think you're more of a human being, more of a right or a left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that I am more of a left-wing person.
It doesn't matter to me at all. A little left or a little to the right.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It's not about someone on the right, but someone on the left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society whether it will be proposed by the HR Committee or the GBP, and I will certainly be opposed to the bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're populist.
But do you not prove that by what you said?
When you're creating a business plan for a firm, you also have some kind of perfect goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to try to get closer to.
You might call it a populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already in operation in the world, or some eminent experts are talking about them.
But you won't have the support of Parliament. You'll only have slogans.
That's why you won't hold on to politics.
Or do you think that when you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to assume criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any other opportunity.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them to our side so that we can achieve ours.
If I had been elected President, there would have been no problem in organizing a live television broadcast, in which I have appealed to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
If they refuse, they will have to explain why they do not want to.
If there was a strong personality that would be abused, pressure could be put on the political scene.
Directly electing the President was a matter of public pressure.
I'm telling you directly that I'm a lover, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I'm just beginning in politics, and for my programme, I'm going to try to get majority support.
I'm trying to make progress on my own; if it doesn't work, I'll end in six years and return to the private sector.
It sounds a lot like Okamura has to save Czechia.
I'm not a lifeguard.
I know I'm not going to do anything, so I've bypassed a number of famous people to run for the Senate.
I went to Radma Yanchur, he refused because of the heavy workload.
I also at least supported the leading investigation by journalist Jan Lorenzosov, who opened up the fraud with light petroleum products.
I have put forward my candidature because people are really not, but now I feel I'm on the balance.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, and most of the people who chose to be representatives of the crescent.
Only two of us are independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate to make changes difficult.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to test the purity of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money to pay for it.
No money, no presidential campaign, only twenty thousand crowns on my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You speak of declaration of property, and what about your own deeds?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague with a value of about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, an art collection of approximately 10 million, Estonia-Martin by 3.5 million, and Scoda Superb by a million, and a few million by that.
By the way, Aston-Martin came into my head because it was my little dream -- I always liked James Bond, who was driving, he was a galanine with women, and he was fighting against the vagrancy and lawlessness.
You go to Aston Martín, own some 60 million property, and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've been in the campaign for 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign from my pocket.
The campaign costs to me will essentially cover the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't have lived on that money, for example, could've paid my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If only I wanted to earn money, I wouldn't go anywhere.
So you're going to do business next time, so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut that down?
But that doesn't depend on the wage.
As I promised, I was partially reduced.
For example, my deputy will be the manager of the tourism agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a scavenger who's going to keep the republic.
But I have something to live for, too.
How much, as an apprentice, did you get on a monthly basis?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get further away.
And if I were to become president, my entrepreneurship would have ended.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday in The Right.
MVRDV architects have proved that the actual connections are not only in imagination - in the case of Speykennis and his recently built Mount - 2 photographs
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, at last we can see something interesting again," says Lizette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a nearby large enterprise, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I'm asking myself, why do we need another library today?
Everybody has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to such old-fashioned libraries on a voluntary basis now, right?
Speykennise, a small sleeping garden near Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this sadity, several years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven constructed bridges, which are painted on euro bills, in the form of painted minisoteton minis.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the city's fathers realized that they had the only opportunity to win the statistics: build a library here!
Maas from the MVRDV rotterdam architectural office, the master of bold column diagrams, and the grotesque, sometimes cynic, assigned to his usual insanity and appeared on a competitive audition in 2003, with five books under his arm and his face.
And while the members of the jury looked around and began to shake their shoulders, the imperceptive Maas removed from his original pyramid gift and concluded in defense of his project with the words, "Glorious citizens."
This is it, my offer, "The Mountain of the Book" in Speykennis, the so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, valued at 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of a rehabilitation project, which also includes underground garages, supermarkets, mail, and several residential homes and tungstens for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, "The Mountain of the Netherlands" was awarded the second award of the 2012 Lower Library.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Wood Plant Competition.
Thus, a small suburb, which had previously been unable to offer anything other than the post-moderist pedestrian zone and the remarkably beautiful town hall, with its white fronts being thought of as milkwater, has become richer for one modern architecture.
But the most important thing is that in Spain, the first public building in the history of this town was the public building of cultural use.
The Long Road to a Book
First impression: the book Eldorado under a cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the center of the mountain range, because the real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore the area on foot.
Refrigerated room on all sides - light and light light, burning bricks, and elegant street lamps provide a sense of public urban area.
The urban environment is perfectly restored.
The eyes are quietly looking for benches, dogs and football boys and girls.
And everywhere there are books, books, books.
"Of course the bookshelves stand along the front of the fascist, and in the middle, there is a large dark hall, which is usually unsurpassed and inflexible," says Vini Maas.
We've put the classic space configuration on our head and pulled out the outside reading area.
The inner space of the book Mountain has been used skillfully, with offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities in the center.
The black bookshelves that serve as the separation of the wall, the parapets, and the flattery.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even skilled architects and builders are lost in speculation, which is unknown material.
“We have sought to work with secondary materials”, explains Yopp Traubest, the project manager of the Speykeniss community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once again, at one agrarian enterprise in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in the heat and in the fields of the Netherlands, artificial fibers of millimetre thickness have been used as substrates.
It's cheap and time-saving.
Tight textiles serve one or two seasons, and can then be thrown out.
For the library, this is a canvas -- for the first time in these volumes -- has been compressed into panels four centimeters thick.
The so-called Landbaoplast (KLP) is turned by heat and pressure into dark, homogeneous, solid material, the smell of a little like a new car, and some sneakers.
There are 105 steps at the top.
Those who overcome the path of nearly 500 meters will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with fantastic vistas on the city but also with Dutch sharps and wood figs in their attics.
They care about the atmosphere, especially the proper humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs per New Soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is an environmental model project," says Troubest.
The heat of the earth is used for heating and cooling.
Although the book Mountain is under a glass cap, even in bright days the sun falls into the sun for only a short time.
Large - scale glued farms, located perpendicularly in a glass front, provide shades and take on most of the sun’s rays.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic steering curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above as an IT skeptic, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verhaig was also here.
As well as a teacher in traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bozard, who called Bukenberg “the spirit of Speykenice, which has long been lacking”.
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to contribute a book from his own congregation.
These books were to be occupied with empty spaces on the shelves of an uncompleted library -- at the time, there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The Poles have trust.
"There's nothing worse than a half a library," says architect Vini Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, each resident is now somehow linked to this new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of that building.
Even if it serves only for jewelry.
Thus, the MVRDV has succeeded in solving the royal task of creating identity in a professional jargon.
Speykennis wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for identifying it.
Or, "The Germans have a more important role to play."
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, the US - European liaison expert, in doing so, Berlin balances on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the voting.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany must now be cautious about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position does not support it either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
Germany also abstained in the voting during the March 2011 revolt in Libya on the imposition of the no-flight zone.
As a result, NATO made this offer.
Is Germany difficult to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, moving from a policy that, so to speak, was ruled by the United States to German foreign policy itself.
The fact that Europeans do not have a coherent unified policy further complicated the situation.
So the Germans are getting back between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're only finding their part so far, but they're on the way to "more normal" foreign policy.
This foreign policy is being pursued by France or Great Britain.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
This will be a national commitment, regardless of the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, exports and links to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests were significantly different from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore protect its own interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets for marketing in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to offend the public and elites in Arab countries.
Either way, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't give it too much importance, it's not entirely a unilateral connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German calculations.
Did Germany harm its relationship with the United States by refraining from important decisions such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, understanding of German position prevails.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan issue.
Germany may even acquire some respect.
It signalled that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that it should be considered in the interest of the player.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the US has clearly spoken for the veto.
Is there a difference between the US and many European States?
Because of American domestic policies, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has a good understanding of the European position in its heart.
But, of course, because of the local political situation, the Government cannot take such a stand openly.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not happy about Netanyahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of an important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes a situation so difficult for Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be a little easier if there was a one-size-fits-all European policy, but it's not that right now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are forced instead to act solely on their own vision.
That's how they come from the euro.
I think Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position in the future.
Clearly, it is not easy for Germany, at least because of relations with Israel.
It's always been hot.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany itself saw itself as an important international player, would it not really take the primary role?
Or is Germany still difficult to lead?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to this, is still in trouble to this day, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a significant role.
For example, the euro crisis -- every time Germany takes on an important role -- manifests a wide range of anti-German feelings.
The Germans are not simply allowed to cope with this.
In fact, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this perspective, Germany is in a much worse position than the United States.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and views, and that is not easy.
So, the influence of the U.S. in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this vacuum, then who is left?
The Germans just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's unpleasant, or it's the kind of life that makes you dislike it.

"Claim of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-known trademark, and Polo Ralf Lauren is also.
But what's Armani Polo?
It is an entirely officially registered name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from which it was formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the reference names file a claim.
Even then, it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“Foreigners are increasingly finding it difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, attorney for Taylor Wesing, specializing in the violation of trademark rights in the Far East.
There's a new case like this coming on my desk every week.
Only a few letters are sufficient to be added to obtain the right to register their trademarks.
So Gucci gets Lu-Gucsi, and instead of Prada, Prada can register Prada-Kny.
German enterprises, such as the Puma sports manufacturer, are legally copied in the same way.
Matth opens a folder with the trademark department's records in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company registered a trade mark for Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also uses the name of the fashion home Ermegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are the world champions for copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities, there are multi-story unveiled coals that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
However, Patloha ' s cases are not the same, and upon instructions from its supporters, he opposes that Chinese enterprises have the right to use a name that has already been protected elsewhere officially from the trademark department.
The Chinese call it a minpai, a brand passenger.
This word is associated with the Ban Ducuan.
This is what women call hunting for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not accept guilt
"It harms business; it must be fought," Pattlach is convinced.
"The road mark is blurring, the unique situation is being lost, the image is suffering greatly."
The financial and procedural costs of the affected industries are estimated to be millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, with a sales of 15 billion euros a year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to achieve the removal of doubtful records in the trademark registry, and this is costly.
The process may last for up to nine years, with a vague outcome.
Pattlach talks about cases in which the court rejected claims because after a long period of time, the challenged name became “the reality of the market”.
If the claimant is not fortunate, he'll even have to pay the replicator because he's damaged his trademark in China, says Pattlach.
Sometimes there's a law of the jungle.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a judicial dispute with a construction manufacturer, Sany, a company that had recently acquired a company called Putzmeist concretes.
Thus, the Chinese still have the right to use an icon similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo purchasing company, Gayly, initially used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW; it was a successful process, and Geely had to change it.
Locoste, a fashionable commodity manufacturer, played in China for simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore, with the famous crocodile watching in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The registration of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in meeting the needs of staff and facilities in 2010.
But last year, there was “a return from emergency to normal”.
Thus, the number of pending objections cases fell by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
Nevertheless, claims are still pending production within the agency.
Coping With This Costly
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year CTMO received more than 1.4 million claims for the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has, for a tenth consecutive time, run a list of new registers worldwide, reporting to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trade signs, only 5.5 million grand.
In 2011, $1.8 billion of dues were paid.
If simplified, it means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 Yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth many times more to protest, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, it has been fighting against a Chinese plagiar.
The Germans have succeeded in eliminating their illegal manufacture of counterfeit autos.
However, the simulator attached Chinese trading rights to the Freudenberg mark.
This was a failure, since the names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Wentsler, president of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO Trademark Registration Department rejected the Munichian claim.
It is true that both of the following Freudenberg authorities have won, but the opposing side has continued to fight.
We need to be clear.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentsler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the court's professionalism.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive, and it takes us a lot of time, money, and nerves."
The internal costs are unlikely to be accounted for, and the company has had to examine even the acts of centuries old to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a “greater of six-digit Euros for settlement.
"It's clear how much we're worth," says Wentsler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even Europe.
It is in the event that unprotected trademarks are registered with the simulators.
For example, a Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The concert had long ceased production in those areas, but it had been able to prevent registration.
"We have to be a piece," says Ventsler.
Both he and counsel for Pattloch recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks, but aliens should “all that is worth protecting in any way, to be registered also in China”, says Ventsler.
Otherwise, it could cost a lot more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the other party license fees for his own name, explains Ventsler.
Otherwise, we're driven out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Marking, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing, and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are happy to do so.
The history of relations over a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
First, cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies’ boats, and men’s caps pick up taxis on the fence floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly build up, the alt, the bass, the tenor and the soprano, and they come and charm and follow one another.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his mother's shoes when he leads them with flexible and vivid gestures.
Monday night, at the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg Chore Imbongi rehears a new song.
Fifty - five members of the choir, between 23 and 69 years of age, came from a human genetic expert to a nobleman.
"Om Obani" is a difficult thing, every voice of the choir has its own text, and in a very strange language: the Zulus, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
According to the Unaids assessment, the United Nations AIDS programme has estimated that there are about 34 million people living with HIV in the world.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the HIV-positive population is supported.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitgeni, the Voices for Africa has been found as chiefs in Germany.
Of these, 70 attend school for further training.
At 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the bossy.
It guarantees money to the child for school, school uniform and daily hot lunch at the Gogo Centre.
Imbong in Zulu means a storyteller or an admirer.
They don't talk to the bants in this room, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the chorus has been singing in that foreign soft language, and from time to time, it even brings them back to where they first appeared — south of Africa.
After all, 873 miles [8,733 km] from Heidelberg, north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, lies the village of Esitgeni, which depends on the voice of the German choir.
Infected 40 per cent
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay huts and straws, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who had died of the HIV virus.
The disease throughout Swaziland - the highest HIV infection rate, the world ' s lowest life expectancy according to UNICEF, is reflected in Esitgeni.
Men's excision, which has proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland ' s population was infected with the immunodeficiency virus, and death was not rare in the middle of the fourth tenth.
Hor opened the village in a joint visit to Africa in the spring of 2005, but first the people of the Imghan saw a large number of children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but also simply food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
It was first a private commitment by individual participants to send the child to school a few euros a year and to allow him to receive hot meals once a day.
But after a year, the choir founded the Voices for Africa, which has been almost professionally concerned with AIDS orphans in Esitgeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonoria) are considered bacterial ACPs.
HIV, the human papilloma virus, the genetic herpes and hepatitis are frequent viruses.
The lubricular pedicosis and scabies are among the parasitic STIs.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly among men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koha Institute is of the opinion that at least four out of every five Cifilis registered in Germany are transmitted by sexual intercourse between men.
Heterosexual adults often have sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamymic infections, trichomoniasis, candosis (grunch), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
We have a relatively low prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamidoid infections are much more common than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also often have a human papilloma virus among young people.
How do the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
Syphilis morbidity, according to the Robert Koha Institute, has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is approximately one tenth less than the previous year.
What are some symptoms that indicate venereal disease?
Infectious diseases may involve signs of genetics, complaints of urination, discovery, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, as well as bubbles or sealing.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain or other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you be protected?
Preservatives can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
In fact, part of the causes of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by means of contact infections and through close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend a regular examination, especially with regard to the frequent sex shift.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid remote effects.
The police, the donations and, not least, the honors of the choir's performance throughout Germany allow for something to be gathered.
"All of us have sent to Esitgeni for about 200,000 euros," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, German money is managed by a conscious and active woman.
She also sees to it that orphans are well organized, such as one of her grandmothers.
Gogos, according to the Zulu older women, is the village’s support.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads, and take care to ensure that their children appear in uniform every day in class.
Those who don't have any family come to the shelter of Hanysil, a single woman receiving a salary from the union, as well as two cooks who prepare each day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a Swedish school, built two chickens, and jointly with the American Health Organization PSI organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefers to be very silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennarttz, "because it's connected to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country where the king has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch in black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of surpluses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-sanctioned lifestyle is also responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in previous years.
But it also rests on the wandering laborers who distribute the virus throughout the country.
Free condoms are found at literally every corner, says Annette Lennarttz, "but they're almost out of use.
Another culture is flesh."
To support the cultural exchange a little, Ibmonei Choir travels to southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs, clads, wary spirits, confidence and black self-awareness that many in the southern part of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing black songs -- this recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even happens to cause tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The journey is also always to Esitgeni, where the singers visit the children they wear.
Although a small village with difficulty can be found on a map, it is more known in the Etsulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitheni, there's light," the people of the world say.
And after the 8,733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when those drowning singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is burning here as well.
NASA opens the ice on Mercury
The Messinger Zone found evidence that there's ice on Mercury's planet.
Ice cover can be as thick as 20 meters.
NASA, the United States Space Agency, has proved the ice on the Mercure planet.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by the three studies published on Thursday in the special magazine Science.
The Messinger Zone has found evidence that the permanently undercover region of the world is covered by ice.
Its thickness must be at least 30 centimeters, possibly up to 20 metres.
Water is likely to come from comets or perhaps asteroids that have encountered Mercury.
No one links the opening of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader of probe Sean Solomon.
Mercury can have a temperature of up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life fell to other parts of the solar system.
Incomprehensible to the Earth's inhabitants, probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as "Penics," will explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: little eyes in endlessly giving.
The image is from a cell developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Cerera.
As was the case with Ptolemy, who looks around the Sun for Neptune, Cerera, by a new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, is not a “planet”.
This portion of the infrared telescope Spitzer represents the “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue, it is more difficult to identify in the star circle the pink "newborn" stars.
This region of star formation - scientists call it the W5 - opened by the Spitzer telescope in the Cassipea constellation, 6500 light-years away.
This inflammable heat of a dying star photographed NASA's Spice Telescope.
The nipple-like ring seems to consist of the material that the star dropped in the process of dying.
The giant trifid nebula, removed over 4,500 light-years from the Earth, produces new stars from the gas and dust.
NASA's Spicer telescope made this picture of a galactic maternity room.
The Starcillation of Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night by the naked eye.
Of course, the color is getting better with the telescope.
As the red eye blinks to the observer, the Vlast nebula nebulas in this infrared picture.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation of Vodola.
The approach to the Earth's continent brought that nebula with the name North America.
The combination of a normal and infrared photo is an outstanding color.
This new star was able to take a picture of the whole beauty only by using the infrared telescope Spitzer sensors.
Saturn and his ring: How they came about is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It's probably the fragments of Saturn's Moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the Hubble telescope, the Vavovert galaxy
Depending on the color transfer, spiral galaxies are transformed into actual works of art.
The images published by the European Observatory show a distance of several thousand light-years from the Trifid nebula in the constellation of Ströltz.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (three-long, three-separate) because the dark strips of dust are divided into three parts of the boneless heart of the stars.
In a constellation, the astronomers photographed the forebearer of a space collision: at 400 million light-years away from the Earth, the nucleus of two floating galaxies is facing each other and will inevitably face each other.
It's the birth of the Hubble telescope telescope that took off in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like the technical cuts might call it "South Circumcision Circle."
The image of the Hubble Space Telescope shows the fragment of the Iris nebula in the constellation of Cephe.
Nebula removed for 1,400 light-years consists of dust particles 10 to 100 times less than normal house dust.
This image was made of optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a black hole ring that is 430 million light-years away from the Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, photographed NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
The big spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This starry nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
Starship is constantly creating new stars.
It is a star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, which is also constantly creating new stars - at a distance of 5,000 light years from the Earth.
There's no dust in this bright, shining galaxy with a little black hole but gas.
The researchers assume that it arose shortly before the Big Bang, when hydrogen was mainly present in the universe.
Our views in the universe: critical telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608, by Hans Lippersgeem, even before Galileo began to monitor the stars a year later.
Since then, the optical telescope mirrors have become more and more and the view of the space is deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The star shown here was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope has been installed.
It allows you to look into space by means of two mirrors, each three feet [8.4 m] in diameter.
“Gran Telescopico Canarias” has a giant internal device, which is the diameter of a mirror alone of 10.4 metres.
The “Greater South African Telescope” in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs.
However, in diameter it is about 20 feet [11 m].
The lack of low-cost design: the telescope is rigidly attached under vertical angles, limiting its mobility.
The Hobbie-Aberley telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its characteristic is high light-sensing.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radar station in Aresio, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radar is 305 metres in diameter.
By participating in the Search Out of Mind (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing his computational power.
View of European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Andes of Chile
Here's "The Big Telescope", fully appropriate to its name.
His four mirrors provide a glimpse of even the medium infrared spectrum.
It is also planned to install the European Large Telescope.
Its main mirror should be a whole total of 42 meters -- and almost 1,000 mirror cells would be made up.
However, photographs should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes in the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors 10 meters in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, together with them, is also seen with the assistance of the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a diameter mirror of 30 metres, should appear on Mauna Kea.
Here they can enjoy illustrations.
However, the most important species from outer space supply the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it has provided pictures of the distant worlds.
Since March 2009, Capeler's space telescope has been looking for planets beyond the solar system, especially those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 planet candidates had been discovered since the start of the mission.
Photographs taken of the latest preparations of Kepler's Space Telescope.
James Webb (JWST)'s space telescope will be sent no earlier than 2018 on board Arian 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
One of the mission of the telescope is that it must look for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest there's ice in the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence of this, since Master is turning closer to the northern pole of the planet.
It has been shown that there is ice in Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messinger probe launched in 2004, the first one that revolves around Mercury, scientists are now confident of that.

Finding solutions in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
The trip through the Talish Mountains is a wild and romantic one.
The microbus is blown down the outback road by the thick forests of hills, windbrushes, and ordinary peasant houses.
It's so green and bright, it's like you're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost country of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is just a few kilometres away.
This is where the talishi live, one of the people of the Caucasus who know a little about, unless they speak perfectly to the Farsi and the Azerbaijanis and are different for a long time.
The end point is Larick.
The small town is huddled with the too heavy architecture of the Soviet era, which is completely out of harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Travelers from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too exhausting.
It takes eight hours to reach 323 miles [323 km], as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes oil to the Caspian Sea is here in the province before it comes.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is something in Lérica that would interest tourists.
"In May Baku, we're famous for the European song festival, and next year we're going to have the festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulaeva.
She's the director of the Long Years Museum, probably the only one in the world.
Some eight dozen of these more than 100 years old have been documented, and Fatulaeva points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At 136 years of age, he had another child.
But the disputed star of the museum is the Chiraly Muslumov Chaban, who is said to have reached 168 years of age.
No birth certificates, however.
In view of the fact that an older person whose age has been confirmed by documents was 122 years old, the age of Muslumov is extremely doubtful.
“He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973”, Fautulaeva explains.
The man was married three times and he had 23 children, and at 136 years of age he allegedly had a daughter.
Did the chaban Muslumov add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholtz, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostok, heard about the long-term residents in Central Asia.
“Very many people of preeminent age can also be found in some parts of China, Japan, or the Junza Valley in Pakistan,” said Scholtz, “Sardinia is also living an extremely large number of very old people.
However, owing to the lack of documentation, age was not possible because there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of pickled oil
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the Leurik area are often at the age of the Bible.
Today, 20 people are over 100 years of age.
Why are so many long-term people here in the south?
Azerbaijan's tour guide, Farid Mugimzad, explains this by the special Talysh's genes.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the other hand, believes that he has food.
Talyes love meat, bread and most milk, and many of them drink to a glass of poplar oil every day, but it is unlikely that such a high-caloric diet can be healthy from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it in the original way of life, which preserves the youth of mankind, in Changemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerick, where Rubab Mirzoeva lives.
At 97 years of age, it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims that she has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter that she can't get up to and over.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of the sons and daughter of Miraeva, who have their grandchildren for a long time.
There's two kids coming in too.
In the kitchen the guests prepare the tea that is served in the typical umbilical glass of the armud.
Mirzavo has perfectly straight and strong white teeth, underneath her head covering the long dark red hairs that her son proudly opens to us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so they never drop and keep color.
"And I've never used a shampoo," Mirzaev says.
Monthly pensions are life-saving
She always ate only things that grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought food in a store in my entire life.
She then tells of her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after the Second World War.
But it got better when Heir Aliyev's "love father" got into the steering wheel.
Propaganda doesn't often sound like an old woman's talk.
However, the cult created around the father of a nation, which ruled as a dictator in Azerbaijan, little or no longer knows the boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, followed by the opposition of his son, Ilham.
However, there was no poverty among Azerbaijani elderly people.
230 manats (equivalent to the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives monthly pensions, for local conditions this is the amount for which good living can be achieved.
And perhaps the long-standing son of Mirzaeva is also right, "The people of our culture have deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happiness.
That there's no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human rights” is missing in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Controversial demonstrations in Cairo testify to the deep divisions of the country.
The future Constitution, based on the Shariah, met with violent opposition.
The Egyptian president did not buy a paphos.
We have to make a move.
"And his success lies on my responsibility to the people and to the God," he said on the television.
His speech was directed to the entire people, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, educated Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
For all of them, who are still hopelessly divided in the broken opposition, are fearful.
Fear of a religious state in the Nile on the mercy of powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohammed Murcia, almost sorry, said that he had temporarily cut the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his jurisdiction “to save the revolution”.
But what really wants to do is to save 61-year-old engineers with a doctorate degree in the United States University of South California, not very clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were able to pass through the night in a 15-hour jump which prevented Islamist groups from being formed by a 100-part constitutional meeting, which was in part a source of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the legal system is based on “principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use vague language and the legal lout for a more rigorous interpretation of the Sharia.
At least one new article suggests this: in all cases concerning the Shariah, the Council of the University of Al-Ahar, the country ' s most important Islamist institution, with great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be involved.
This should not, but could mean that the clergy were looking over the law, that de facto would have resulted from a limitation of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, much is interpreted
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians in military courts must be maintained.
These courts, during Mubarak ' s period of power, served to suppress oppositioners.
After the dictator ' s overthrow, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military detention.
It also states that the State must protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “support its morality and values”.
This is so vaguely worded that public institutions can use this article to control even the content of movies and literature.
This means that the open text does not mean that it is censorship.
In general, no article directly establishes equality between men and women.
But others forbid the prophet Muhammad and his messengers to be slandered.
But what is wrong, and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
It is also doubtful what is forbidden “injury”.
Is there enough cartoons for a president or a storyteller joke?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this draft that Murcia offers for signature, “very soon” will be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The Revolution Has Returned."
For several weeks, there has been an opposition to the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people met in unusual consensus on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we shall win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former head of the international nuclear energy agency Mohammed ElBaradei stated that the draft constitution was “at the historical dump”.
Through his short Twitter service, he accused Morse's supporters of wanting to lead a road against democracy.
"If he declares the referendum, we shall go to his palace and cast it down," said oppositioner Yasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not falsified”, quoted Egyptian media as Khaled Ali’s opposition policy.
Many judges also indicated that they did not wish to observe the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"Coran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for a contrasting demonstration, but, out of caution, not on Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile before Cairo University.
A large number of women under the auspices of the Salatians were present, crying out: “The people require the application of God's law”.
They said, "Coran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which everything began triggered a state of virtually civil war.
Murcia’s followers apparently did not want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution were loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide from the ballot box in which the country should go.
Most of the project of Islamists, this is considered to be the case.
“The term `human rights' is never mentioned”
Hafis Abu Saeda was furious with this formal constitutional process, which was supposed to continue until February with the participation of all public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EPR) protected the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or brought before a court in Mubarak.
Not because he shared their vision, but because of the fact that human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
Now, the words "human rights" never appear in a new constitution, he regrets the discussion with Welt am Sonntag.
The expansion of Mursey's influence over all three branches of government in the State has disappointed the lawyer.
These measures represent clear attacks on the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“In order to strengthen the civilian State, the de facto President cancelled it”, said Saeda.
Indeed, without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even an international community, looking at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
A payment may come for that.
The demon on Tahrir Square warns, "You're creating a monster that you can't control."
Norwegian cancer: the stupidest fish in the world?
Norway ' s five million people have one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also throughout the world.
Perhaps the mystery of the country's success is somehow linked to the local passion for one highly caught fish?
Take a few stale pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll be able to smell a repulsive smell of cancer, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours off Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but there's an indescribable smell in the air.
Rockfisk is a trout with salt and water to a year, depending on what shower to make.
As the bags congregate and cool, Norwegian crowds gather for the Fágernes Festival, dedicated to this one, let's say, the catch-up dish.
"They eat raw food, and they fill in with a bag of aqueducts, a local dark hydrogen," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local firefighter in the profession and in the community of the "crackish general", who runs the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat a small - sized fish and drink it with a lot of drink.
"Some people like it more than cancer," said Havard.
This drink has the potential to overrun the smell.
I'm trying a couple pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not as bad as it is, it's very different from the amount of land you've been carrying on the bus for a long time.
Rockfisk is a Norwegian product from very different times, a time of poverty, when pre-enhancing refrigerators were covered in hermetically closed barrels of salt water.
Then the deep winter, when the fish had already given birth to the fish well and thoroughly, was taken away and became numbed by alcohol and consumed.
Remembering the past generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to flee their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly in the United States.
Now, more than 13 per cent of the population is growing rapidly, and more than 13 per cent of them are immigrants who have jobs, high wages and a well-developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (an old rival, a long and far-reaching neighbour) have come to work here.
Rockfiske is perceived as an important symbol, an immature, albeit somewhat vicious, element of the past of Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local foods.
On the other hand, you're going to need £9 ($14, U.S.).
Norway is rarely seen in the world ' s news, and the majority of the population seems to be doing so.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Brayvik, a racist and right-wing extremist, who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without reference to his name, the terrorist is referred to as "the incident of 22 July".
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peace-loving country, one of their fellow citizens has been capable of such atrocities and killings.
Norway ' s well-being today is based on the growth (from the beginning of the seventy) of one of the world ' s largest oil and gas industries.
"Just oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, our waitressing trays with a long, bright haired woman, and striking blue eyes, the translation of the Nordic well-being.
We are such a people as you call it - reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English beautifully.
We don't like showing up, we're not bragging.
Norway is very concerned about its oil, with most of the oil and gas revenues invested in a special fund created for future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone fell short of the money they did not have, Norway carefully counted the cost.
"As long as you can ride winter skis and walk in summer, it's enough for happiness," Anna says.
"And there's cancer," she adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in line in the snow for something to eat-- the cancer's enough for me.
Here, a hamburger with salmon meat, that's certainly exotic, that's delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening, we're going to have more of the same fish with the same smell as ever before.
At my hotel, there is a special meal devoted to the cancer, during which visitors vote on the best or perhaps the most aromatic fish.
There is a direct telephore that shows the leading bacon in a tier surrounded by a cancer plate.
It's like a song competition called "Eury."
So Tor-Jorgen, what is your estimate of the best fish in the mountains?
"Yes, Haward, this is our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off the wall, maybe taking over the acavitist.
Or maybe just smelling the fish.
The President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nieto, has a difficult career start.
While Mexico ' s newly elected President, Enrique Penya Nyeto, is preparing to take office, the BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his people.
The traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly deplorable state.
The city was loaded with transportation at a better time, and since Monday, steel fences had been built, cutting several key lines into the capital and causing road chaos.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work in the suburbs, but to prevent the protestors from reaching the seat of Parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nyeto, has given the presidency a link and has the courage to rule over the country.
He's faced with a challenge.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance in the Felice Calderon Administration, which now constituted its powers, but the country had lost some 60,000 lives in the war against drugs in six years.
“My Government expresses its readiness to the people of Mexico to fight violence”, Mr. Peña Nyeto, President of the United States, reported earlier this week to Barack Obama in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that objective.
Before such statements, alongside the President of the United States, Mr. Peña Nieto had developed as Governor of his hometown of Mexico City.
In his homeland, in a densely populated and vast state, surrounding the capital, views were divided about the new leader.
Straight-lined man
In Valle de Bruvo, an Idillian town, for example, is remembered with warmness.
Residents deserve to re-establish tourism, to develop the resort and to build infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which are strikingly different from the roads with the beans and pits that were previously in this area.
The tablets with his name will hang on a modern sports center building and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We share with him hope for real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman from Penya Nieto, the institutional revolutionary party (PIR).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that our country so urgently needs, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PIR party was expelled in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Oliver admits that, since his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos Presidential Palace, the party has high hopes for Enrique Penya Nieto.
He also refutes the allegations of irresponsibility made by the new President of the opposition.
It is very straightforward and very dedicated to the idea of a vision for the future of the country.
It's an excellent state figure, and most of all, a listening person.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The Municipality of Nesaualcootl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the paved streets of Valle de Bruvo.
Hidden beneath highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
The municipal problems are also severe.
In the past year, troops have been engaged to reconcile drug-trafficking gangs in those areas; violence against women is particularly acute here.
Several dozens of dead women ' s bodies have been found in the desert near an extensive landfill in the past two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico City during Mr. Peña Nieto's governorship, which far exceeds this figure in the notoriously notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name became a lot of absolved when it came to the murder of innocent women.
According to the opponents, Mr. Penya Nieto, at best, he was unable to deal with the killing of women during his tenure as governor.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A woman who lives in a concrete house like most of the houses in this spouting area, Irena Bundia, is struggling to contain tears by showing me photographs of her dead daughter, Mariana Moon.
According to the official version of Mariana, she committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believes that she was killed by a settler.
"When I got to her house, her body seemed washed," she recalls.
There were signs that she had been beaten and that her body had been closed.
The mother of Mariana translates this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs close to the crucifixion, which has only one word on it: justice.
That is what they said was denied to the family.
"The state's men treated me like an old gossiper, an unsatisfied peace violator.
They want people to just take on everything they say and give up.
But that's wrong, so you can't, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around you," she says.
On Saturday, President Penya Nieto will take on the heavy responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes, and the new President has promised to make this problem a priority during his administration.
“I hope he will be exactly the same President as the Governor,” says Oliver, a Valle de Bruvo congressman from the PRI party.
However, this is what most concerned the families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the ill-treatment, charges.
Prosecutors tried to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of poor detention conditions.
During the hearing, emphasis was placed on Manning's stay at the military prison in Kwangico, Virginia.
Protection requires that the case be closed on the grounds that the conditions of Manning ' s detention were cruel.
The U.S. Private Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that the private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not avail himself of the many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment that he claimed to have suffered while in military prison.
During a cross-examined pre-trial hearing in Fort Meid, Maryland, the Military Prosecutor, Major Ashden Feyn, stated that the records of the weekly visits to Manning by prison authorities in nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
Cross-examined in the context of the defence motion to terminate Manning ' s case, on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in itself sufficient punishment, was held the following day after Manning had said that he had intended to commit suicide while in detention.
Military Intelligence Analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of kidnapping several thousand sensitive documents during service in Iraq.
These material was subsequently published on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks resource failed to confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During the hearing on Friday, Attorney Feyn, together with Manning, reviewed reports that were completed after visits by the Manning Administration while he was in Kwantiko prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During their visits, prison officials asked Manningu questions and recorded his answers.
When Attorney Feyn asked on Friday about the reports, Manning admitted that he viewed himself as “extraordinary” by the prison administration and the general conditions of detention as “skilled”.
The reports under consideration do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was asked directly about the conditions of his detention, Feyn claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed its concerns orally and that those problems had been discussed with him by the Administration and that they would be dealt with in writing but not in writing.
"They wrote "no problem" (after my complaints were discussed), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring the subject up in the interview," said Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a meeting of a commission which had considered the joint intentions he had expressed in writing several months before.
Manning replied that during that meeting he had wanted to see to it that the regime of “injury prevention” was removed and that conditions of detention had been mitigated.
The military authorities explained that the limited prison regime, to a lower level than the self-indiction surveillance regime, had been introduced for the protection of the prisoner and for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the Administration know that everything is all right with me, that they're going to cancel the trauma prevention regime... that my level of life will improve, from my point of view," explained Manning.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a naval prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait and that he had lost consciousness once because of the heat.
He explained that it's very difficult when you're not allowed to know how you're doing and what's going on in the outside world.
"My world has gone to Camp Afrigian base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in that cage."
While in Kvantico, Manning, he said, spent most of the time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day -- all alone.
Manning reports that he was permitted to leave only his mattress, blanket, slits, and a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says that he tried to move because he had to sleep, or even lie, during the day - to - day period.
According to Manning, a light coming from outside his cell was constantly beating in his eyes during his sleep.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around in bed at night, he was said to have been woke up and forced to turn around.
Manning ' s counsel officially objected to the ill-treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manninga was transferred to military prison in Fort Liwenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during the testimony on Thursday that after he had been forced to sleep in his cell in Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners on an early examination.
Manning stated that it was not possible to cover the blanket during the inspection.
Replying to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the order of the guard that he should drop a blanket that he could hide, but admitted that no one had directly ordered him to leave.
On Thursday, Manning stated that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempts to show the officer that he did not pose a risk to himself.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could use a panties or slits to hurt himself, but didn't do it.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underclothes, slits and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to endure during his detention and would significantly reduce his detention if a military court found guilty of having to start trial at the beginning of the next year.
The defence stated that it planned to suggest that Manning be found guilty of less serious crimes, and that other charges be contested as excessive.
The resumption of the hearings is scheduled for the weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon states that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of persons under maximum security.
Among the charges made to Manning are the aiding of the enemy, the illicit promotion of the disclosure of data on the Internet, the transfer of information related to national defence and the abduction of State property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of a Mexican American.
According to the author, many Mexicans have been forced to leave Mexico because of their lack of capacity to realize themselves.
Mexicans are inclined to blame those who leave because they remind the inhabitants of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are divided between two cultures.
During my recent trip to Mexico City, I walked a corridor for arrivals, approached the border zone, and stopped on the ground.
The signs indicated two queues: one for Mexicans, the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I was called a Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italians.
I later found myself talking about the complex design of "American Mexican origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and became in line for ForeignJeros.
I remembered the story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nyeto, visited the White House and met President Obama.
Issues familiar to the meetings of the Presidents of those countries were immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto was eager to speak of the recovery of Mexico ' s economy, which would now, with the same success, enable Mexicans to remain in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and establish a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposal was made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and complete old issue.
Most Americans had never thought that the United States had invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory by gunfire.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not for minutes, and they see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only appropriate for a U.S. state party to beg at least a word of criticism in Mexico, in the press and among the elites of Mexican society to complain about the violation of the sovereignty of its neighbours by the Americans.
And the descendants of Montesuma are a warrior.
Mexico ' s relations with over 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States are the most difficult.
Do you want to talk about the offense?
That's enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who are finding opportunities in that country, and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Felix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin had only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone, a father or a grandfather, had not been able to live in Mexico and had to go north.
The most common were Mexicans of a certain type - striped, poorly educated, of poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we will remember it.
In Mexico, that's not what they see.
Today, our lives are the embodiment of American dreams, we went to good schools and got into good jobs, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know what country to consider.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most of the representatives of the Mexican elite and of the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them in the same way.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating injuries, and they treat us as the people of class two, as non-existent Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish well, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
We would not be behind a silk curtain now, finding life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and was legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain tensions between the real Mexicans and the Americans of Mexican origin, Mexicans are more clearly aware of their national identity, and Mexican Americans are offended.
She is a United States citizen and thinks she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my familiar Mexican Americans feel that they are not of any kind.
We're listening to the Los Tigres del Norte group of Mexico, but we love Bruce Springstin.
When you get the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during my visit, as if our relationship was not that simple, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals wanted to re-establish their relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as Ambassadors of Mexico and present her interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It won't work.
Too many offenses in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not see this country as so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unable to forgive the United States the way they dealt with Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still resentful of the way their relatives have been treated most recently in Mexico.
Yeah.
Perhaps we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas can become a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed leads to a conclusion that such hopes are futile.
It has been the custom, senseless debate over who first started; many buildings turned into ruins; over 140 Palestinians killed, most of them civilians; and six Israelis; for the first time in the Gaza Strip rockets fell in the vicinity of Israel ' s capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, while the Israelis and Palestinians have been hopelessly linked to their long-standing conflict, the Middle East has undergone changes.
This may be different, but the events of the Arab Spring have surrounded the rebellious storm with many persistent realities, and the Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay away from the whirlwind of the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons for hope that this deadly impasse will be overcome.
War without winners
At first glance, the situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, was to be implemented, this week ' s clashes only strengthened the security forces ' positions on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, claim that they had forced Israel to retreat despite its losses.
Despite the fact that some group leaders had been destroyed and 1.7 million had been blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled areas of our planet, Israel had failed to destroy Hamas.
Hamas is in fact increasing its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fath movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time works for them.
As Islamic movements expand in the Arab world, Hamas has developed new influential and wealthy friends.
Turkey ' s reborn regional leader, who was once Israel ' s closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
Hamas's voracious supporters claim the establishment around Israel of an Islamist semi-month, from Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah is ruling a paramilitary group, to Syria, where the pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad's power, and to Jordan, where Hamas's allies are threatening the King.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region has taken place on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohammed Mursi has been reinforced.
Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 30 years and had been destroyed in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay special attention to Hamas support.
On the contrary, the Muslim brothers are an organization that is much like Hamas, and their leaders are more populist.
In future diplomatic sites, Hamas can become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced, even by Israel and America.
At the same time, backers of the hard line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was pulverized.
The Israeli Iron dome missile system justified the cost of its establishment and successfully destroyed many of Hamas's launched missiles.
Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for a period of time.
As far as diplomacy was concerned, the United States remained consistent; many European countries also blamed the start of the last round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the Government of Binjim Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, some 30 Israelis had been killed by rockets fired from Gaza Strip, Israel had been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombings, in part through a wall entering the West Bank of the Jordan River, a significant portion of an unrecognized Palestinian State, and protecting the Jewish settlements, which continued to expand despite the illegality of such actions in international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the 22 January elections, joined with the even more aggressive conservatives led by Awigdor Lieberman, is quite comfortable.
What is the point of pretending to Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If they were given full authority in the West Bank, would they not start firing missiles from there towards Israel, as did their gathering in the Gaza Strip?
Better keep them behind the wall and severely suppress any attempt to raise their heads.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win; however, their calculations may be refuted in the Arab spring.
Even though the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be to become internal problems.
Israel's defence budget is more than all its Arab neighbours combined.
Linking war to a regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursi, who worked together with Barak Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of a change.
Israel must, to a lesser extent, take into account the long-term impact of its policies.
As democratic changes take place in the Arab countries, the denial of the right to self-determination by Palestinians is a slow-action bomb that will strike, sooner or later, in the occupied territories of Israel, like a bus blown up in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension, the growth of the Arab population, only exacerbates those problems.
The bloody operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas must pay the growing frustration of the international community.
Both sides need external impulses
The only solution that has been repeatedly called upon by common-minded representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world, and by our newspaper: the formation of two States and the assignment of territories by Israel in exchange for security.
There is still hope, not too impressive in the short term, that a ceasefire will enable other countries to make a more effective impact on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which is long overdue to decide to stop the transfer of arms to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has, more than ever, a beneficial position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State, adopted since 1967 in the light of the exchange of territories and the sharing of use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than the forthcoming United Nations vote, which could result in recognition of Palestine ' s virtual statehood.
President Obama also had a role to play in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to show his reluctance to join the issue.
It's a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Uniform Packing Act had entered into force for cigarettes.
Warnings of smoking damage and images of affected body parts are contrasted with those of remote green boxes similar to those of cigarettes for all.
In international practice, the Australian Act on Single-Smoking Cups and Tobacco Products came into force, replacing logos and the colouring of different marks with the same box of groovy-oiled images of sick portions of the body and images of children whose health is undermined by their parents' health.
In addition to the different pictures and inscriptions that warn of smoking harm, the only difference between packages that are necessarily introduced from this Saturday is the names of stamps that are printed in the same small font.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful fashionable status.
Such a decision was based on research that showed that people who did not start smoking before age 26 never become smokers in 99 out of 100.
“It is clear that even at the very young age, children understand the meaning of trying to deliver tobacco companies through packing,” explains Health Minister Tanya Plybersec, referring to studies that show, for example, that the crown in logo is associated with children with the idea of a princess.
Australia was one of the countries with the world ' s smallest share of smokers, so that those changes would not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries were considering such measures.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the enactment of the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes are sold.
“This law will lead to serious consequences other than those originally intended by its proponents”, according to Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacc in Australia.
The producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply far more such goods for sale in Australian streets.
On the contrary, new laws promote business growth.
Sandra Ha, of the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for portfolios and silhouettes concealing unpleasant images on the package has increased rapidly (practically from zero) since two months ago such companies as the British American Tobacc, the British Federal Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacc lost their case in the High Court of Australia, where they tried to appeal against the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold some six thousand items to wholesale businesses and is awaiting a new shipment.
It's a good business for us.
Experts believe that the popularity of social networks among the population targeted for such measures is a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that have made illegal television advertising and support for cigarettes, as well as preventing vendors from putting cigarettes in a visible position, tobacco advertising has moved on the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited local companies and websites from posting advertising on the Internet, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are a tobacco dealer and you only have this little loophole, the idea of moving your product on the Internet will make you very attractive," explains Becky Freeman, the next public health issue at Sydney University.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of trade names from allegedly ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the case of a ordinary citizen who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that he doesn't have the strength and time to make a video, or is it behind the commercial company?
The Australian office of British American Tobacc states that industry is more involved in adapting to new regulations than in advertising.
The representatives of the tobacco industry have even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: those States have filed claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, stating that the trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that the trade relations of all those countries with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plybersec, the Government has discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced first mandatory installation of smoking-proof photographs.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being addressed in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are dissociated from innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't pay attention.
"Just hogging a cigarette and hiding a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Hayg, who buys a picture of a cigarette with a mouth tumor on a pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yow, director of the King of the Pack store in central Sydney, claims that the same package made it more difficult to place the goods by sex
"I had an hour to unload my new batch, and now, four hours," he complained.
"The government should have taken a cigarette and completely banned it, then we'd have said, well, it's over, shut down the store," he says, throwing his hands up.
It's not that bad to download electronic networks and permanent connections in the world.
I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport on the day of thanks, because our plane had mechanical problems and had been replaced by another plane that we had been waiting for.
So I've had enough time to think about nature boring.
I will not deceive you.
The afternoon at the airport, awaiting a flight, is really boring, and neither books nor magazines, nor iPhones, nor even duty-free shops will help a lot.
Recently, however, a growing number of scientists and experts in child development have expressed themselves in favour ofannity.
They say that in certain situations it is not wrong for us and our children to miss.
This causes the brain to drift away on interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world all of us are constantly in front of a screen, the advantages of the boring pass through us.
Maybe we should try to miss it.
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, as many others had thought, that boring was an invention about the recent time when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tuy, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, who wrote the book The Loose History of Scot: A Live History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"Indeed boring can brag about a very ancient story," he said.
In Pompeii, Latin taste inscriptions dated to the first century were found.
However, the question of how we understand boring remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Yidod, associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of the boring has often changed.
After studying studies on this topic and asking a question to the target group of 100 persons, Professor Istood and his colleagues came up with the following definition: Scotch is when people “will but cannot do what would please them”.
The difference between boring and apatheticism, he said, is that a missing person doesn't do anything he would like to do.
I don't want to do anything in the appetite.
The main problem, he said, is “the deterioration of attention and the resulting deterioration of mood and feeling that time is slow”.
The scooter’s description may seem very much like a depression.
However, Professor Job claims that despite the possible link between these conditions, those who miss see the causes of the problems in the world and the circumstances, and those who suffer from depression see problems within themselves.
Sometimes it seems to us we're bored when it's really hard for us to concentrate on something.
In his study entitled “Unemployed Mind: The Definition of Attention Dept”, published in the September issue of Professionals on Psychological Science, Professor Esund and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment that heard the recording of the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds that were not relevant to the television program in the next room; others heard the same sounds in low volume, so that they could hardly be addressed, and the third group listened only to the recording of the vote without an outside track.
Those who heard the low volume television observed that they were bored, most often the others were hard to concentrate, but they did not know the reason for it, and attributed it to the boring.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fenzke, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we're doing something that's not interesting, "for example, by looking at the stream of products on the Conveyer in search of a marriage, distraction music can help to avoid boring".
He still thinks that when people start pumping on their chair or drawing a piece of paper, they do it from boring, but now we know that these actions are actually just helping not to relax physically.
"The study found that children who are not prohibited from eating and returning are better educated and given more information than children who are required to sit in peace," claims Professor Fenske.
At some point, all of us are bored: when we delay the flight (as in my case) by listening to a monotonous speech while watching an uninterested film.
However, different people show different degrees of taste for boredom.
In the 1980s, in order to measure these individual characteristics, researchers developed a special “bare” taste.
Questions and allegations are used to determine the assessment on such a scale, such as “Many of what I have to do, homogeneously and monotonously” or “I'm too interested, therefore, for nothing at all”.
Researchers have established, through such questionnaires, that boys miss more girls than they do,” says Stephen Vodanović, professor of psychology at the University of Western Florida, especially in the presence of a wide range of external opponents.
In general, however, adolescents are often missed.
In 1991, Rid Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted a experiment in which he linked with a pager to nearly 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents reported boring at school and at home, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside of school.
At the same time, only 3 per cent of parents indicated that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data on what the taste would be like now, 21 years later.
He knows, however, that “adolescent age has a high incidence of dexterity,” mostly because children and adolescents are not allowed to decide what to do.
Back to my original question, how boring is it?
Sometimes it is not, for extremes, according to research, can lead people to absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling, or the abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boring.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the link between boring and creative work, said Professor Vodanović, who had devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; it is boring," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But this brain itself doesn't always know what it's best to do.
If you're bored and you put that energy on the guitar game or the cuneiform experience, you'll do better.
But if you watch TV, you'll only be better for a while, and soon it'll go away.
So if your child misses and you give him iPad, he'll stop missing, but he won't learn to fight the boredom alone or in any other way to manage his time and employment,” Professor Fenske says.
“And these self-regulatory skills come into play in a variety of situations,” he argues.
Your kid learns not only to take care of himself, he also learns to control himself at all.
I don't think we've got to be boring.
But it's not worth considering bad either.
Rather, it is important to learn to feel comfortable even beyond the ever-increasing flow of action and technology.
Professor Izud agrees.
"We see it in such a way that we need to be bored more often, but boring is an extremely unpleasant, unintelligible desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get out of the way and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to the constant excessive stimulation of emotion organs," he says, "and when the silence comes, we lose and we don't know what to do."
Until it was clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado would be applied
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team player and student at a community college in the south-eastern state of Colorado, is charged with a criminal offence, namely, that soon it will be completely legal throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and a tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that one day in September, he and his friends were in Lamara, driving in a prairie car near the border with Kansas when they were stopped by police.
After the policeman had found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orosco had taken the agenda for possession of drugs and possession of drug equipment, minor offences, each of which was due to a $100 fine, and a date for the trial had been scheduled.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which has lasted several weeks after the State of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, hundreds of small cases are not dependent on the law but on the place of review.
The charges of minor marijuana-related offences have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charging people 21 years of age or older for possession of small doses, which will be considered lawful as soon as the law enters into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative regions of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to review existing marijuana cases and continue to be held accountable for possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from Denver suburbs to mountainous regions of the West, a vote has been taken to prevent new, licensed marijuana stores from emerging in their places.
"It's all going so fast that I don't even know what to expect," says Daniel J. Otes, chief of police in the city of Aurora east of Denver.
Representatives of supervisory bodies in Washington State are also puzzled by their heads.
They will have to establish regulations for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which will have to be done before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with marijuana issues, first for medical reasons, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, more orderly markets, so they will be a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Alcohol Production and Marketing Board in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, recognizes Mr. Smith than offer any proposals and hopes that this will work.
"We don't have a real precedent to guide us," he said.
The Washington State Bill, named I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will fill a year of uncertainty when there are no State licensing systems and the right of possession of marijuana is already legalized.
There are still some difficult technical aspects to deal with during this period, such as how to balance the state's “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana with a ban on selling it at 1,000 feet away from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed companies for the sale of marijuana in the urban frame, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs”, explains Ben Livingstone, representative of the newly established research group, “The Centre for the Legalization of marijuana”.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police from Aurora sent an e-mail report to his subordinates that the city's public prosecutor would no longer hold persons under 21 years of age accountable for possession of a small number of marijuana, and that the police would stop warning people of such violations “from now on”.
The Chief of Police, Outs, said that the police would monitor the city's compliance with the regulations governing medically-medical marijuana growers and prosecute illegal drug dealers and dealers.
The Welle District Prosecutor in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more stringent approach to this issue.
Following a vote on the draft law, he stated that the Public Prosecutor's Office would continue to hold accountable for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage its users to undergo treatment.
Currently, 119 persons have been charged with possession of two or less marijuana, although many have been accused of other violations.
“The duty of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission”, said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was mixed even in places such as the village district of Mesa, where voting participants rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The police force, Grand Junkshing, the largest city in the county, no longer holds adults accountable for owning a small number of drugs.
The district prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to withdraw charges in cases already under way involving the storage of marijuana.
"I believe it is our direct responsibility to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the population in Colorado who voted supported the decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal system would not be easy.
And the contradictory reactions of residents in different state places have revealed a mixed relationship between the local authorities and the marijuana experiment.
“The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this area” explains Sean McLister, a Dutch lawyer representing convicted persons of marijuana storage, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws.
"They've been pursuing people for this for so long that they can't really accept that it's not a crime anymore," he says.
Colorado and Washington, D.C., are the first states to have a small number of marijuanas, just as alcohol is intended to be a pilot country-wide field to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legitimates and state officials plan to expand the area of legalized trade, but they are also seeking instructions from the federal authorities, which continue to consider selling and growing marijuana as federal crimes.
The legalization of marijuana hopes that the Office of Justice will address this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of drug-using traffickers and patients, the federal government in most cases provided good results in the medical trade of marijuana in Colorado, Washington, D.C. and 16 other states.
The agents of the Anti-Narcotic Bureau are unlikely to enter the homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to a state-controlled recreation marijuana shop that is permitted under the new law, as Kevin A. Sabeth, a former drug control adviser in Obama's administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential elections, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on opening new marijuana stores that could not be opened earlier than a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western state, put forward a six-month ban on the sale of marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don't want to be in a position to license someone, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level”, says Bob Nicolson, a city councillor.
Our city voted against this amendment.
We now have a contradiction between the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petrnel Whitet: I was survived from Oxford for being a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their opinions has not begun today.
As long as I remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogy to an ancient symposium that sets out the two pillars of civilization - freedom and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks later, at the University of Oxford School of Art, at the end of the '80s, I collected suitcases and left, which led to the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I quit college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson was joking that I had to leave because I had to drink from cups.
It wasn't that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I escaped because I was systematically raped and intimidated.
It's not because of my rather unusual name or my private school experience.
I was treated for just one reason, and in this famous wheel of enlightenment, it looked like a voodoo and blind fanaticism: my father, the now dead Woodrow Whiteett, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thetcher, and I myself was a conservator.
You're gonna ask me, why remember this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students who hold legalistic views are subjected to the same kind of digestion.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as the one granted to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservators from the College College College of Cristi College in Cambridge claim that they are “often isolated, exposed to personal attacks and made themselves unwelcome” because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative into the College Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation had only worsened the recent BBC 2 documentary film on student policy, "Stress: Young, Smart and Right," in which conservatives were presented by eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford Conservatives Association, who rides the Rolls rose, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver cane.
In other universities, conservatory students complain that they're doing “the release bills because of the increase in school fees”.
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice President of the Nottingham Conservatives Association, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper, said that “the university environment increases the imbalance towards left views.
People who don't even know us think we're naked and with impunity the violent children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the University of Oxford College College of Christi College, where a protection request was filed, calls the atmosphere "unintelligible" and Stephanie Churchill, 19, a new president of the Oxford Conservatory Association, said that the attitude of the student club members towards the rights-based community had deteriorated considerably.
“It is a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal life of the members of the club”, she says.
I wasn't just in a minority in Oxford for the first few weeks, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, with a robot and a shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford was a gruesome thing about being a conservative party.
One year earlier, the former student Margaret Tetcher had been deprived of her honour by voting because of a reduction in the budget allocated to higher education.
In such an atmosphere, it would be strange for even the stalenists.
In the early days of the first - grade class, when students get to know each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time that I was waiting for me.
I had not yet known that the teachers not only looked through their fingers on the digestion of conservative students, but they were also happy to participate in it.
Political issues - miner strikes, privatization and Government opposition to the imposition of sanctions against the Government of apartheid in South Africa - have infiltrated the wooden panels of the wall.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared to follow it.
"Mrs. Whitet," said Professor Harry Pittt, now late, - please translate the first paragraph."
The text gave me a hard time, and I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very yellow man with a cake-like face.
"The students don't actually learn French or they just don't have the brains?" he asked.
The other students snitched.
My eyes were filled with tears.
"I advise you to take some early French lessons at free time, if you're not very busy going back into society," Pitt snuck.
I came back to my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I was sitting at lunch by myself, and then someone picked me up on my shoulder.
He was James, a second-year student from the English Department who appeared as a member of the University Conservatory Association.
'I know who you are,' he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, this is as follows:
Everyone suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives will be ridiculed.
It's not easy for me, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Tätcher, so it's going to be harder for you.
Most pre-conservatives pretend to be Leborists."
Later on, in the local pub, I was a coward.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Margaret Tetcher says.
You haven't failed.
The primary professor of philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied in Iton, said, "You're a fascist pig daughter.
You're contagious."
The other students caught up with his words.
I was ruined, dirty.
"How do conservatives do sex?" asked one of them.
- They're touching each other, aren't they?
I felt like I must have felt homosexual before the criminal prosecution was abolished in the sixtieth years.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or am I going to have to meet the like-minded only under the cover of night?
Would I be forced to become a lieutenant and hide my true beliefs?
For the next three years, hell, total persecution and loneliness had become a reality for me.
The only teacher at my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only because he belonged to conservatives, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser and one of her speakers.
He didn't show up at college.
He despised him for his vindictiveness, melocity and commitment to Marxist-determinist perspective in history.
In 1997, he was admitted to Professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said to me.
I went to Oxford from my parents' house in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and open - minded capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the fortieth years, all political views were taken.
"But that's the best university in the world," he said sadly.
- It doesn't work that way, except in the city...
Even my Communist friends have always acted impeccably."
His wet eyes are changed.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure these are just jokes.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was exhausted by my constant travels to London, and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a conservatory, did not stand the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
Next week, at a seminar, when another history teacher called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the shower of shame, I confessed that I had been brainwashed by parents and called them "old fools."
It wasn't long.
The last nail in the cover of my career at Oxford was to kill my father.
At that time he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Merdock.
My door was locked.
I did not leave, and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I collected the suitcase and the village for the first train to London.
I never came back.
You may call me a cloak and a twat.
But at the age of 18, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation at the educational institution.
To make matters worse, it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen Prime Ministers of the Tori, but is still hidden behind the undeserved reputation of a university in which equality and freedom are valued.
"Valentine prefers elegance of glory."
"Valentino: Master of Shiya" which opened in London this week, ABC is talking to Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz, and other well-known clients of an Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of England's Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital worthy of taking the Valentino Garvani exhibition.
The designer admitted this at the opening of Valentino: a workman, a three-year retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high-vows made by his “house” over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
The exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is the "il Sinor" Garvani, but it could not have been written without his personal clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of knowledge.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened until March 3th, there is a wealth of personal letters and photographs signed by the most prominent aristocrats, from Princess Salem Aha-Hang to Lord Snoudon, including Marie-Santal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise, from the modest port city of Voger in northern Italy to the cumir of the international Elita.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong.
"They don't at least put out their cigarettes about your beautiful carpet, like some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baroness Fion Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impenetrable host and receives guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to come to his tent in Gstada," explains a former wife of Heni Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Anieli or Eugionia Niharhos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to glory.
And despite that, he's a star.
Valentino Valtino
The Argentine model Valérie Mata remembers a charismatic modeler.
One day we went to see him dinner home, which was after showing fashion on the Spanish square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, the youngest.
Willy Valentino stood out in every detail of his apartment, in her dress, in her food, in his music.
"Every guest of Valentino felt important and loved," recalls the "top-model", which began with the model in 1995 during the Paris High Model Week.
"He's never out of fashion, because his sketches are actual works of art," she ends.
Council of Relatives
Harvani's life is a story, not of obsession, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with fine discipline and high titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House galleys was turned into a glamorous pod 60 meters long: the visitor takes the place of the model and is required to defil the podium, the gravy gravy of the gravy that connects the masterpieces of Valentine, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the suit she used by Monica Whitti at Night, or the coat of wool and skin that was owned by the emperor Fara Diab.
In this model audience, names such as Sibila Luxembourg, Gloria von Thornund Taxis, Matte-Marit of Norway, Rosao of Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg are shining.
Nati Abascal and designer, 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentine's first is like the first love, "can never be forgotten."
I remember him beautiful.
They were pants, shirts, vests, and jackets from a collection of autumn-zim 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he made to me," says Nati Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I commend him for his femininity, for his great love of women, because he stresses our beauty," adds the former duke de Feria.
I really like the color that he uses, they have a lot of light and they're going to go to his face.
Proportion is perfect.
The princess and the lawyer of the fashions of Patricia della Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she's dressed in Valentine's.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamt that I would have to be old and have reason to wear one of his night's toilets...
Finally came the time in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress to put it on at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a lukewarm jacket, a "carriage" in a fold and a cut without a tape.
"It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, and his passion is too late," explains this Italian aristocratic woman who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps his holiday dress from a designer with "maximum Care... because dress is not just a dress, it's also a collection of memories accompanying it."
The Modem King
The Grand Final Exhibition at Somerset House is a wedding dress by Marie-Santal Miller for her wedding with Pavels from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as a modeler of her necks) to make this ink from a silk of ivory with incipation of the pearl, twelve species of various circles, and one and a half meters.
According to the journalist Suzi Menquez, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a milestone in the high fashion of the end of the twentieth century, the return of higher-light customers.
Deceptive for many years of the elite's "life", now Valentino himself is her best representative.
The Grand Cross Cavalry (the distinguishing mark of the highest rank in Italy), the Cavaler of Labour, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Words, awarded by the Order of Honorary Legion, has gathered as many honors as any of the spouses of its clients.
"All the while, my attention was drawn to his perplexity, his calmness, his delicate and impeccable appearance," recalls Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a solemn dinner in the Museum of Orsay.
He was sitting at my great friend's table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe.
"He was useless, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The world's most difficult occupation: miners from Kawah-Ijen
In four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health, carrying 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of a volcano on steep stone tropics
There are people whose jobs are hell, and some are literally working in hell.
Among them are Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living on the mining of sulphur in the Kawah-Ijen volcano, which is located in eastern Indonesia's Java Island.
Each day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas rising from the depths of the earth stops in contact with the air.
Through huge fragments of sulphur, which can weigh as much as 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, pulls the baskets on his shoulders, and carries them upstairs on a rocky road.
The 2,386 - foot [2,386 m] volcano’s peak is only 250 m high, but wet loaders need more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle with the difficulty of keeping the balance and keeping the road from falling off.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, like that of a French tourist who crashed a few years ago from the Kawah-Ijen cliff.
Cavah-Igen chess earn 5 euros per kilo of sulphur that is produced
Upon reaching the top, they lay their way between tourists who photographed them, as if they were apes from a circus and tired of heavy baskets, walking three miles [3 km] to the weights the mining company has placed a little higher at an altitude of 1,850 feet [1,850 m].
This is the case of Candy Ngrambia, a company that has operated since 1960, and it is better not to say that its employees pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kg of sulphur.
It then sells it for Rs 10,000 (83 euros) in petroleum production, since it is a mineral that is used in daily life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynasties and even for the paint of sugar.
"As a rule is the transfer of 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (Euro3.8) per walk," Anto explains to us, which usually takes three daily transports.
It spends three hours each and feels broken at the end, but it allows it to store 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a mineral for such an unnatural effort, it is three times what it would have earned in the field.
" The daily wage paid to miners is very high in local measures, where 15,000 rupees are paid per day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros) " , which is explained by a cargoer who used to work as a stoner on the Baltic tourist island.
There his salary was Rs. 75,000 a day and the site was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banhuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as destructive as Sera: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus have brought her to Yawa to accept Islam."
Anto is asthma, he breathes hard, he coughs all the time, and his eyes are tearing because of toxic gases.
At its 27 years of age, Anto had spent three years at risk in Kawah-Ijen, whose grays had already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and eyeglasses.
He has asthma, he breathes hard, he coughs all the time, and his eyes cry because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
It's the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'll work for another two years because I want to open up a store or study Spanish or French," he promises to do more than acceptable English.
Suffocated by life, this nice and smart young man could be a tourist guide, a waitress, or a port in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mud.
For the dirty wooden cabin with the other porters, it stands at two o'clock every day, because the gray doesn't stop running through the night, when its distinctive yellow color turns blue and pales in the darkness.
In a thread, Anto goes down to the crater, exposing himself to a small lightlight connected to his helmet, which he bought on his own money.
About 400 porters carry a basket of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized the production of sulphur for cost savings or provided any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of Rs. 30,000 (Euro2.5) of the photo collection, which, along with an entrance ticket for Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2), is being taken from tourists by its guards to take pictures of the volcano and its muloved people.
"This is a livestock job, not a human job," says Badrishin, the root bearer for 42 years, who has spent three decades in Kawah-Yegen since the college left.
He's able to raise up to 110 kilograms, and he's sure he's going to endure a job as much as he can, because he needs money for the education of his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns the throat and lives as the wind suddenly changes and traps miners in dense pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so heavy that no one is so bitter that they are more likely to be ill... to be more serious than their usual breathing problems, the arthrouses, the pain in the knees and the ovaries on the shoulders, which have been deformed under the weight of the basket.
By balancing the basket on the back, the Master can now only raise 50 kilograms at his 53 years of age.
Every day, he and his comrades remove 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to a storage site in Tamansari, which travels 18 kilometres across a narrow trope across the hills.
"I don't retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Uninik, opening his mouth wide, which lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
The time is passing, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what human flies do from Kaveh-Jegen.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeis blaming their careers, stress, and housing and education prices in the absence of children.
“The Singapore population needs to grow”.
I'm Patriot's husband, you're my sister-in-law, and we'll pay our civil debt and make life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the ads of minted blades, but, despite that, or as a result, this video became a YouTube hit in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Give me the bao (bow) in the liver" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a entertaining way by means of advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to live up to their national debt.
This thing is just for the Internet, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
That's the main problem in the country.
We are the worst subjects in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this was the subject that we should address.
We knew that the Government had been trying to do a lot, such as having a spirit set up with pherones or having rapid dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative but have not worked.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can do to solve this problem, to make a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take this lightly are the Singaporean Government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for a child, renews maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech town in South-East Asia, also known for its leadership and its strict public control.
The fertility rate in Singapore, according to its national population administration, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was less than 2 -- known as the percentage of substitution -- in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Marriage and Family Policy Office of the National Population Authority, says that the reason for “acquired education” and “more extensive career gamma”.
“This has allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life's goals and priorities than marriage and family creation”, she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of bachelorts and the delay in marriage and childbirth, which has led to a decline in Singapore ' s fertility rate.
However, immigration policies, which aim to dramatically increase immigration in order to counter the decline in the population, have created resentment among the local population.
Singapore has websites that thrives in barely hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages at a low level and reluctant to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that last year Singapore ' s ruling party obtained the worst results in elections since independence.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem by quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unforeseen consequences
While the decline in fertility has had a notable impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, spending on medicine and immigration policies, Singapore ' s example also began to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government was making efforts to avoid the construction of so many small houses.
This, for example, is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has moved to control the number of small apartments known as the Occupy Box, which can be built in certain areas of the city.
The 46 square metres of these apartments are very well sold.
However, it is felt that they can contribute to the idling of life and prevent the developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lima Yu Sun, director-in-Chief of the El Developers Building Company, says that their “brought boxes” are sold much faster than more extensive copies.
They're more popular in the sense that these apartments are being purchased for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash revenues are increasing.
Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidance to the planners, who were once challenged if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too tense.
Singapore is the city state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have a special effect.
“People are very tense, housing is expensive, as is education, and that's why many people put it on hold,” says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and housing and education prices as reasons to prevent them from having children.
Thus, no matter how hard the Government tries to encourage its citizens to bear children, as far as childbirth is concerned, the last word remains for Singaporeans.
On-line personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, this is a private or “private life which is entitled to be protected from any interference”.
What does it mean for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his day-to-day life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers of discussing Internet situations that he would certainly not share on the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five people between the ages of ten and 15, who are frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very much mine," in a personal perspective, and with "the password and the name of the user," when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets would not be caught in the post," says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain his personal significance on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Mediaer, where he's had accounts for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
On FB, I'm getting beautiful pictures or games.
I'm also having fun with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that isn't mine or someone who's acting stupid," he said.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to publish indecent pictures of naked people, crimes, or write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge says she knows the 35 friends he has at FB and nine of his Follawers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
My mother knows she has a password for one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if it's up to me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertainment, "I can talk to extended relatives or my friends as quickly as possible," he says.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't treat anyone who recommended it to a stranger.
The 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music like that," he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him or asked for a home address or phone number.
"If they pressure me or demand me, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the Twitter recommendation.
The boy's no longer the experience of what's known today as cyberbbeying.
One of my friend’s acquaintances was blackmailing on a social network.
He was threatened and forced to pay.
"He never found out who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not delete the record.
“The inclusion of confidentiality only”.
He then explains the sequence of steps to build the account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have loaded photos of strangers in uncomfortable or Confucian situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like a person or if I wanted to.
"How do I know it's cyberbabing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marílos Porras, an English teacher and an education and learning specialist, believes that if children and adolescents are to be directed, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networking is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information, but the rules of the game have changed with these sites," she says.
Porsa points out that an academic named Mark Prínski, a professor of education at Yale University and author of employment, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginal are they, children and young people, born in the age of technology.
"We're the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we're still studying ourselves," she says.
It explains that the topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or said, at a time when maturity is not enough to do so”.
"So that they are selective, and it's important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show the confidentiality of children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them reflect.
"To tell them not to do it, it is useless," she adds.
Then Porsa lists some options: some things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like to have a picture of you, like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others publish about you?
When you sign pictures from a party, do you ask other people for permission to mark them?
And one more thing, do everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to act on-line just as they do on-line.
The rules are the same.
"There is no Internet man who behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, but should be on social networks," she claims.
Watchfulness
Estuardo Garardiya, university teacher, professor of primary education and education consultant, explains the need for heads of families to read in good faith social networking policies.
Knowing each of the points, they have good reasons to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an Internet account.
"For one thing, age and what is allowed to circulate or publish," he said.
According to Gaurdiya, the key question is to remind children of the lesson, "Don't talk to strangers."
The UNASD summit will end without the Lima Declaration
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the disclosure of the Lima Declaration, which was previously and theoretically signed by the binding parties.
Efe has repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the VIth ordinary meeting of the heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Administration of the President indicated on the main page that he would be transferred after the closure, but then confirmed that it would be published at the moment on the Peruvian Government ' s website.
On questions about the text, they indicated that the contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Oljanta Umala, during brief press statements.
The access of journalists to information about the Summit has been limited at all times.
During the day, it was broadcast, in the press room, without sound from the Presidential Assembly, with a message of “closed session, no sound”.
A few of the information that has been circulated among the reporters was shared by the press reporters of some of the Governments of UNASDUR that attended the meeting, but not by Peruvians.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating Presidents, which was a source of resentment to hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian President's administration sent an e-mail to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was a Umassa statement, not a formal document that concluded the summit.
In the past October, Peru had hosted the III Summit of the South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and that time, despite the persistent demands of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been proclaimed, had not been circulated.
On the official APA website, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had made sure that all journalists were provided with transmission systems, but had been severely limited to information.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olyanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinier, met at a regional meeting and ratified, which would comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which commenced on Monday, at The Hague, the hearing of both parties, in the context of the prosecution against Santiago by Lima.
“We will observe and execute a decision that will explain the differences we are now presented with this international court”, said Umala, next to his Chilean colleague.
“Chile has been, is, is and will be a country that respects international law, a peaceful settlement of differences, covenants and international tribunals”, added Pinheer, and welcomes the hands of Uma against the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they were subject to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia challenged this week the Bogota Pact, according to which it acknowledged that it was subordinate to the verdicts of that international court after the decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which it considered to be wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christiana Kirschner.
Paraguay, whose membership in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had been suspended since 2011, following the impeachment of his former President Fernando Lugo, had not participated in the meeting.
The incoming President, Olyanta Umala, was responsible for opening the debate this morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The Head of State read the outcome document in which it was reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 project directions for the South American countries had been approved, with an investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements that had been adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASDUR would take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residence agreement”.
He said that steps were being taken to improve “cooperation against citizens' lack of confidence and organized transnational crime, to increase access to medicines, to affordable Internet access in all parts of South America, and to take into account the cumulative and effective risks of natural disasters”.
Since Europe in crisis should not have a triumphal base but should serve to expand our productive base and see a better future for our cities, but added Umala.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 sign projects that will improve the connection between the spaces of South America, especially in the village and border areas... by uniting our countries and creating new economic schemes," said the Peruvian President in the message he had read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five belonged to Peru and were limited to cross-border axles on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two aimed at having a greater link with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The outcome document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will re-access it to the Union of South American Nations” from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united, and to have good relations between its neighbours, was another theme emphasized at the summit.
In this respect, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before he began attending a regional meeting, which he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortego, on Saturday in Mexico City, to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute resulting from the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogota.
"After the day after Saturday, maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We'll have to review all these ways, they don't mutually exclude, including the Nicaraguan Pact, from discussing with Nicaragua," he stressed.
“With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible”, added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico City on Saturday, where they will have a new president, Enrique Penya Nieto, to take office.
Also at the summit, the Ministers of Defence held a preliminary meeting to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Colombia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay constitute UNASUR, although the latter ' s participation is suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America should learn from Europe on the question of the integration of citizenship” by Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, affirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is the goal of “South America, in this case, should learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, declared to the Peruvian State television that Europeans were “killing each other during the Second World War” and other clashes, “but now they are almost alone”.
He defended, in this context, the project to establish South American citizenship, which endorsed the countries parties to UNASUR.
“The need to free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reaction sectors that want us back into the past”, he warned.
Ecuador ' s President has also shown support for the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the assumption of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Human Rights Covenant.
Those who give lectures never commit anything, and we, the South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is true that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and financed by the United States”, he stated, hinting at the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanjo.
Correa assured him that he was not sorry for the decision because he had not given his principles to him, but he respected his “best values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that at the time “there were certain suspicions that Asang would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be respected”.
He criticized, moreover, Swedish justice for requiring that he be present in his territory to question the alleged sexual offence, whereas “it is possible under Swedish law to implement it through a videoconference that could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of deterioration in Assang's physical and mental health.
"I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our Embassy, but the Ambassador has informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
What is true is the danger of deteriorating his physical and mental health due to the inflammation of a small space without the possibility of exercising in the air.
"It affects the health of every person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum granted to Assangjo since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by providing a guarantee of integrity that would allow him to go to Ecuador was in the hands of the British, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of sinking the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, but we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the British, Sweden and the European judiciary, because counsel Assangja, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European bodies”, he mentioned.
And I thought, "If Britain gives tomorrow the guarantee of integrity, it'll end."
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation allows it and as it has done elsewhere, is to question Mr. Assang at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or to question him in Skype, tomorrow it will be exhausted.
Correas took the opportunity to show himself to be a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate “the directness, integrity and lies which distorted freedom of expression”.
"The head enemies of freedom of the press are not spoiled political villains, but bad journalists supporting profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he remained happy that neither these journalists, “neither bankers nor burgers of hegemon countries dominate Ecuador”, and added that, as re-elected, “a revolution to continue development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in the UNASUR until at least the next elections, arguing that the organization “must be firm and should not tolerate opportunism and support for the coup d'état of Ma'unity” because, in reality, “this has destroyed the lawfulness of Paraguay's democracy”.
The Ecuadorian President also considered that the desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime boundaries between the two countries, following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which had been in favour of Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty, was “reasonable”.
This decision has not been respected at the moment.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to process them together in order to overcome them and move forward.
He also looked forward to a good conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute in the same Court of Peru and Chile and said that it was “right for Latin America to apply to international bodies if two countries were obliged to make a decision whatever it was”.
With regard to the opportunity to be a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he was considering this opportunity “with greater optimism and joy, although sometimes it is difficult”.
Correa assured me that if she lost in the February 2013 elections, she would leave society.
On a personal basis, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be redressed by political power.
"My political movement considered that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so that I must recognize that responsibility," he said.
If we won, that would be my final term as President, and then we will leave public life.
If we lose, we lose the same thing.
"It's a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he was on his way to a treatment that had already been planned, routine and that he was expected to miss out on a campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean the deterioration of President Chávez's health," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State took part today in Lima at the VI Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (USASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS today is a result of late diagnosis
Fabricio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS analysis had a positive effect.
"I was so deaf," he recalls, "in spite of all the tact of the doctor, the moment.
Young man hid it from his family.
He wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified -- he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabricio is one of the “old” HIV patients at Hospital Civil de Guadajara (HCG), where he got in 1994, and has overcome many obstacles.
In the early 1990s, it would have been difficult to believe that there were too few treatments, too little knowledge of the disease, too prejudiced.
So, even the director of the clinic at the Mexican Social Protection Institute didn't want to say good-bye to him because he was cut.
In other words, having AIDS at that time was a sentence.
Now it is possible to survive the syndrome and do so without impairing the quality of life.
Nevertheless, without knowing how sick they are, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, have “destroyed” their immune system and are suffering from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “a major achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, said the head of the HIV/AIDS unit HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andra Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but that the length and quality of life depend on the extent of the immune system available to patients at the beginning of diagnosis, with better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with a figure of 200 CD4 and up to 50 years, where 500 CD4 are reported.
To put it simply means that someone who receives a diagnosis of HIV at the age of 25, according to these terms, “by maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6.6778 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that, since the emergence of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
In Khalisco, 255 people died in 2011 alone, and 187 by May of this year have already been recorded; nevertheless, there has been a widespread availability of antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why still have summer results?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it, and it's the way it's done in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we haven't had enough medication, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He gave up devastating data: “Twenty out of ten patients come when they already have any opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to conduct diagnostics early in life, and therefore it is necessary to provide large-scale detection samples for all people who ask it.”
The proposal brings together specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Khalisco (COESIDA), as well as patients like Fabricio, who turned to a private laboratory for screening, motivated only by his friend and, despite his youth, he was already at the AIDS stage and even suffered from the masquerade of Kaposshi, a cancer tumor, which is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything.
They say, but not in my case.
There's a positive change, I'm well fed, I'm making exercises, I'm taking drugs.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like any other life.
"I work a lot, I travel, I live an active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and another person," said Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JACISCO, to advance his statement by those who, in the context of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them check, if there's a risk of infection, see if they're HIV-positive as soon as possible, and if they've got a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person who's responsible.
This presentation summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year.
Preservatives by Conservative
Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajhar who has dealt with HIV-related issues, believes that there is a wide gap between health programmes and a simple citizen.
And the biggest prevention is that.
In the sites devoted to this task, "really, the distribution of condoms has increased, before we've been given one or two, now we're getting hundreds of packages, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are some who don't have access to the condom right now," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do they ask you?" It's a popular question, an ejadic and convicted question, from social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health workers who don't want to hear teenagers, assured the propagandist.
I propose that this inefficient distribution be changed; that condoms be not just waiting for the counter, and that hundreds of them be in machines in public toilets in places often visited by young people.
It's not the promotion of immorality.
It is not about paying for beer and motels, but the Governor, Emilio González, responded when asked if condoms could be distributed under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, best to make condoms accessible to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Khalisco
A total of 13.435 cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV) have been recorded.
The State is ranked 4 in the national rating for new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13 in HIV.
92% are sexually transmitted, 6% through blood and 2% through perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of the Vitro Panel's rescheduling of debt through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario set a rock precedent for any national company with affiliates in a neighbouring country that has difficulty in paying.
It seems that the procedures for supporting the survival of firms, which are governed by Mexican laws, are not valid in the country of lanes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the judgement rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale in a court of bankruptcy in the northern district of Texas leaves defenceless Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the side of Rio Grande.
However, the order opens the doors of the lead glass manufacturer in Mexico to apply to the United States Supreme Court, putting three inconsistencies into evidence.
As an admission, while the judge notes that creditors are to be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Appeal Court, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceeding relates to the competitive proceedings considered in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law has been established to that end, defining as an arbitrator the American Institute of Law.
Second, the verdict states that without the inter-firm vote recognized in the critical mass of the debt-producing competition which the parent of the branch of Vitro would not have achieved the majority necessary to approve restructuring.
Nevertheless, that possibility was recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time the scheme was adopted.
There are half the examples, of which Agemex and the General Mexico, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition Production.
It is also true that, by reading out the voices of affiliates, in one way or another the creditors of Vitro who fought against him in United States courts, namely “survivors”, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elito Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent, as against 37 per cent.
These figures are dropped by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation he has faced since 2008, which has been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States is facing in the face of attacks on the country.
So far, a firm of the González Garden family will appeal to the Court of Appeal itself to vote before the plenary, i.e. five judges, for only three votes.
In the event of a failure, an application for a certificate will be made, which will require a review of the trial by the highest court, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the Court rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico as amicus curiae (“second court”), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Products Act, warning that it exempts itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries in order to link it to article 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Two-board Karambol, they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Overall balance
In view of the several months-long complaints that have been placed on the table by Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askar Andrade, who is accused of fraud in the Department of Fraud, a pilot association of aircraft has already found a bottled throat.
The establishment, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino, has just filed a criminal case against the National Banks and Security Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory body systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic on the operation carried out by the business to extract from the trust fund F/589 of the IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexica Airlines.
Resources would be used for the purchase of shares by a professional hotel management company.
As you know, Askar Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Dragon Mart is surrounded by Dragon Mart
Meeting on the weekend at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of general civil society endorsed the establishment of a broad front against the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are speaking, as you know, of the giant centre for sale and distribution to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from an isolated country, with a housing zone close to 150 companies.
Canacintra had previously been able to bring together the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces, which compared the land to the protected territories and pose serious threats to the industry.
The Death of ACTA
With regard to the Government's request to the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Counter-Terrorism, known as the abbreviation for the English ACTA, according to the Institute of Industrial Property of Mexico, the case has now moved to the archives.
As you know, the action has been carried out even though the Senate itself has disqualified the possibility of viewing it as a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debt, without affecting the short-term housing developer homex puts the Bail's certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of the four identical, with interest being offered every 28 days.
Competival Comes to the Light
Enlightened by the NYCE, e-Quáliacity and Kernet enterprises, the information technology leaders, the Competeival consortium just came into being, the aim of which will be to market the services of the software clusters in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector of Hetin Reyes, Basketball was my life.
The healthy basketball traveller Hector Hetin Reyes had been involved in this sport for over 60 years, and it has brought him around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember so much basketball stories as Hector Hetin Reyes.
And before his brain he was forced into a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was loaded in sports for more than 60 years, as a small-category player, a player of the Higher basketball League, a Commissioner and Head of BSN with Kowby Baemon and the President of the Basketball Federation.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several times when I was President BSN, Director-General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during his visit to his home to Baimon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
Basketball was my life.
Reyes is not exaggerating by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost every photographed and memorable thing he built for his long journey, testify to this.
Baymon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he retains those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old as a partner or contract agent.
“This was my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I had the opportunity to be part of eight cowboy champions since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or leader.
It was many years of joy, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsk debut in BSN.
From that moment on, Ortiz, who was a great administrator, continues to lead the Cuko,
I remember Gene Bart, who was on his way to Alabama University, Birmingham, who said, "I have a very strong player for you, growing 6'7."
"Would you?"
And that was the beginning of Minsk, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartt then recommended a sniper, Raymond Gaussa, who received citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsk had brought the Bayion championship, Gauss would have helped to win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy championship with House, but at a distance, because by 1988 I was the head of the Federation.
By that time, I had preferred to enjoy Minsk's achievements and achievements in the national assembly.
I remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic training tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we won the fourth place and it was to be bronze if not for the Canadian judge who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
And the 1990 World Championship team is the best set you've ever seen?
She's among the best, as she won with Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that since the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and destroyed the United States, which was pretty much like the one that won our bronze on the championship of the world.
Not only did they play Minsa, Gaussa, Ramona Rivas, Fico López and Piccina (Orcina), but also young (Havier) "Tonito" Colon and James Carter, brothers León (France and Edgar) and Mario 'Khoote' Morales, who could not participate in the 1990s due to knee trauma.
The team, which may not have been the best team in terms of personnel, but has brought us a gold medal and great pleasure, was the team of the 1995 Olympic qualification tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With the role players like "Canito" Nyvesa, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Herruitner in exchange for those who have been suspended for disorder at the Pan American Mar del Plata championship, we have won gold in spite of all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
His figures on the international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico dominated this level in the way Pikulin did.
And that's without taking into account his career in the different leagues he's playing.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young man, Julio Toro, Flora Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmao, Armandito Torres.
Young, I love Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national assembly between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you want to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, Ponce boys should play only in their own field and only against teams from other parts of the island in national offs.
Now, guys travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I'm listening to music, watching music from my age on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and spending some of my time on basketball.
And of course, I enjoy my wife's society, Isabel, which has always been with me.
He died an actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, at Fort Wert, Texas, became world famous for his main role as John Ross Yuing, better known as J.R., in the "Dallas" television series, where he incorporated a businessman without principles, evil or manipulation.
Larry Hagman, whose role as warlord's oil magnate, J. A. E., in the "Dallas" television series, became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. at the new Dallasa season, died on Friday night because of the complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement made to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a study of Dollas.
"Lari has returned to his favorite hometown of Dallas, again playing a key role that he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him at the "Dallas" fair in honor of Thanks Day.
Linda Grey, who played his wife's role in the original show and in the sikwell, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, said her representative, Geoffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind and talented, and I'll miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," confirmed Grey in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and transferred to a transplant.
Long before Dollasa, Hagman gained fame on television thanks to the role of a decent type in the light comedy of "I Dream of Jeannie" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive genna girl who is playing Barbara Eden, and starts living with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedys who rarely appeared on the air, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included the role well-established by critics in The Group, Harry and Toronto, and Primaria Colours.
But it was his master's interpretation of the awesome J.R. led Hegman to the top of the glory.
The dramatic CBS series on the Jung clan and other characters in its environment was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The J.R. advertiser, designed to make noise around the episode, full of emotions where Hagman's character almost kills, has generated international discussions and millions of dollars that have been risked by bookmakers.
It also helped attract a record audience to the show at that time.
When the answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million television viewers watched it and turned Dallas into a second stage of entertainment in history, after the closing of the MASH in 1983, attracted 50 million spectators.
It was J.R., Christine, who shot him.
J.R. stopped and then threatened her to be prostitutiond if she didn't get out of town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Junguing as an insatiable corrupter with charismatic smiles: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Grey), to be treated.
"I know what should be on J.R." said Hagman in 1988.
It must be said, "It is here for an honest citizen, J.R. Jung."
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Príncipal, also the heroin of the original TV series, was reminded on Friday of Hagman as someone who's "silver, both on and off."
It is forgotten and indispensable to millions of readers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who are fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new "Dallas" were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
The recording of five episodes of the second season and the sixth were in production, reported the canal.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements about what would happen to a series after Hegman left.
A student of Fort Weert, Texas, was the son of an actress and a singer, Mary Martin, who glistened in classical works like "Suth Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he gave birth to him in 1931 during his marriage with counsel, Ben Hagman.
He sought happiness in the theaters of New York in the early 1950s and then served at the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, May Akselsson, and married her.
They had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many famous people live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Holo Darlin': Tal (and Absolutillery True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't include anything in that that I felt capable of causing pain to anyone or affecting them in any way," he said to Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a hospital volunteer to help patients who were afraid.
“I give them advice, give them courage, date them when they go to operations, and after”, he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, kind of, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little awkward for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course is being developed that studies the End of the World.
Every week, students are studying apocryphal phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this spleen, when Professor of Religion Stuart Sharme decided to read the course on the end of the world, he knew he had the inexcusable lure: the end of the “long reverse count” of the Maya calendar, 21 December, for which many people took hold as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharme had no idea what he was expected in the next couple of months: the catastrophic storm Sandi, the financial crisis that some call the “long-magidaddon” and the growing conflict to which Israel would enter into, a place where Christian theories of the end believed that the Apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic of all," Sharme said this week to the students of Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey.
If we look at what's happening in the world today, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember, bad things are bad for those who have an acoptic thinking image.
And he's not the only professor to offer courses on the subject of the end of the world in this sester -- theoretically the last thing in history.
At the University of Templ, an associate professor, Barry Waker, receives a course on “the media, culture and the end of the world”.
Every week, students explore apocryphal themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're looking at why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, and the way in which the hypothetical scenarios of certain human acts are suggested.
If nuclear material were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break in.
During this month, students analyzed films on apathetic topics and examined how they relate to real-life examples.
'I've tried to tell the students that it's probably true and impossible,' said Wucker.
Matthew Restal and his colleague Amar Solari, Associate Professor of Art and Anthropology, joined the main company of the University of Pennsylvania, to read a course that is simply called the End of the World.
"We're not adding '2012' so we can always read the course again if the end of the world doesn't come," said Restal.
Despite the “immune destruction”, students must learn, prepare projects and pass final examinations.
In the Penn State, the final examination will be taken to the Canon of the Apocalypse, which leaves no choice for students except to work "before the night in which the end of the world is expected to take place," said Restal.
The courses were quite popular.
"The city ended in two hours," said the Restaurant about his course for high middle-level students to whom 35 students were enrolled.
We've received e-mails within weeks before the start of the seeds from people who asked if there were any other places.
The students, in turn, assure themselves that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Brijid Robinson, a 23-year-old student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And an apathetic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Vequesa, a 25-year-old student from psychology and nursing, said that he was watching all the apocryphal films.
"I never heard of a course that would teach it," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed -- let alone the professor -- said he believed that he believed the date of the end of light on 21 December.
"Our first project was about Maya prophecy, and in some way we discredited him," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the last course at the University of Temples at West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said Restal.
But he pointed out that there was an apathetic concern in Western culture, which had several centuries in which people were responding to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has generated an increase in speculation.
"There are other places where people don't think of it," he said.
Plenty in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered whether he knew of any course on the “end of the world” there.
"Philippines does not take part at the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at a higher authority.
We have the Pope's pardon.
He drew attention to the many days of the last court and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people would immediately begin to think of the next date” or to assume that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period in which the world would end.
Students and teachers take care of this date.
Some said they were going to go to a party called the end of the world.
"Maybe I'll call one of my friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student in the Faculty of Communication.
