Parliament does not support the amendment that gives freedom to Timoshenko.
Today, in the course of the amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Parliament of Ukraine has rejected an attempt to repeal an article condemning an opposition leader, Yulia Timoshenko.
An amendment which would have led to the release of the former Prime Minister in prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the mitigation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas transaction with Russia, which was found to be unsatisfactory.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will consider Timoshenko ' s appeal in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is a political revenge; in the West, the trial is also suspected of prejudice.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
A total of 226 votes would be required for its ratification.
The victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or insurgency, Libya has already lost.
Muammar al-Qadhafi is buried somewhere in the desert without him.
The time has come to identify the winners.
As a rule, Islamists are defeated in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of Shariat's customary law, which we have already heard of.
Libya will be a country without crime, as the penalty for theft is a cut off hand.
Women may forget to emancipate; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a rival clan society will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we can't imagine and that is unlikely to be desired.
Whatever the case, our way of life is neither the only one, nor the best, nor the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic militants accepted help from the unbelievers.
Their only excuse is that, in their opinion, NATO took the lead, not by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after every blow.
And if you look for the winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in gunfire, served Islam, and our policies were rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of benefit.
In view of recent painful experiences with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce the military occupation of Libya.
There is no need for the local population to be concerned about the expulsion of the “Cretans”.
Although oil companies would have little or no credit for the black gold of Libya, would they not?
And the West will finally be able to enjoy the unselfish protection of civil rights.
Unless Shariata's followers put it to rest.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are now a focus of investor attention.
The statistics storm hit Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have reported GDP data in three quarters.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stalemate, Germany and France showing growth.
Still, the debt market is running record today.
Investors are already looking beyond Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP has been increased by an expected 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany handled better than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of a original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (original information was projected to be stagnated).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared with the previous quarter, GDP was stagnant, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than predicted by analysts.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a stagnant state compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany’s economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
Between July and September, both the eurozone and the European Union had shown an increase of 0.2 per cent compared with the previous quarter, which coincided with the forecasts of analysts.
Greece ' s economy showed a preliminary drop of 5.2 per cent.
Its ten-year bond income is 28.45 per cent.
The income of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching the critical mark.
Even Austria, France, the Netherlands and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the deteriorating situation in the region, the return of Czech 1-year bond remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech Congregation was selected at EURO.
In Montenegro, they won at 1:0 and celebrate an unexpected money prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully met the most challenging challenge of the season!
Through the magnificent Czech and beautiful nuns of Peter, Jirekek, they won with an account of 1:0.
The Czech team, in its second half, was fortunate to retain a significant advantage after the home-responsive match, and will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz observed the match and produced a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and great luck in the second half.
The Czech national team was assembled, partly because of the defeat of the command at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Yiraček; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated the entrance to the European Championship.
The excellent defence of the Czech team allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments in the second half of the game.
Damianović and Puečić became the most unfortunate match ever after losing two great opportunities.
Magnificent Peter Cheh is one of the reasons that the Czech National Assembly won't miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football will make about 200 million CZK.
Since the first few moments, the game has been very tense.
Both teams experienced difficulty in holding combinations; the game spent most of the time in the centre of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure on the master team in the first time, and the long-term attacks on the defence line were closely intertwined by the Czech defence attorneys.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students established a human shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
They thus wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, the prayers of the students before entering the building were followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect the nuclear programme of their country at the price of their own life.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had indicated that everything showed that Iran had not left any attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
Possible attacks on nuclear facilities in Iran were discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, the students prayed before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, followed by a death prayer for both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at paralysing the Iranian nuclear programme, the objectives would be, according to the Israeli press, the installation of both Isfahan and Nathans, where uranium enrichment was being carried out.
Eating of children suffering from obesity: no breakfast and no farm for dinner
More than a third of the children between the ages of 9 and 13 weigh more; while 9 per cent of school children are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to a recent study, obesity children usually come from unwholesome families.
Once again, we see the importance of environment and patterns of behaviour associated with man, for his or her healthy development.
For example, it is almost twice as likely to appear on the table of children suffering from obesity as it is in families with children of normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children suffering from obesity at dinner had a survey on the eve of an educational event called Obesity, which was no accident.
Moreover, the families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports, but this is true of most of the families of modern school children -- only 15 per cent of the children said that their parents could find time for sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last school year, involving nearly 900 elementary school students throughout Bohemia.
Obesity event - this is not an accident that took place for a second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company V
To date, over 12,000 students from grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and a sufficient sporting load are the main determinants of a rapidly increasing number of children who suffer either from excessive weight or from obesity.
"For example, only half of those polled said they were eating five times a day, according to the breakfast lunch scheme, and that's one of the preconditions for a proper diet," says one of the findings of the study.
No lunch and no farm at night
Experts warn that even relative details, such as the regular time of family breakfast, are important to healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of school children are breakfasting together.
Most families do it alone.
The worst discovery is that in every tenth family, people don't even have breakfast.
Still, breakfast is the basis for a proper day-to-day diet.
The study showed that roasted foods are more commonly used in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks cool drinks every day (70%).
While more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure decreases to more than half, to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were invited to make their own menus on the basis of proposed products and based on their tastes and preferences.
“Chinese children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the ideal for healthy nutrition.”
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat and sweet food.
“A special concern is the high incidence of sweet cool drinks,” says the final part of the study.
As the main dinner meal, the pasta won the bird with a small weight.
However, children showed little interest in beans, fish, and vegetables.
Seeking a Healthy Life - Style
The study also showed that children were prepared to change their eating habits, provided that they were provided with relevant information.
“Many participants in the monitoring team have shown that there is a significant shift in preference for healthy food when they complete the questionnaire after the Oxy lecture is not an accident”, says the outcome of the project.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet cool drinks, and more children began to prefer water.
In addition, the children were more likely to notice birds and fish as the main dish, limiting the number of sweets and drinks.
It's also supposed to be a good psychologist, and it's said by professionals.
In the first article on training for the stackers, I visited the volume of information in the introductory classes.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Lectures by three experts in this field; advice on the choice of clothing for non-standard figures; and seminar on how it works in real life.
There's more.
The closer we are to the final examination, the more information and practical assignments are expected.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is truly full of information.
This time with Alecka, the director, (no man at all) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
In one short neck, in another Maltese figure without the right shape, another weighs more than the norm.
Theist must know how to effectively reduce the wide shoulders, add the neck or the volume missing.
We have been advised to emphasize the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, women of the upper breast and thigh and narrow waist, and not to put too much on them.
For example, if the difference is so large that the soup or trousers cannot be picked, it is worth at least one thing to put on order.
You clearly will not regret the investment because the ideally seated clothes are invaluable.
In a bookstore, you're going to feel a lot better than the one that's always leaving, running, buying a waist, etc.
Malchiaters, on the other hand, may wear clothes with rushs, appetites, stitches or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I'm glad I've got a week to realize.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we've got.
Each participant had to come up with two appearances for any celebrity, one for the day and one for the evening.
We have to take their modern appearance into account, their style in dress and shape.
I have to wear Miranda Kerr, which you may know from Victoria's ad campaign, to the Secretariat.
I'm happy for myself because it's much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who recently recovered to a ton (see if I'm overdoing) or a very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut our clothing out of magazines or find it online, print it and process it with graphics programs.
Mudborn - the result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to graphic imagery.
It is important to keep graphics in your head.
It is not only wearing real people, but creating product pages in magazines (based on special guidelines such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what Mario Camenick, the secretary and designer, told us.
But it was only Sunday.
A Clergy Needing a Common Knowledge
Saturday's lecture, full of information on the shape of the figure, rekindled three specialist guests in the field.
Stilist, Honza Poronena; fashion designer, Jakub Plunk; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminds us that fashion is an illusion and a stimulant has to use this fact.
A good stoicist can use one item of clothing in a different way.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a coat-timer can be worn in a regular way, on top of jeans and t-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on a bare body, without too much too much as a dress.
Another possibility is to roll a sleeve or lift a collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"play with him," he said.
Whatever the case, I appreciated the advice, "You need to know the rules perfectly for your work."
Then you can start breaking them,' Jakub said to us.
Here I finally figured out why we're going to have all the definitions and rules that combine with what and why, whereas in fashionable magazines we often see a different kind of thing.
Not to mention fashionable displays.
From Ben, photographer, I've found out that a steelman has to have more lights than the number of photographs he needs to take.
Thus, for a fashionable review on 10 pages (equivalent to 10 suits), I must be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that the subject of dress in this picture often looks and works in combination with others in a different way from the reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we make an image.
Honza Pomporna confirmed that often image and style were half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing eye, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of the sylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even well-known people often think it's too much (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something and what they look like a second time).
And if someone at last allows us to create their style, we should expect them to give us a different size (less) than what they really are.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids were writing anything about some kind of famous ceiling/shopper, etc.
In the Sunday of Honza and Mario, the emphasis was on the fact that it was not enough for the priest to understand fashion and be able to fend for himself.
Our work basically consists of association with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to condone them, nor to hold to their own opinions.
"If the manager asks you to see her clothes and add some nice things, you can't throw all her wardrobe, told her that her clothes are terrible."
"I want you to find a few things you can commend and say you can wear them," Mario says.
He also showed us that a particular worker bag should be inserted.
It's the bag you put around the waist to wear everything you need.
Apart from obvious things, such as scissors, sticky beaks, or English pints, it should have a nylon thread (colds use it in filming certain items, such as a bag or hat), special cleps to tie the tissue on the back if the clothes are too large (bullets and similar objects are forbidden because they wear clothes) or a coat set.
To distract ourselves from the lectures and to gain some practical experience, we learned how to put on the shoes properly.
Even during a studio survey where the floor is smooth, the soles can get hurt -- not to mention the images on the street.
And then we got a stick.
You don't have to touch a knife shoe so you don't ruin it.
It requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario commended my work.
Those skills didn't come to my mind.
It's only part of what we heard during part two of the weekend.
I'm beginning to realize that being a professional styler isn't as easy as talking.
V Need for Speed: The escape takes place in America.
Overview
What was to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of totally inappropriate and careless errors.
The ambitions were somewhat satisfied, but it doesn't matter because no one clearly wanted to do extra work.
Before the new version was released, the subheading "Fleeing" had high expectations.
It was expected that it would open the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the game.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, there's a lot of difference, after all, from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression is that there are some unnecessary mistakes that have been in this series for several years.
That is, it is not a mistake but an unexplained laziness of the processors.
The adventure starts very well.
You're becoming part of a story whose main hero, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You're on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York City first.
There are some interesting features in this design.
The march consists of 10 stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race goes along its own route, and individual stages go through a variety of different and interesting environments.
Therefore, there is no feeling that the game is going on the same way all the time.
Despite the fact that the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series, it is pleasant to look at some highways.
Still, playing does not give you strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, the autumn suburbs or high up in the snowy mountains are pleasant.
In addition, the race occasionally revives unusual detail.
For example, in the desert you are caught in a sandstorm that reduces visibility considerably.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to get under the bench.
Individual races are fairly well organized.
There's only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a time, you are trying to chase several rivals, and then you are trying to improve your time, or you are competing with one opponent.
Among other things, you have encountered the police from time to time, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components are new.
It's just interactive animations, where Jack runs away for a lot of time and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
While it's surprising that these fragments are much less than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out it's good for the game, because it's not a problem; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more attentive.
The race model follows previous models.
It means that it no longer represents something special, but that cannot be considered a drawback.
If you're looking for a simulation of real life, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.
Yet, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic races, although better options can be found in the market.
So far, everything's very good.
But after a while, problems start to start.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
It's not the game you're expecting, but if you have no idea what you're going to do with an object, how will your car behave, something's not right.
Usually when you run or drive by cars in dense streams, you sometimes get a little bit touch over another machine, but sometimes, in almost similar situations, your car starts smoldering.
Or the vibes are broken.
It's not that important because of a system of restarting, but it's enough to spoil fun.
The restarts are arranged in such a way that if you break or leave the track far away, the game returns you to the point where it's interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you're using them all, you're gonna have to start a race from the start.
It's useful if something doesn't work, but you can't rely on it completely.
Sometimes restarting is not enough, and you have to learn the visuality of a particular section of the race.
An important failure to play is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be driven in a certain way, or you're just not proud.
In other cases, you meet a civilian car at a certain location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you come first, fifth, five seconds earlier, or a minute later.
This is especially frustrating when you see your rival travels easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you're in there, the cars are already located so that you either have to drive them or drop the speed.
It doesn't matter when you're there; it's arranged that the situation always happens just in front of your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
During the game, you discover several places where, regardless of the time, the same rival will chase you around in the same place.
It's especially obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge, where you're going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your rival has to stand before you no matter what.
The fact is, when he goes in front of you, he's hurting you with the review, which results in one or more accidents at the site.
You can understand trying to make a game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get angry.
Too bad, because despite the simple driving model, the game is attentive and sometimes so rich in events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what doesn't let you miss -- a concept with fifty unique routes, a sequence of races or something.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to keep track of the gaskets, since they can be replaced by your car, even though most of the time you already have is quite sufficient.
Machines are divided into three categories.
Sports machines are suitable for cities; powerful U.S. machines for direct cut-off of the highway; and exotic superpowers for technical driving, for example, on an inflamed mountain highway.
The main mode mode mode is closely linked to the gamenge mode mode mode; this is the individual section race that you will find in the course of the game.
Here you win your own personal business, both medals and glasses, common to manglenges and story.
Many possibilities are available for higher levels of driving, ranging from car to profile.
In addition, the profile is linked to the Autolog online function, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with those of other players and provides public relations.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; that's an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car are in the tunnel of the subway (let's think so) where you hang on the rails in the dark (let's think so).
Your speedometer shows the figures of 150 to 200 km/h (let's think so) when suddenly a subway train arrives at you, turning your car into a scrap breast.
For several days our version of the game has been discussing whether no one thought at the time of the game's creation, or whether our creators really think we're so glamorous.
The technical composition of the game is nothing special; however, the general impression of the video show is generally pleasant, sometimes amazing.
Although it is a pity that, in some critical times, the quality of the record is sometimes rather strong, it is declining.
This is especially true of incidents involving a large number of participants, where you would not be particularly helped by a good record.
The sound is fine; the sound is for the lover.
In order to please the widest possible youth audience, in the sound editor 'Wreats of various styles'; however, few people are likely to buy a game because of its music.
General impression of Need for Speed: Run was rather disorderly.
If the game were to avoid manifestly unnecessary errors, we could honestly say that the Run is the best part of NFS over the past few years.
In any case, the game leaves a sense of incompleteness.
Of course, it's a great fun, but you'll be prepared to make the flaws blind you like an airport light.
The Chores of Carlaov University will be at the concert "The Students in the Barath."
The third consecutive year of Festa Academia, it is proposed that the international day of the student and the anniversary of the bartender revolution be combined with the music event.

Ambassador to the EU of Vicenov:
The reputation of the sceptics is that of the euro.
“The Treaty of Lisbon has caused considerable divisions among individual organizations”.
"I didn't expect such a brutal war."
“It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, it will calm down and all the players will get used to their new roles”, Ambassador Milena Visinov of the EU firmly started his lecture at the Faculty of Law.
It proved to be of clear and open about Europe in the first part of its lecture, where it described individual EU institutions and their relations so easily and clearly that many lecturers from the KW Law Department would be envious.
Moreover, Visinov commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"The critics said he was a simple, grey office mouse that could not play any role; I must say, everyone was amazed at how well he handled his role."
“He is a person who can listen to the twenty-seven participating countries at the same time and who has a clear understanding of where the EU needs to be developed.”
She explained her new position as a representative of international relations and security issues as a response to the question, “Who is the European Union??” by what number do I need to call?
Nobody's gonna ban our cheeses.
The focus has continued to be on the EU key programme in the past, the present and the near future.
She called the Czech presidency a successful year ago.
The Czechs were dealing with an impending financial crisis; they were addressing the crisis and organizing a summit of the Eastern Partnership.
She said that the resignation of the Government at that time was a negative phenomenon that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic is now very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador has said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have led to an ongoing overthrow.
Moreover, it is necessary to adopt a new EU seven-year budget, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which are smaller; all these issues will be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador reminded the key slogans she brought to Brussels, "O Europe, Understandable Language."
"I really don't like cuts, foreign words and jargon, which no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our classes of cheese.'
It also intends to make more efficient use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
A Multi-mile-old Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs consider the Euro-sceptics; as well as people who are more negative than the positive sides of things.
She wants more Czechs to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that there are several factors to blame: the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; and, at the same time, the support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, it noted the strength and cooperation of the Vichegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the words join us, the Frenchman says to me, "Hey, what about the assembly, again the Weshengrad Group?" And he's not happy.
In the future, Wicenova expects mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policies of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considered the idea to be two-speed, if not more realistic, in Europe.
"We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Shengen zone, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that countries that want to unite should be united, whereas those that do not wish may remain sidetracked."
“The number of such institutions will rise; it will indeed be two-speed Europe”, Wicenov expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all countries parties and not only those of the Eurozone.
brand history:
IBM innovator is entering the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses the strategy of IMB, the closest is likely to be a "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's sustainability was laid down by her first boss, Thomas J. Watson's dreamer.
He believed that many of the world’s problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Dumai!" thus became the image around which the future of the giant was being launched (as well as the name of his internal journal, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture Watson has carefully built.
"For us at IBM, long-term thinking means constant movement for the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because he remained faithful to his original values, although he did not fear to change everything around him.
In our first hundred years, this has enabled us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more," says the current leader of Samuel J. Palmizano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
Watson approached the issue of employee care in the 1930s, just as Bata in the Czech Republic was one of the first American employees to have paid leave, insurance from an employer, elegant uniform, and a complex bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship of IBM with consumers is equally advanced.
It was one of the world's first companies to eliminate all discrimination, which gave her a great choice.
Agrees with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan whereby a woman, Virginia Rometti, replaces Palmizano next year.
She worked for IBM for thirty years; she is now a director of sales, marketing and development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, which have produced many future innovations.
No wonder many ideas work for a company of about half a million people.
Good reputation organization
A firm ' s strong position in business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the outset, from the perspective of the IBM concept, it was more an organization than a technology company," said the Economist Professor of Harvard Business School and author of the IBM book, Rosabet Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a technology-friendly company," adds Jodge Coloni of the Forrester Research consulting company.
According to the company itself, there is a difference between entering and creating the market.
In one hundred years, IBM, or Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnology.
It owns the largest number of patents for all American technology companies, and five of its employees received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, a bank card, a financial swap, a bar code and a diskette.
With $220 billion, market capitalization data show that IBM this year became the second largest technology company (first of its number, Apple), losing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Watch forward.
Not all its products came to the taste of the customers and came into the age, for example, IBM failed with its OS/2, Progiy's online service and PCjr's computers.
"If your business is driven forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," said Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundation on several platforms -- if they don't work, it refuses them.
This is different, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, who bases and survives the fall on Windows, his operating system.
Advanced technology
The main IBM revenue comes from services, about one fifth of each comes from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990, it was twice as small as that of capital, it was the strongest manufacturing company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion of low-income assets, while at the same time investing 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the world was first hit by the current economic crisis.
IBM is following the example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of shares of IBM has increased to record 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have grown steadily.
IBM's Corporate Vision is to change everything but its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis arises, this flexible giant will deal with the situation.
IBM history: From crude knife to space missions.
IBM was founded in New York 100 years ago.
It came to be called IBM in 1924, and it was originally called a brand used for company offices in Canada and South America.
The basis for future IBM was a merger of four companies, whose history begins in the 1880s.
They owned technologies such as legendary clocks, i.e. hours that record time when staff come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was a businessman, Charles Randet Flint, who also led the company’s Board of Trustees until 1930.
Flint hired the director of the competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The manager then moved the founder of IBM into shadow, Watson's idea, and remains the basis for unbounded corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, it is clear from the name, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, ranging from cheese knives and meat to cashiers.
In the first four years, Watson’s revenue management doubled to $9 million, and a large-scale expansion of the company began on all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that, almost forty years later, his director's seat was occupied by his son Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first language of programming.
In the 1960s, both the staff and IBM computers assisted NASA in monitoring space flights - Mercure, Saturn, and 1969 - man flights to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family, IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers by the Chinese company Lenovo, while purchasing a consulting office, PricewaterhouseCoopers, so that it had a full focus on consulting and high-value-added services.
IBM has made great progress over the past three years with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its objective is to make reasonable use of technologies in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently introduced a Smarter Company platform that helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
The IBM tradition is powerful even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be held simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also manages a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters of central and eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-level research group on speech recognition is also working.
He said to his unbelieving husband:
Yveta, leave yourself a fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Rykharjav (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richharge (53), became a bodyguard and lover of Joseph Bartosova (45), Darwin was still hoping that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has set out clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can go home, but not as my partner," explained Rykharagesov.
When Darwin Rykharaj summer gave blood to Bartoshova in her home, she may have had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Even though she forced Yvethu to leave Rzychan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly confessed that he loved her.
After some time, Darina gave up pretending to have reconciled to her husband's novel, and now she's finally forgiven him.
I don't care who his wife is sleeping with.
Even if there were ever to be a Rekhtarge and Bartoshov, his wife would not accept him with open arms.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will expel him."
"One day he'll finish his days, not like my beloved, lost and found old fool, but the person with whom he connects me," said Rykharzov, adding that she had already been freed from her husband and was insisting only on a single note.
Until Joseph had anything to do with his wife’s rejection of him.
"I respect the decision of my wife."
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife has decided to leave a marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union is still functioning; I am responsible for repairing, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly normal, except we don't do any more bed," said Blesk’s Cyctorage.
He claims that if he finds new love, he won't interfere with it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who has a friend with her.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Egypt, and I'm completely responsible," concluded Joseph.
Women's worst habits: Do they surrender you?
When you ask men to call certain typical bad female habits, they usually list them all.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines of several women's habits that make men angry?
Schöpping
Does your second half complain you're always shopping?
You need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping at big sales?
If so, your shopping may be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they have to control some of their bumps.
And yet, who of you would refuse to walk around the clothes store in search of ideally seated clothes and illustrations (preferably in various colors) in the exemplary?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a hell of a hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait outside...
End-of-life grievances
"I'm too fat?"
"I need to drop at least five kilograms-- maybe I should start making gymnastics?"
"You still coming to me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you join a group of women who are confused in their appearance.
Not that you should stop watching yourself, but many men literally have allergies about the spouse’s constant complaints about his appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more complaints are raised, the more women resent them.
Most important, order and cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
The dusting of glass, the cleaning of dust, the soft floor, the firewood, the cleaning of baths -- at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for coming on a clean cafe in dirty boots; children for being dirty in a clean sink; and fingerprinting on a window window in a living living room that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this “disgusting, ” try to realize that extremes are not good enough; and that in your family, order and cleanliness should not stand in the first place.
Undeserved pursuit of purity can threaten your relationship as well as your family.
Willing to Command
"Break your laundry in the basket."
"You're going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Model towels must not lie on the floor."
If you make a comment to your spouse a few times a day, he may feel that way.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood it, women wouldn't have to run it so often...
Spikes
Some women like to gossip, insult, and entertain others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk about who, where, who, and why.
From time to time, I guess each of us has a gossip.
Let us be frank, it seems to be the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossipers, women, who often gossip and despise others, who, especially in the women's workforce, pose a greater threat to their surroundings.
The results of the broadcasts of the Yung and Voreček helped Philadelphia win.
On Monday's NHL match, two successful Hickey attacker Jaromere Yigra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the ice of Caroline and again became the most successful Czech match player.
In both cases, Claude Jira used the experience of a 30-year-old star; he added another gear and was declared the best player of the match.
The two results of the match were also part of a team with Yagrom Jakub Voreček.
After the match, Yigris told foreign journalists that he had predicted a wonderful evening for Jiro.
"I told him to go to the match, he'd kill a hat trik."
"I felt it."
"Then you feel things like that," explained the Yigris, after whose actions, Jir did a goal at the earliest opportunity given by Fleiers.
A little later on, the second team also had a "other trail".
Harrickines Vorecak has the devil and has given it to Maxim Talbot, who's hit between circles.
One second before the first break, Patrick Dayer’s home player reduced the gap with multiple advantages, but in the beginning of the second time, Fleiers was once again led.
Especially Jiru.
Following the successful delivery of the Yang, he killed a third goal; thereafter, his impact was transformed into the fourth leg of Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with it."
"I don't mean to say that he's the best league player, but he's definitely in the three best," said UNDP, commending his centre.
"I never thought at the end of my career I'd be playing with a hockey player like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," added Yig.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with the help of Tumo Ruut and the Duyer Toolbar, reducing the gap to one head.
Further complications prevented Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger did great work in our area."
"He hit the highway, "I hurried, and Reed went to the far edge."
"I've been aiming at him and glad it worked," Vorčka described her impression on the last needle of the match.
The victory took Philadelphia first place in the Eastern Conference.
The Protector of Montreal Chee Jaroslav Spakek failed to complete the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period because of the injury of the upper body.
Together with the experienced lawyer, Canadans lost their dual advantage and lost 2-3 after a series of panels.
Tomas Plekanek couldn't kill during one of their attacks.
More than the missing glasses, the house coach was upset by the large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the others were young people."
"No matter what happens, we can't do anything about it, we just have to accept it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement, it was amazing, and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the devil out of our zone."
"That was our weak side," added P.K. Subban's lawyer
After 30 attacks by Czech needles, Onja Paulitz helped Winnepaggs win Tampa Bay 5:2.
Golly Jets, who interrupted a five-minute series of wounds, was beaten by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five government travel agencies were able to work in the former Czechoslovakia: ʹedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea, and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, the tourist agencies of that time were mostly selling tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Krim on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was between 1962 and 1972, when we were able to travel to Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslav regime then returned to the West, resulting in considerable restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A major paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. and Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual travel to socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovakian citizen wanted to go on his own, for example to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was needed from that country; a second individual trip was not possible.
At that time, tourist agencies were offering travels to the West, but they had to either stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or have "good friends" at the agency.
And that was not all.
Currency permission was needed for travel to the West, and was not granted to politically insecure people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovakia currency was not freely converted; without a foreign exchange permit it was impossible to obtain money (Western currency) for a Western trip.
Most of the Czechs spent their home leave, which resulted in large numbers of cottages and summer houses, the habit is maintained today.
Since 1989, tourism in Czech Republic has thus experienced a real revolution.
While prior to 1989, GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our journeys, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
A great paradox that we no longer realize is that until 1989 we were unable to visit freely the most popular Croatia now, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need to obtain visas to neighbouring countries in Western Europe was lifted, leading to a great wave of short journeys mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't have had their journeys west, and everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, since their income was then insufficient for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring food (conserves, sals, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a free convertible Czech crown, and after decades our tourists can finally buy a Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand for travel facilities has allowed regular flight by charterers, and air travel has now become extremely cheap by means of volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, no visa was needed to visit almost all the developed worlds except the United States, making our journeys even easier.
The next major event in the history of travel since the revolution occurred in 2000, with a great demand that led to the historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country in Thailand.
Since then, direct chartering flights have been carried by Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flight from the Czech Republic will be sent along twelve exotic routes.
Currently, some 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another major event during this period, which symbolizes our development since the revolution, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished the need to obtain visas for Czech tourists.
For the first time in 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their leave abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroons per person on overseas leave, including their costs at destination.
The general assembly must elect a president, the pope's threat returns.
For about five months, Czech football had no president, and there was a risk that successor Ivan Hasheck, the head of the Czech Association for Footballs, would not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on the rules to be followed.
Without this, no ballot for one of the three candidates will begin.
Indraggian Richl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomash Pazlik are eager to lead Czech football.
As he left his post in June, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, the Hasheck era has once again loaded football in a race between the two Houses of the Association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This was quite obvious on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
Members of the general assembly therefore arrived at the National House in Prague, Smikh because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who was entitled to vote in the general assembly, only by legal representatives or also by officials who were given powers.
Since then, part of the recommendation of the Institute of the State and Rights that representation based on the powers granted should not be possible.
Disputes over electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board has also not been very helpful, although it is a matter that is largely being dealt with in its meetings, both ordinary and extraordinary.
Presentations of voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do you get to the 3rd round and avoid sweating?
“The point is whether to follow the established standards or find another model”, says one of the Vice-Presidents of FAR Dushan Liberty, who represents professional football in the administration of the association.
Based on the model envisaged by the statute, the winner of the 3rd round was a candidate who had received great support from the Chamber from which he was a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree to compromise that he would be the winner of the election, with the largest number of votes cast in both Chambers.
The Czech side insists that, in the overall ratio, the winner must obtain at least two thirds of the votes.
"At least the two previous rounds would then have lost their meaning; it would have totally rejected the concept of the two houses," Freedom agreed with Moravia's arguments, and he said it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with the existing rules.
Tomas Patzlik agreed to his opinion a few times, although the election rules, as defined by the statutes, had been assessed by Pelta more than by other candidates.
"I would like the elections to be held as far as possible by statute."
"I want to avoid all possible representational foolishness, like at the previous general meeting," says Victoria Plzen, the first candidate who is a candidate; and in his remarks, he basically contradicted Pelte.
Pelta remains an optimist.
He believes that the new President will be known in Nimburg, and he also hopes that future candidates will cooperate constructively.
"All emotional defeat will be calmed after today's anticipated national assembly at the European Championship."
"Futball will be back on a happy eve, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Jablanc, with three candidates with the best experience in football management at both the professional and regional levels.
Rachl's more of a restraint.
"I look forward to an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"It is not between Bohemia and Moravia, but there is an attempt to deliberately adapt the rules."
"It could cause another breakdown in the general assembly."
"I hope common sense wins," said Rachel.
It was not enough time for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some, some negotiations have taken place directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was to be delivered, in addition to others, by Vice-Presidents Daliber Kucher and Ryhla to Podgorica, did not leave Prague this morning because of technical failure, an alternative was found to bring part of the executive committee to the scene of the re-playing match.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which is expected on Wednesday, can be decisive.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like to see an agreement between the opposing parties of the most powerful sports association in the country.
Many are at stake: government subsidies; football credit; and the planned general meeting .STV with a new Czech sport post-Suzki financial problems.
Pascick takes part in the presidential struggle because he sees no suitable candidate.
If, before the extraordinary general assembly, the head of the T-shirts, Plsen Tomash Patzlik, saw a strong candidate meeting all his requirements for the President of the Futball Association of the Czech Republic (FA–R), he would not even claim a high office.
"If I had been a decent candidate, I'd have fought for him and didn't participate in the fight myself."
"But such a man has not yet been found," said Patzlik à TK.
The Pazlik's motive for the fight against Miroslav Pelt and Jindrjikh Raichl is to try to prevent Pelte from entering FAčR.
Moreover, Patzlic stresses that if won, he will be President only until 2013, when another general assembly is scheduled.
In the future, he'd like this position to be occupied by an experienced top manager who's not too involved in football.
"I've talked to several people that could be remembered."
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say at the moment that they don't even want to be involved in Czech football."
"I should like to change that view," he said.
At present, the main difference between Patzlika and Pelta relates to the latter ' s relationship with Roman Berbrom, President of the regional football association in Plzen, and Berbour is a man of conflicting reputation who, behind the scenes, is known as a powerful lobbyor capable of affecting the voices of delegates of the general assembly.
The staff therefore finds it unacceptable that Pelta be president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football won't move forward."
"With Berbra's support, a capable businessman, it would have been even more detrimental to football," said Patzlic.
He suggests that the name Pelta was recorded a few years ago while listening to telephones in the investigation of the corruption case; Pelte escaped a sentence.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would have brought to football."
"And as we would have looked in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Patzlic, he doesn't mention his earlier statement that he's "sold a club of Pilsen if Pelta becomes president."
If the Patzlik wins Thursday, he could present future cooperation with the Pelta.
This view is shared by another candidate, Raichl, who was supported by Patzlik before the general assembly in September over the fiasco.
"He would be the first to whom I would turn."
'He's very capable.'
"I can present it in the head of the assembly."
"But he can't run an association."
'I don't mind what I'm not talking about either,' said the Patzlik, who had attracted a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of the Judicial Brigade led by Ludek Macelej, who had been replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Patzlic claims he's risking the management of the association.
He recalls his experience with the management of private companies; since last summer, he had run the Pilsen team, which in May had celebrated its first triumph in the league.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support her change."
"To limit the influence of certain groups of persons who are inclined to influence the disciplinary and appeals council, which leads to a hideous situation," said Patzlik, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Director of Sparta, Daniel of Krzetinski.
One of its priorities will be the strengthening of the relationship between FAR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will lobby at the highest political level the allocation of more money to the lottery sport.
"This is one of the key points the new president is supposed to address."
"If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money is going," he said.
He does not consider his relationship with the Plzej Club as a burden, although he claims that President FA - R should be independent.
Helta is connected to the Apples, and Raichl is connected to the Doll of Prague.
"It's not perfect."
"And yet I see no point in hypocritically passing on my shares to the Pilsian Club to someone else, since I'm going to go back there in six months," says Patzlic.
Pelt promised new FACATR rules that would help to avoid the Election Pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for the new FA-R regulations in order to avoid disputes over election rules in the future.
Before the negotiations on Thursday in Nimburg, Jabontitz's operative remains an optimist and believes that the attention given to the electoral struggle will significantly affect today's expected success of our soccer team.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the election at the last moment before the last general assembly, a two-month delay that could thus be useful to him to stand up for his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been at football for a long time, and they expect the President to be known on Thursday."
“They feel that now is the time for someone to take the lead in the association”, claims the person mainly associated with the Appletec club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to assume that he's experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hasheck.
"It's unfortunate that rules that weren't as perfect as we all thought were adopted by the general meeting in June."
"Had the different ways of representation were not adopted, we would have had a president since September," said Pelta.
He referred to the copying of a core civil association document as a false objective for delegates.
"If I become President, I will consider it my personal task, and I am going to take on personal responsibility if this attempt is unsuccessful."
"This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist," claims Pelt.
Furthermore, he says that he does not try to identify himself against a rival background.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Jindrich Rychl, whom he valued for his legal education; he was fully aware of the fact that his candidate was to become his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Patzlic, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been on football for over a year and has made some progress."
"No matter what happens, his attacks were unfavourable, and many people have surprised the methods of his election campaign."
“There are also some of them who now question his true identity,” Pelta said about his competitor, and Pelta himself claims that he is true of the declarations he made in September.
He considers his main weapons to be the knowledge of football, from the lowest to the national gathering.
The National Collection must represent the entire football community.
"I would also try to put an end to all incidents, starting with the case of the goddesses or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"Just after that, I'd focus on the negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee sufficient money for the entire football," the four-year-old candidate said ?TK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football chapter would not entail the dismissal of staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of the individual staff." This was his message to Strahos, where the prolonged period of inter-government has caused a sense of nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general assembly, he believed that delegates would come to Nimburg on Thursday.
"If the only controversial question is how to hold elections in the third round, we can deal with that."
"Foutball needs the trust that he can get by finally selecting his leader," says Pelta, who, two days before the key day of his career, remains an optimist.
Rychl promises that his leadership will be active
If, at a meeting on Thursday of Jindrjy Reich, acting as Vice President, he becomes President of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association are heard to be disheartened.
Raichl promises that if he's picked, there's going to be a lot of work to do.
He wanted to establish changes in the system and make executive committee members responsible for specific areas in football.
He also promises to address the problem of the gods; improve the relationship with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money to football; and continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national assembly, professional football, and football events for young people."
"I mean, I don't mean to say that I'm going to do it myself," said Rachel in his interview for the "TK."
“I am a team player, and I want to distribute powers in an executive committee so that each member will focus on a particular area.”
"I'm carefully assigning tasks so that in each of these segments, football takes a big step forward."
“It's probably not going to be like many people because it's going to mean hard work, and not just critical work of others”, he added.
The atmosphere of criticisms in football movement allegedly made him doubt his candidature.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there is any meaning in this; and that I will not be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every step," he explained his doubts.
"Not least, many people told me I shouldn't give up, or others will come."
"It's the trust I can't put down," he said.
Moreover, he says his motive is to continue the work he started with Hasek.
"A lot of work has been done over the past two years, and I don't want to cancel it all."
"There have been trials that can produce results in a few years, and I do not want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be elected, the situation in the Association could return to the one before Hashaka.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's not what Mr. Pelta's competence is."
"He's surrounded by people who do football so that it's available only to the chosen."
"I can be largely accused, but certainly not of subjectiveity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just an elected minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he refutes the charges that he will be only the President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people try to argue otherwise, I plan to do the most for Moravia."
“It is time for us to think about dividing the second league into the Czech and the maritime parts, the winners of which would continue the fight in the first league.”
"It will prevent the current situation where there are only three moral teams in the League, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Rachel.
While the manager of the Pilsen Club, Thomas Pazlik, took part in the presidential struggle, Raichl did not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"At least, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its Vice President, and I see that I have made some obvious progress," said Rachel, and by his success he saves tens of millions of kroner contracts in bad contracts, negotiation of TV contracts, and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he is partly guilty of the lack of unity in association.
Claiming that Pelta was “distinguished from the process of returning creditworthiness to Czech football”, he considered another rival, Pazlica, a strong candidate, who had what to offer.
"There can be no doubt that he did a great job this year in Pilsen."
"If he is chosen, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek did without a substantial change of staff on the committees."
"He wouldn't distort facts for his advantage," said Rachel about his rival.

Child basins with universal fibre optics and status basins in Budapest, travelers can test the incredible waters of Europe, and relax the congested body in the Jacquoise after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder was unable to do his research tours for the past 18 months: without his own bathing suit.
She was lying on her back in water, looking up with a taste of painted domes, going to the marble cherries waiting for her at the edge of the basin and being loved by carefully restored swimming pools in the Arnevo style.
It had hurried to add each revered pool to its notebook, with important building and history details.
The historian of Meder’s architecture examined more than 200 swimming basins -- and now collected impressions in his recently published book Badfreuden (Balcon), where everything came from public basins in Munich to the historic bathtubs in the Black Forest and the “functional concrete” in Towns.
It was visited by the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and by one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia, in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
The 46-year-old author is a genuine buying culture enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but it's different in water.
The only flaw is that diving worshipers must tolerate blue cafe tiles and the smell of chlorine, whereas runners can breathe the deceptive smell of the pine forests, or listen to the joyful cheering of the birds in the park.
"One thing I asked myself was why swimming pools should always be so horrible," says the Vienna Meder.
"So I started to collect beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The swimming in the pool and the spent oil in the sauna, a health factor in the baths, is so important because, in Merder’s view, all emotions are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on this kind of work.
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is strikingly reflected in high ceilings, color tiles, and tramplins.
The illustrated "Bood of Buy" on 190 pages contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of the oasis of health, and makes you want to jump into the water.
A water collector, Meder, found some outstanding copies during the study in Hungary.
She found abundant nitrate water in her cartel cave (Michelz-Tapolce Cave) and a thermal bath filled with tern, in a bottle-shaped Városi Termálfürdö in Yasberen) as well as beautiful therapeutic baths, such as the 100-year-old Secheni dome in Budapest.
Of the many heated open basins in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is an amazing view. You can see all of Zurich from the pool on the roof or look at the snowcapped Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anthon.
Maybe the most unusual design is waiting for traders in Langenfeld, and the Aqua Congregation in Etztal looks like UFO, just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, a pair of three open - air sinking appears to be very small in the background of the Etztal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
A collection of Meder basins did not see the smell of chlorine in each basin.
A lot of the thermal baths smell like gray, and the Arpada baths in Bekeshcheb smell so much oil, that you might find it hard to believe that you're in a healthy source.
The water is almost black from the needle, which sticks to the skin as soon as you reach the pool, which is a health experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was at some point disintegrated in her search for beautiful bathing grounds, and when she tried to visit the open pool of Czech baths in Lugačevc, she found that the territory was sealed.
The domes designed by architect Dushan Jurkovich in 1902 were closed.
As the Meder looked into the visible windows of the red and white and yellow building in the Ar-Levo style, she saw the weeds growing between the cafe tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on a hot spot is the amazing navigational basin in Schwarzwald, the lander in Bad Vildbad.
The Basseys have already been through three stages of construction, and you will not only discover the neo-Roman elements of the period following construction in 1844, but also the Alhambra Mauritian Hall, which was added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Terminal Palace, the favorite navigational pool of the Iris Meder basins, was not just from Schwarzwald.
"It's a real achievement to combine such different architectural styles," said Meder.
Going to the thermal pool in such a palace is obviously a secondary occupation.
Competence of agricultural products
The Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tivs
Will Deutsche stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIGEL ONLINE, Josef Akkermann gave the working group the task of investigating the effects of speculation on the poor around the world.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans found it unacceptable for banks to bake on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that Deutche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems faced by the world's poorest people.
The findings were found in a study carried out by the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa from the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harold Shuman, demonstrates that the world commodity exchange game raises prices - and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The campaign of consumer defence is directed directly against the head of the Board of Bank Joseph Akkermann, although large banking houses, such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, trade the same.
The commodity rate was originally intended to be a means of protecting traders against price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that players have given up supply and demand rules and are being used for the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to the criticism, he promised to investigate the charges and said that no trade “is worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank”.
According to SPIGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods can be reduced or completely stopped.
Akkermann's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector.
As the bank's chief lobbyist, Akkermann has a responsibility, in Bode's view.
"The bad bank must remove from the briefcase all the investments that make the cash rate for food prices," said Bode.
“It doesn't matter whether it's about starving people or the reputations of Deutsche Bank.”
The quick reaction of Akkermann is surprising, but the director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before the end of his stay in his office.
Deutsche announced on Monday that the Chairman would not be transferred to the supervisory board as planned.
The elimination of the controversial speculation on the food market could improve its image.
Nor does he really need to care for the costs — the consequences of his successor.
Each other would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization ' s campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, the study was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
No more than 11 per cent consider the investment that makes the price of food to be acceptable to Deutche Bank.
Many banking clients would also have taken concrete steps if they had found their bank involved in such trade.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said that they thought they would close the account and move to another bank.
21st century home in Vienna
Pavelion in a New Location
Ingeborg Vincenowski
Architectural history of takeoffs, falls and happy endings: For the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, Austria won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, deserted and abandoned.
It is now being re-opened as an exhibition centre.
The Austrian pavilion, designed by Carl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glassed hills, which have been bold in expressing belief in technological progress.
Pavelion Schwanzera conquered the Grand Creek in 1958 for his light steaming steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
Finally, he became famous for the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and her sister, a cup building.
Pavelion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near the South Station of Vienna, converted and opened as the 20th Century Museum in 1962, often referred to as the 20th Century House for that reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the Museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls on which works of art could be hanged, and bad air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna gained a new home.
The house had been empty since 2001, and his condition was getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishtitz has thus far rebuilt the pavilion called the Day of the 21st Century and will be used as the Museum of Modern Art.
This museum is the branch office of the Belvedner Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday night -- a happy event in all senses.
Agnes Husslein Arco, who became the new director of the Beelveser Gallery in Austria in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Hussleyn Arco, a graduate of the Arts Department with a brilliant career as a young figure who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and eventually became founder and director of the Modern Museum in Zagreb, persuaded politicians and custodians to continue their reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was to have a permanent exhibit of the Fritz Otruba Foundation, the cafe and the bookshop, along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Hard & limited budget control
Krishanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known for, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Cecelon Joseph Olbrich, and won a competition, but he also studied at Schwanzer University of Technology, and the pavilion was a “exclusive place” where he attended the exhibition“ every week. ”
He knew of the original design and the challenges facing the building, the building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems of the last restructuring were much more serious, and the building was an energy absorber, says Krishitz.
The window sheets on the glass front were replaced, an enhanced glass wall secure glass pane was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-sight safety glass.
The steel interpretations of the thermal bridge were either reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two floor floors created a space for the new use of the building, and a light well between the building and the streets provides lighting -- an almost new building, but still a beautiful pavilion Schwancera.
The original outer doors were kept and the building was painted in an old red brown colour of protection against corrosion.
Hall of cinema just like before.
This is with strict control of the museum office and with limited budget.
"We've often found stuff that's good, cheap and approved by the museum department," says Krishanitz, pointing to the rough grass in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light despite restrictions, problems and transformations.
Krishattz recently noticed that the "Brussella" pavilion was a rough story - a typical "Capillas in the City."
Such an architecture is “neither in its place” and nevertheless wants to“improve real awareness”.
The 21st century house is in the right place, because the city planning has had some sudden luck, and the fully restructured main station dock with offices and real estate is growing around the Swiss garden.
The second happy event may take place: the second Krishanitza building, Francesca von Ghabsburg, can be supplemented by a second building and is reported to have negotiated with the city about its neighboring location in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multimillion-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has produced an anti-crisis plan to avoid winter trains being canceled.
The number of staff should double.
The cost is millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter calls and delays in trains.
Referring to the internal crisis plan, Deutsche Bahn, Bild reports that up to 2015 an investment of about Euro300 million is planned.
Investments are designed to enhance the working capacity of locomotives and railway networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of staff on their own and involuntarily engaged in snow harvesting from roads and platforms will double to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the snow and ice platforms before they start work and 90 per cent of the required fire shots between four and five hours.
Rudiger Grub, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned that the winter train could be canceled and delayed at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
In the past winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties with passenger transport, as it lacked reserves at the time of the deterioration of the weather.
Many new regional trains had been awaiting approval by the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also had to check ICE axis for many years after one of the ICE trains broke down here at the main station in Kelin.
Deutche Bank will pay many million pounds in the U.S.
The new troubles were followed by the unrest around Joseph Akkermann, Director - General of the Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a fine in the United States in many millions of pounds.
The Bank has little problem in its home country, the past industrial giant in the United States has now driven it; the Doha Bank, with headquarters in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million) to calm the disputes arising from the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem was the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of the largest banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged down credit unions.
"We are glad that we have solved this problem without appeals from the parties to the court," said representative Doyle Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not admit to be guilty.
The same thing for Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCA Debbie Matz welcomed the prompt response of both banks.
The National Credit Unions Authority (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is fighting to compensate for the billions of losses.
It's the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and the summer case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scottland and Goldman Sachs.
The doubtful mortgage bonds are the so-called securities secured by the mortgage pool.
They're backed up by domestic loans.
This decided on the fate of a number of financial companies when the real estate market in the United States burst in 2007.
The United States Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers, ordered a long life in September 2008 on the crest of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have put forward a large number of claims requiring compensation or punishment of fraud.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It accuses the 18 largest international banks that they have acquired some $200 billion of bond agreements from United States credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Bank also faces the threat of FHFA prosecution at the high cost of $14.2 billion agreements between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that a bank with headquarters in Frankfurt take responsibility for “real losses” but yet fails to specify the exact amount.
The Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett puts 10 billion dollars in IBM.
Buffett's financial guru is actively investing in IBM's IT company.
He bought shares worth more than $10 billion from March.
So far, the largest American investor, Warren Buffet, has always stated that he does not invest in a computer and IT company, because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed his view on investment in the industry.
According to Buffeta, it had to be much earlier to understand that IBM was primarily providing services and buying computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffet’s investment was viewed as a knight’s act.
IBM, the IT-industries vet is now known as the IBM fan.
In an interview with the U.S. business channel, CNBC Buffet reported that, as of March, he had acquired IBM shares in the total amount of $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding of Burkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shares of IBM shares with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM had until recently been unaware of his involvement.
He praised management, which was successful even during the financial crisis.
"They did a great job," said Buffett, referring to the management strategy.
IBM focused much of its time on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The originator of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, also offers software and advisory services, as well as powerful computers for business.
Buffett was still avoiding technology companies.
He claimed he only invested in the company he understood the business.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the manufacture of lubricants and in the construction of machinery.
Its holding of Burkshire Hathaway has its share in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Müncher Rück), along with some 80 of its own daughters.
The 81-year-old acquisition of a small textile company, Burkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and through skilled investment, built one of the world's most expensive companies.
His way of life, however, remained modest.
Making it a cult for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct for making money brought him the nickname Oracle of Omaha.
The price of IBM shares increased by one per cent before opening markets following the Buffet investment announcement.
The Blue giant, as IBM is also called, stands on the stock exchange of over $220 billion, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is his close friend.
Inevitable danger
Following the identification of the Tsvikkue, the Turkish media began to question the rule of law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of a “blood ideology” that is now rising again on the surface.
The killing of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of a right extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a response to this communication in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long forgotten fears: similar right-wing attacks on Turks have not occurred since the fire in Mellin in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There was never doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing network that has been found is of such magnitude that it is not yet fully understood.
"Breaking of blood ideology?" was the title of the Internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informer of secret services and is concerned that German authorities may be drawn into the right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded calmly, remembering the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate in this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Berlin community of Turkey celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement to hire labour in a ceremony involving German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light, as a history of success.
The education in some Turkish media was like a spoil. A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary is the title of one of the articles in the Turkish Internet portal Haber X, which comment on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriyet also didn't miss this parallel.
"It smells bad" is the name of the column Akhmet Kulahji.
He noted that people had been killed who had paid taxes and had contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and subsequent successful raids were sharply criticized at the German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors asked why the German authorities had not previously thought about monitoring suspects in the extremist circles.
Some authors have reached a rather sharp rhetoric. “If they continue to act in the same manner, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves by armed forces.”
"This will be the best self-defence."
"The world in Germany is highly dependent on how the entire network and the lawfulness of punishment will be hidden," says Selen.
The crimes in Mellin and Zolingen during the 1990s were examples of a world in Germany at risk.
The pictures of the burning ruins in Zolingen were deeply impressed by the Germans and Turks.
No other event had shown so clearly to the Turkish population that they were at risk and to the Germans that mistrust and indifference could lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of Turkish unity.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press at that time mainly condemned the German police failure following the attacks, and Helmut Kol refused to visit survivors in Mellin.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the fall of the Zolingen, but he was admitted to a memorial ceremony in Kelin by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech to calculate the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It's like he defined the value of a person by taxes that he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has again revealed the increased lack of confidence in many German Turks in the current German State.
It was clear what should be done now, in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking Scandal at Zurich Lake
Most of the leading risky policies of European banks are in Switzerland, not France or Italy.
UBS barely failed during the financial crisis, and has been struggling with both of them ever since.
Now it must be German to get him back to the right course.
Alex Weber certainly didn't think he'd have that role.
In July, following his effective resignation from the head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that he would begin his work in 2013 at the least effective position as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Major Swiss Bank of UBS; an unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was obviously thrilled, commended Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newly acquired strength, and made several friendly comments to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Filiger and Oswald Grubbel."
But it was already September that it wasn't going to be the same.
The UBS trainer in London bypassed the bank security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The Executive Director of UBS Oswald Grubbel, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Webber has been consulting the Bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he'll be chairing the board in May, not 2013.
It's not going to be easy for Alex Weber.
He's an economic professor and he's a central banker, not a traditional banker, and he's definitely going to need time to adapt.
He suddenly became responsible for the Bank's strategy, which proved once again that he had earned the title of the top bank scandal in Europe.
UBS, on the one hand, is very large -- until recently, it managed the world's largest assets -- and on the other, it hasn't been out of scandals for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank has nothing to do with it.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a good reputation.
The bank linked the image of the hidden and sustainable but at the same time the fishing manager of the asset with the ambitious goals and the desire to become the largest player in the investment banking.
As a result, UBS managed 1.6 billion in 2007, thus managing more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world,
and as an investment bank entered the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and banking professor who has long been a teacher at the University of Zurich Banking Institute, explains, "I have always given my students UBS as a model of a good bank."
"Knowing what we know now, you might ask, how could I be so wrong?"
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that UBS was doing something completely wrong.
In the middle of the year, the executive director, Peter Wuffley, who was thought to be an outstanding intelligence and also a brilliant banker, suddenly withdrew from his position.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment unit of the bank attempted to play substandard securities and had to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
Indeed, the bank was able to find investors -- but investors whose services many of the bankers would have been scrupulously abandoned -- one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, hidden in such a way that its name was not even communicated.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got a lot worse.
The Bank had to declare new billions of losses and the chairman of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, the second highest wage, had resigned in 2006.
A disaster occurred in October 2008, owing to a lack of investment during the UBS financial crisis, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank had bought UBS toxic securities for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation had paid six billion Swiss francs for a converted bond with mandatory conversion to become a bank owner.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of huge banks in a small country.
In the end, the final balance of UBS in 2007 was five times as much as all of Switzerland ' s production (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later UBS capped in a tax dispute with the U.S. and said that it was ready to transmit data to wealthy customers who might have been using the bank to avoid taxes.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of the recovery of unjustifiable business revenues plus fines.
UBS thus recognized more or less that it was an instrument of tax avoidance.
At the same time, UBS lost what has always been his advantage in fighting for wealthy customers - a secret.
After that, the Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same as it used to be.
The Executive Director and the President of the Board of Directors have resigned thereafter, and
The customer's money started.
Within a few months, the Bank lost confidence in both of its main activities - investment due to unsuccessful speculation and the management of assets through aid and the promotion of tax avoidance.
And the only thing that calmed down, and it began to seem that UBS was able to reverse the situation, how this outlawed third-party disaster happened, and the only trainer dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
Clearly, risk management in the investment division has not yet worked.
“The incident with Adooli clearly showed that risk control has not changed sufficiently”, says Martin Jansen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the biggest German banks is also certain, "UBS is that it doesn't have a risk control tool."
It is the caution that Swiss bankers have long held the world ' s largest assets, not as a risk, but as a security risk for money, whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine Republic or not.
Swiss bank safes have become a symbol of irrevocable reliability, as Lendt and Sprüngli symbolize a subtle taste of chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still in line with the image of a decent Swiss private bank, but it's a little bigger.
Its position is in itself a classic.
The bank’s main office is located in Zurich on Bunchofstrasse, which runs from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, surrounded by snowcapped Swiss mountain hats.
The buildings here are luxuries, and the rent rates for the shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Traditional Swiss Confiserie Sprüngli stores include such jewellery firms as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been in the area for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the palace of Credy Suisse and elite private banks, such as Julius Bair.
The hard door leads to the UBS lobby.
There are large leather couches along the walls, near the symbol of the bank, the big safe.
UBS knows what its customers need, is reliability.
But both of the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point, abandoned Swiss notions of a banking case - or, according to the head of a small Swiss bank, betrayed them.
He doesn't want to see his name in the paper -- like all Swiss bankers -- he's also working with two of the largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Assaxes are very active.
In his opinion, there is nothing here to add to the Swiss.
"And if there is anything, then they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking that changed the UBS, that brought him the first big profits, and then the fiasco, and no other European financial institution lost as much money in the jungles of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became evident on 15 October 2008.
“On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people carried out the largest rescue operation in the history of the country,” writes Lucas Hassig in his book Krah UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How'd you get there?
When asked by the Swiss banks, they would say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was established that was too big for a little Switzerland at the time of the merger, and it continued to grow.
The two banks that formed UBS complemented each other, one was a rich but step-by-step bank specialized in the management of the assets in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more international.
Internationalized investment banks have suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin an all - powerful wheel.
Two names are related to UBS growth: Peter Wolfffly, Executive Director of UBS Group 2001 - 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wolffly and Ospel were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulffles, outstanding intelligence, modest and understanding models and statistics, and Ospel with his internal instinct, which has passed all the way up from a bank intern."
But Ospel eventually relied on Wolfffly.
And Wolfffly could have made a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were real," Geiger says.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
The UBS remembers the meetings of the board members at which Wolffly repeated the same slogan, Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he was leading the "tournic table" to which bank success was brought.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make part of it.
UBS was the largest trading player in currency and government securities.
The authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weakness: according to the parameters in the banking terminology, “permanent income”, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failures in American mortgages.
To close the hole, UBS got involved in an adventure that almost cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and its based hedge fund invested in American substandard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that combined US mortgage-based securities and sold them further by continuing to carry risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought until summer 2007, when the American real estate market was already in the fire," says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager over another had to leave as attempts to bring the bank into order were more difficult than it had originally seemed.
The UBS positions have become a child's game with chairs and to this day remain uncertain.
Anyone taking the lead in this huge bank has almost impossible tasks.
He's got to find a strategy for a bank that went back to all the business models.
Geiger's banking analyst already has an idea of abandoning investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting your Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activities need to be significantly reduced.
The new head of the Bank of Sergio Hermotti plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually only considered a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grewbel.
He has since been able to show the character and is now leading UBS on a continuous basis, as the Zurich Bank stated on Tuesday.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to its position in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.

He also stated that Europe was unlikely to slow down the recession and that banks showed further signs of weakness.
A legendary investor, Warren Buffet, was only able to confirm these concerns, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do what it took to put an end to the crisis.
He therefore considered it too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw into the garbage basket a decade-long principle and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM, worth more than ten billion dollars, was raised during the trade price of the old company's shares by almost one percent against the trend.
Shares closed at $187.35.

Wounded ravens fill cities
The game is considered to be a troubled bird in many places, and experts today say that these very smart birds will never be able to be driven out of the city.
Some like birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and the crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but in many areas, the inhabitants are becoming more and more dirty and noisy.
The solution to the bird problem, however, has not yet been reached.
In the first symposium on crows, in the city of Lehr in East Frisia, experts argued that it was no longer possible to expel the hail from cities.
Professionals from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected hail, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The search for an expanding construction and removal of traditional tree nesting made life more difficult for birds.
The ravens are under protection.
There are large colonies in the town of Zest in Westphalia and north-west in Yever, Deepholc, Achime under Bremen and Lere, comprising over 600 parents.
The controversial project of raven shooting in Lere caused an inflexible newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described bird fishing in traps and slaughtering with sticks as special cruelty.
"No ordinary movement and dispersal." said architect and landscape designer Werner Clover of Lera.
Disposing of nests of water or tree scars often have undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert, Manfred Kaiser, from Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are scattered and large colonies are divided and distributed to other areas."
Inflammation is only possible as an exception to hospitals, homes of the elderly and schools.
"We will have to live with them."
In isolation from the surrounding areas, the problem will not be solved in the cities,” said Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
The combination of fusing birds from protected areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"The information stands instead of the binshop" was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnonologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who advocates a very different approach to birds." "We need to be sure of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational black route at Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information on life is given on the information stands on very crafty stakes.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also expressed his opinion on complaints of bird noise.
The mind of the birds and the chuckle of the birds are in legends, playing not only to use the instruments to own the pieces they're looking for, but also to make the instruments themselves.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently tested a bird’s mind on four players.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they had to knock on a plank to extract the larvae of the moth.
Without special training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone needed to make a plank.
In another experiment, creative players had to solve a more complex problem.
The researchers put a small gyrus, groovy, groovy mol into a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach the prey with the beak.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make hooks and use hooks to pick up the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have done so since their first attempt.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
The largest software producer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of its employees in China over the next few years.
A company in the Dax mail office reported on Thursday that it was about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) to invest by 2015.
"We'll create more opportunities for research and development and take thousands of people to work," said Bill McDermott in his statement, one of the executive directors of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.

Mass killings - human dimension
The tense and very good new book by Peter Engund, “Treaty and sorrow: Personal History of World War I”, begins with a long list of actors from which the heart dies.
Here is how you can read the following: Remove the page carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very close to Mr. Engund's story, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your lighthouse at a time when, like one of these men and women, you will be sidetracked and lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund - Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book that he wrote right now is unusual, it describes it, rather like "the anti-history work."
There are few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are few ambassadors, fish journalists or tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, but it explains how much "the book was about what it was like," it's about "the feelings, the impressions, the experiences and the condition of the spirit."
The book Beauty and Tragics combined military experiences of 20 more or less indistinguishable men and women from both sides of the front line, from schoolboys and welfare scientists to alpenists, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone's going to be captured, losing a hand or a leg, going crazy or dying.
They die like church candles, they add to the multitude of others, and some of them have left behind at that time.
Mr. Engund's book is a step away from the standard of historical books.
It's an amendment to the idea that the first world war was just a hard-cut war in the Western Front.
“Travel and sorrow” is an effective panorama for other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
A soldier in the book is given beads; one of them meets the Christmas of Egypt under pyramids; the unresolved problem is tsetse flies.
It's a exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling like smokeless dust.
When the canonnads are around, and you're a woman and you're at home with the kids, are you staying or running?
Anyway, who's that?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why it's necessary to fight this war.
"Frequency of facts," Mr. Engund observed, "exercises guesswork, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
The beauty and sorrow is watching the fate of people like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German High Seas.
Their history is largely derived from memoirs, letters and other previously published material.
Their lives can be frightening or exciting, but they are highly alive because of the small moments and outflows that Mr. Engund has collected.
Many of them are about deprivations and how to deal with them.
When he tells a story to a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzatz, there's an ersaz."
"Replacency, counterfeit aluminium, non-responsible rubber, paper hangings, wooden buttons."
He's continuing to talk about an anesthetic food in Germany.
He describes "the meat of the paper-plated rice welded in the rams of fat; "the tobacco made of dried roots and dried potatoes; and the shoe broken by the tree."
He notes that there were “837 registered alternatives to meat permitted in the manufacture of beans, 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories speak of honor and courage.
One U.S. observed the urge toward cruelty and said of war: "You feel that after all, this is what men have been created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, a nightly newspaper or a bestseller, and to claim that this show is civilization and your fine-tuned shirt is not covered by barbars."
On the contrary, a British soldier would notice that he was likely to die and that no one would notice or grieve.
"When a person comes to terms with the idea of self - sacrifice, he would like to think it would happen before the public," he says.
But it's the opposite, it's pretty much like a "consented man who's been hanged in secret."
Other comments relate to the decaying old Europe and to the new kinds of fear.
"The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition," says Mr. England, "the war factories."
He takes note of the arrival of someone who has been described as "a new species in the baffling of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressing and ideologically convinced mass killer in a well-crushed suit that sets up a slaughter sitting at a written table."
People act in an unanticipated manner: low actions are as much a hero.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who had tried to catch up with sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes in order to avoid service on the front lines.
"The very grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhea that soldiers bought and mulked at their genius in hopes of getting into the hospital," he writes.
"The despairers all rubbed him in the eyes, which often led to life's blindness."
With Swedish Peter Graves, Mr. Engold is flexible but non-weapony, perfectly fit for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how the war has “freed completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are starting to ask why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as the Great War and Modern Memory of Paul Fassila or novels such as the Erikh-Marie Remarca Western Front, not exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Engund's book is part of this sloppy pantheon.
His book has the most amazing finals I can remember in the bad literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he got to a page with a list of characters, pulled it out of your hand, and set it on fire.
After the previous error, a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operations, some in protective helmets.
The nighttimes from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there were to be the least people in the Zukotti Park at this time.
The operation was kept secret, except for a few high-ranking officers, the others first told us that they were going to the training.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the events, and his presence emphasized the importance attached to the operation by the Department of Police.
There could not have been a repetition of the episodes of the last weeks, such as the use of repetitive gas against the protestors, which was contrary to the Department's rules and caused a hurricane of sympathy in the public to the occupiers.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to release the Sukotti Park protestors.
The authorities were preparing themselves to watch occupation unfolded in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were held on Randels Island, counting on Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police - in the context of Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the East River Manhattan side.
The order to enter the park came at the last minute, and the source told of orders that referred to it only as "practication."
"The several cops I know, and they called on the case, didn't say they were sent to the Soukti Park," said the person who was talking about the anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Soukati Park were at the highest office in the department."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was a lesson learned from the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park but retreated to the hundreds of protestors who were swimming in front of the deadline, hearing of the plans.
The operation involved various police units, including district forces, police teams, who were usually used to control the criminal area.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as if they were at work, came and left the park during the day, making 1 hour of the night a good time for coming.
"It was right to do this when the least people in the park are in the park," he said.
Rescue vehicles with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pyk-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt-Drives, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The searchlights and advance announcements from the loudspeakers seem to have deterred many protestors.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue winds, many protestors simply collected their belongings and left.
The police reported that the tents hadn't touched 1:45 a.m., allowing protest time for the collection of items.
Other police teams, according to eyewitnesses, met in the perimeter to enter the park if arrests were needed.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the Police Department, said that this was done for their security.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police functioned and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that vehicles with TV cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went to the west through the chest of the protestors' personal effects, including bags, plastic carpets and polyethylene bags, complete clothes, the teams of the Department of Sanitation followed her, collecting what had been thrown.
Some protestors who refused to leave were taken outside, and the photos soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protestors took positions near the camp kitchen, at the park centre.
Some built the barricades, and the police entered, deliberately arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp’s epicenter had their hands clasped together.
And two people were putting themselves on trees, and Mr. Kelly said.
Rescue officers were summoned to cut down the locks.
No arrests took place in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clearance operation was completed approximately 75 minutes later, and reported to the police.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for "the breach of public order and resistance to detention," he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, Head of Department and Senior Officer of the Department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the Department's wanted police, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “did not lead the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police officers was waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cidar Street, in case they needed to enter.
The fences were put on Cortland Street, just north of the park, and on Pine Street, just south.
Observers have seen the police expand the perimeter even further than the Zukotti Park border from these positions.
At one point, observers observed a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people further out.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protestors jumped on the roof of a police vehicle, while others were reported to have released the air from the van's tires.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out from the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protestors were hospitalized.
The union of school personnel will apply to the city for dismissal.
A trade union representing hundreds of school staff who had lost their seats last month plans to su the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor pupils were enrolled.
Judicial proceedings - possibly the last resort, available to a union of the District Council of 37 trying to rescind dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, a coordinator for working with parents and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of the fact that trade union leaders called the political response to their refusal to allow the city to have access to health funds run by groups of workers to close the hole in the last spring's budget.
Urban officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the City Council hearings last month, Dennis M. Waltkot's chancellor said that dismissals were part of the budget they signed last June.
A Board member steamed and told him that nowhere in the budget had been indicated that the school support staff would be dismissed.
Representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had filed a claim notice and had warned the Department of Education that a complaint had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to formalize the claim with the Supreme Court of the State of Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City will be identified in the action and eight temporary laymen will be listed as plaintiffs, all of whom will be black or Latin American women, as are most of the assistants who lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the City Law Department, said that the city had not seen a claim and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint made at New York Times, the union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city in order to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that more assistants had lost schools because they were permanently underfunded.
He points out that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and there were few schools in Upper East Side or Tribeki, 17 school assistants lost their places in district 23 in Brownville, Brooklyn, and 46 in the Districts 8 and 9 in the Southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants at a free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim states: “It is not the areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill budget failures.”
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and she also lost her money when the city changed the way it counted additional funding for every poor student who goes to school.
The Trade Union also claims that school directors may have been introduced in a misleading language of notification allowing the dismissal of the school focal points from their parents.
The notice used the word “excess” although the “exceedance” is more often referred to when a teacher from the school's payroll is moved to the list of available employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six focal points for working with their parents were dismissed," says the draft of the claim, "and not just translated."
Mission completed, Congress ready for agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and democracies at the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the rebellion in Libya.
All you needed was to get the rebellion out, the old dictator Muamar al-Qadhafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee should consider the resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (democracy, Massachusetts) along with Senators John MacKein (Republic, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent, Connecticut), who commends the Libyans for their good rebellion and the United States troops for “for the evasion”.
“The idea of this resolution is to honour the courageous people of Libya when they begin rebuilding their country,” said Kerry.
“This confirmation of support for their democratic aspirations on the part of both parties.”
The language may seem harmless, but no further discussion on Libya has taken place easily.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and with the White House about the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the United States army in the NATO mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution allowing for the limited use of the United States armed forces in Libya.
The draft law had been rejected by the House of Representatives by a substantial majority vote of both parties and had never been put to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber also did not support a proposal that would reduce the funding of the United States operation in Libya.
This left a United States mission to something like legislative purgatory -- when Congress is quite angry to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so evil that it really knocks the ground off its feet.
Then the events provoked the indecision of the Congress
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels and on October 20, Kaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially concluded on 31 October.
The Senate can now be ready for action.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee “is admired by the people of Libya for its incredible courage and unexplained determination to be free” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners, who have participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their outstanding courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “asserts the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Would new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Board or split the legislators as the June Bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Republicans on the Committee, opposed the last version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Court of Representatives this week, the Chamber of Representatives should vote in favour of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and some democracies in Congress.
This measure, proposed by the member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlat (Republic, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or something else to be submitted to the plenary vote of the Congress of that convening.
Other legislators had not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary, but not because they had not tried.
Gudlata ' s amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments covering a wide range of issues raised by the convening.
Some duplicate, the same bill being introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, while others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments in the House of Representatives alone and a few more about “control over federal expenditure”.
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors, mostly the newly elected republicans who wish to paint their summaries, the opportunity to boast that they have “distant” such an offer.
The Budget Control Act, which took place in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of an amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supported the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some parliamentarians wish to limit the number of terms of office of members of Congress, and members of the House of Representatives José Serrano (democracy, New York) wish to lift the restriction of two terms for the President.
Congressman Jessie L. Jackson, Jr. (democracy, Illinois) proposed many amendments to guarantee, inter alia, the right to quality education and health.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, like another prohibiting flag burning.
Some legislators also want to grant the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states object to them.
As members of the Congress have tried to propose amendments, they are not moving faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments and in the 110th.
This rate is declining from the beginning of the 1990s, when Congress members, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed over 150 amendments every two years.
But they did no more success than they are now.
The last amendment, which was adopted - 27 was approved in 1992, but was actually introduced to the Congress in 1789.
"Bought but not defeated," says Giffords in his first television interview after the attempt.
Ten months after the armed man shot in her at a public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (democracy party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday night, baked a tune from the Broadway show, "The Sun Will Return tomorrow", and said that he wanted better than to return to Congress.
When I looked at 20/20, E.S. Newz with Diane Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty formulating proposals and needed help in coming.
The program showed her a difficult way of recovery from a bullet injury that severed her skull and hit her left side of her brain, passing from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly under the Bill on High Debt.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 wounded, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang, and called her recovery "laughing."
At Sawyer's question, how she feels, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, as astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the 20/20 temporary special issue, which was shown on the eve of the new book Gabby: The History of Courage and Hope.
The special service told of the restoration of Gifffords after the attack on 8 January.
In the video Kelly filmed in the first few weeks, she's on a hospital bed with a brown head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physical therapists teach her how to do simple things.
Kneel your head.
Put your lips out.
And then her first word is "What."
A few days later, Gifffords gave the second word, "too," a request to change the menu of breakfast.
The video shown by the ABC shows that music played a central role in the recovery of Gifffords: we see Congressman singing with the doctors "The girls simply want to have fun" Cindy Loper and "The Free Falling" Tom Patty.
In an interview with Soyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on proceedings, said that he would not remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband told me that he had read an article in the March 12 newspaper about the shooting, when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six that had been killed.
A suspect of an attacker, Gerd Lee Lafner, is detained in Missouri prison and subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"It's heavy, it's heavy, it's heavy."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm defeated."
'And I said, 'Gabby, you're not defeated,' said Kelly.
You're just beaten up.
And you'll get through it, you'll get better and come back stronger than ever.
The combat feels more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street holiday that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock slept on the bout of helplessness, frustration, and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and Marines lined up around it.
The audience in the tuxedo applauseed him on the stand.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Zalzman, who organized the spring collection.
The Senior Military Officer at the concert, who also had the then Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Amiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," an officer wrote in an electronic letter.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was a pity.
Quite contrary to the impressions, the difficult relations that have been established between the army and the often uneasily, sometimes admired, U.S. public.
The soldiers are rife with praises for their sacrifices.
But the praises have their value, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting like a pity for people in shape.
"We are not a victim at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who led troops to Iraq and soon left for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show some support is to treat us as unhappy."
This is a sensitive theme for warlords who do not want to look ungrateful or dissociated with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by the returning troops in recent years in the Vietnam War has been much worse.
As a result, most of the talk of pity takes place quietly and only between combat veterans.
After two of his sons returned from fighting in a maritime infantry, a retired Colonel, Mark Kenshing, warned them that the people of the army would look at them from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration, for they were instigated by the rebels and were in an exotic place.
Others will wonder if “under the massive cruel, evil veteran”, said Kenshing, who fought in Iraq and returned to take up a high government office in Washington.
While looking for work, he relates, he felt that some of the interviews were careful to ask if he could handle the pressure to do responsible work in Washington right after the war.
Kenshing remembers when he told his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative effects."
The awkwardness that the military experience may experience is due in part to the American indifference to wars.
Victorys on the battlefield are rarely commended by a country that has little knowledge of the army and has little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism in the way that was usually the case in World War II,” says Lieutenant General David Berno, who commanded United States troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public focuses mainly on the deep suffering of the soldier.
The combat is estimated by the number of moves they made by the number of comrades they lost or by the scale of their losses.
The army faces growing pressure from supporters to fight rape
This week, historical hearings should determine whether a lawsuit against the army will be passed against 28 men and women on charges of non-responsibility to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the following:
Elizabeth Leiman, aged 25 and 11 weeks of pregnancy, allegedly was raped at night by her fellow worker.
That was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend, and met a male fellow worker carrying 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could come into the room for a drink.
"It was red flashes," Lyman says.
But Texas's coupled with her fears.
I thought no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I hadn't obeyed my instinct then."
A few minutes after they went into Lyman's room, the man came to her behind, collapsed and raped, and she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former members of the armed forces will wait hard for the judgment of the court to be heard at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, and will decide whether they will go to court for a lawsuit against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumfeld.
The claim states that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to deal with widespread military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The case filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., initially included 17 plaintiffs, but increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claimed to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by their officials and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute or bring due justice to the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's been targeting the highest officials of the army, because the problem starts with them.
"The Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Burke also says that about 400 other victims have been contacted since February, many of whom can take part in future claims.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case, to put all the eggs in a single basket, so to speak, it will open up a lot of business if you need to keep pressure.
The defence team from the Ministry of Defence, led by the federal prosecutor, Neal McBride, took steps to stop the case.
The judicial documents that Newsweek received reveal a protection strategy - mainly that former or current soldiers cannot file military claims for damage suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision, Doktrina Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for damage caused by persons in military service.
“The damage claimed refers to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs”, states the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this history.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still legally prohibited from participating in the fight, this division is only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the fighting zone.
Result: 150 female soldiers died between the two wars, two thirds of them fighting.
It's time for the armies to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her trials, three others are prepared.
At the Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academys on the charge of promoting a women's hate atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a lawsuit against the army, at the centre of which is the diagnosis of “person-changes” that victims of violence face in order to prevent them from serving, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati of a human rights group, the Organization for the Action of Women Soldiers.
Her team filed a complaint in December against the Veterans' Office, accusing him of discriminatory treatment of pensions from people who claimed to be at risk of sexual violence during service.
Nine separate bills offering a number of measures have been submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, the Ministry ' s Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service reported 3,358 rape attempts.
But it is known that attacks are often not reported, and the Pentagon estimates that this figure represents approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 190,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, which was published in March, also examined the percentage of cases: 20 per cent of known cases were brought to trial in 2010, twice as much as in the civil justice system.
Students in the Burke case call them attacks only the first in other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she claimed to be raped by the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times the police, doctors and commanders.
She collected evidence of rape, and the attacker's blood, from a cut on her hand, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting before a judge and asked if she had had sex with her friend before the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive character to the accused, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read out," Lyman says.
"I thought I was born right now -- I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I left, I remember my commander saying, "It wasn't a trial for him, it was a trial for me."
Lyman was told to address a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change, which made her unfriendly.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with an adverse wording that prevented her from obtaining any benefits.
Whether Lyman and her associates put forward the case is a difficult question, says John Terley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
He notes, however, that “they are, in my opinion, capable of moving forward”.
There is a doctrine between them and the verdict that has been criticized since it came into existence.
I've spent my life critical of Doctrina Feres.
The army has fallen behind for decades because it has no incentives and deterrents that are responsible.
He adds, "It's very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when right-wing people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favour, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform”, she says.
Or until we die, what happens sooner.
Wall has eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Berging Braywick was a regular guy presenting his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Brayvik, who was known to have committed the massacre in Norway in July, which claimed the lives of 77 people, attended his first public hearing.
Although he could act alone, Brayvik was far from alone; he spent a long time preparing to attack his computer, dealing with millions of nationalists who supported right-wing groups in social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can you find them?
Easy, you just have to go to Facebook.
"We realized it was not easy to get close to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report on European cyber populism of the British DEMOS Research Centre.
The availability of personal data on Facebook is so great, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use a website advertisement tool to provide the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy, that marketing has been doing for several years.
Bartlett's team discovered half a million fans of right-wing groups throughout Europe and then raised their advertisements, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ad suggested that the user be interviewed about their level of education, violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants from 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries were able to interview, not even leaving the office.
'It's a completely new way of doing research,' says Bartlett.
Some of the results are less impressive: right-wing online, mostly male, unhappy with immigration.
But all of a sudden, "those who combine their online activity with off-line activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind the monitor."
The DEMOS work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new and popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, researchers and political scientists use the website to study everything from health to social trends in Leyak, posts on the wall, and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three records a day, Facebook 's `sub-actual information' has caused a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles called the site' by 800 per cent in its title over the past five years.
For some of the researchers, Facebook's beauty is that it provides an opportunity to study people that are impossible to approach on the street with a notepad.
"Raasche, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to join the party and they'd never have received you," Bartlett says.
"Fasbuck excludes all this, you address them directly."
Others say that this site could help identify and study social health problems.
Mégan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues, found that students who discussed their drinking exploits on Facebook were far more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent on this matter.
Moreno suggests that students, such as their hostels, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drunk status.
"You can't solve the problem without discovering it," said Washington Post Demetri Christikis, co-author of Moreno and the Director of the Centre for Child Health, Conduct and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We have found a way to identify children from a group of risk that we would not otherwise find."
Facebook also constantly extracts data about its users.
The site data processing team worked on Valentine's Day and Day statistics, the voter appearance in mid-2010, and the National Happiness Index (mostly using information that they had access to only them - cybersbod champions had long insisted that the site should make its vast collection of data available to the research community).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not, in exchange for the opportunity to play Skrabble with a friend who's thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become involved in a study that they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined standards for off-line research, online data is publicly available.
"I don't think many of the users even thought that the researcher could observe their profile," says Neil Selvin, a sociology at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about the study he had done in 2006 using the public pages of Facebook.
"As much as they imagined, it was only between them and their friends."
A question then arises as to the methodology.
Even offline doesn't have any guarantee that the subject matter of the study is very honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much information the profile and the user page are true.
"What you say on Facebook, and what you do outside Facebook, two different things," Selvin says.
That is why, despite years of work in the field of technological research, Selvin thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools available.
"Nothing can replace a real world with real people," he said.
"So far, social research is supposed to be about the social, and most of the social is still on the offline."
Anders Berging Braywick will be tried publicly for the first time
Anders Berging Braywick, a person who confessed to having a double attack, which claimed the lives of 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “opposer” fighter during the first public appearance in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and Knights of Tampliers of Norway”, he spoke to 500 in the courtroom.
“I object to the court because you've been given your mandate by organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the action, but I don't admit it."
Judge Torqueil Nesheim interrupted Brayvik during this monology because he "did not wish to give Brayvik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Brayvik, who brought with him a written speech in advance, to contact the victim ' s relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nehaim also ordered the police to detain Brayvik for another 12 weeks, denied him access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would strictly monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives of the victims visited the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Brayvik in the eyes, others to make sure he's locked up.
They all came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhumane," told the Norwegian NRK channel of one of the Utom survivors.
"It wasn't comfortable, but it was a little easier for me personally after I saw and heard the suspect."
The wearing of a dark suit and the blue tie of Brayvik maintained calm and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite Brayvik's strange idea that he was part of a large “opposing” movement, the judge found that he was not insane and said that there was no evidence that he had acted with accomplices.
Some people may be relieved that the 22 July attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist rather than a radical group.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that is now felt by the entire nation.
"I should like for him to look like a monster, but it isn't," said a relative of one victim.
"It would have been much easier if it had been so."
7 lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs, which shows at the theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing his technical genius as the Great Modern inventor.
But what Apple's fans can count as the biggest discovery in the newly discovered interview, which was remembered in advance of preliminary shows in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and he considered himself a hippie, but he was also an intimate organizer and modernist of the production process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from “the pain of thinking that a really big idea is 90 per cent of the work... but the great idea of a large product separates a great amount of skill from the work.”
On the way back to 1995, Bob Kringley set up Triumph's teleser on the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long discussion.
By that time, about 10 years had passed since Jobs was expelled from Apple, and he was working everywhere in his new NeXT computer company, awaiting massive Internet development.
While a small portion of the Kringley interview had been used in the Nerdus, he said that the original interviews had been lost during transportation.
Only after the death of Jobs was the full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This unreserved material, slightly edited, was the basis for a 68-minute film by Steve Jobs: a lost interview that comes out at Landmark Theaters on this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a person who is known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusually ready to express his technology philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different points during an interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers - thought for 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments where the perfectionism of Jobs comes out on the surface, where it seems to be infuriated with the questions of Kringla, prompting him to move more quickly to issues or events of greater importance.
In an interview with the Pixar era, the iPods, and the iPhones, there's something more ominous about what Jobs estimates what he sees different companies do right and wrong, and offers their own vision of the future of information technologies.
It's one thing to read about Jobs' post-mortem estimates, but there's something woundy and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, a disturbing dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should have been.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of seven significant findings of the interview lost:
How he learned how to run a business:
And the answers you always get are, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply about business.
That's what I learned.
Jobs continues to describe in detail its attempts to rationalize Apple reporting.
A structured way of recording costs, often starting with "standard costs" that came from the ceiling and then went up with an "occurrence", he created an automated structure that ensured that they could keep track of business spending down to smalls.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs detailed about the blue box that he anointed with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-range calls free of charge.
The device was written a lot earlier, but Jobs' euphoria here when describing the blue box as an act of giving authority to an infectious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a telephone automate, by talking to each other, and then by connecting from one network AT&T to another until as many stations were connected as possible.
"We've covered the globe half a dozen times, and you've been yelling in the car phone, and it's kind of after a minute into a neighbouring automate phone," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we got was that we could blow something up that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could put on a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without that, Apple would ever show up.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous weekend that he and Wozniak had practically done by calling across the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking Pope's phone, trying hard to copy Henry Kissinger.
When the various members of the Catholic hierarchy were called up in the middle of the night to speak to an American diplomat, the two had a laugh just before the pope had been raised to answer the phone.
About the love of technology (and the cold call of Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, he found Bill Hewlett in a phone directory and called him.
Soon after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett Park.
"This has had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I've ever seen at the age, and it has shaped my view of what a company is and how well they belong to their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP staff who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw the "first desktop computer".
He was about the size of a suitcase, he had a little monitor with an electrical beam, and I fell in love with him.
I often went to HP with a teenager and revolved around that car and wrote a program for her.
Concerning improvised innovation:
In a few places, Jobs' interviewes talk about inventing new products per summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of office bills, a buyer asked him to collect a complete computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think about his collection and deliver his finished equipment.
Later on, in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember a violent argument... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse worth $300], and I was sitting on my throat, and I went out, and I found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About big companies losing energy:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs had accurately predicted how many industry leaders would see situations and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerax, so you're doing the best copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [that is, those types of people] who eventually come to the management of the companies, and the people who make the product are expelled from the destination of the decision-making process.
The genius of the product that led to this monopoly is displaced by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could have been ten times bigger, could've been Microsoft in the '90s...
They were defeated.
On innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea of a large product separates a great deal of the art of work... when you have a big idea, it changes and it grows."
You'll learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises you need to go to -- some things you can't make you make electronics, glass, robots or factories.
You have to have 5,000 ideas in your head -- those concepts, all of them together...
It all comes down to taste -- everything comes down to trying to tell you what people have ever done, and then they try to bring it to what you're doing.
Picasso said the good artists are copied, the great artists are stealing.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
And part of what Macintosh did was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who had to become the world's best information technology specialists.
Had it not been for information technology, they would have done amazing things in other areas.
Skala and Thomas have lunches with opponents of the Health Law while the court is handling the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would be hearing a revoking of the law on health of President Obama, his two judges, Antonina Skala and Clarence Thomas, who would hold for lunch sponsored by a legal firm that would challenge the case before the Supreme Court.
This case took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions put before them.
One case on the agenda was supported by 26 states challenging the rapid review of health services adopted by Congress last year, a law that united conservative activists of the whole nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; indeed, a turning debate of 5 1/2 hours is expected in March 2012 and the outcome is likely to interfere with the presidential race, which will be at its peak by the time the judgement is pronounced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court to claim that the Health Act should be repealed, most likely by Paul Clement, who was the Deputy Attorney-General during George W. Bush's presidency.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped finance the annual lunch of the Society of Federalists, a long-standing group that has consistently upheld conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the Pflitzer Inc pharmaceutical giant, which has an enormous financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
There were, among others, Mitch McConnell, a Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the Health Act.
The honorary guests on the dinner?
Nothing new: Two judges have been in the company of federalists for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
Had they submitted, they might have fallen under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judges may attend the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, honorary guests or mentioned in the programme.”
Nevertheless, the apparent proximity of Skala and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, like a company with greater financial interests, was sufficient to send a message to ethics activists in the Government.
“It's a shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code contrary to the statements of some judges that the Court remains true to the same rules as apply to all other federal judges”, said Bob Edgar, President of the General Case.
“The parties drank and dinnerd on a formal fund-raising action with lawyers currently being tried in court.”
Their emergence and assistance in collecting money for this event undermines and is unacceptable.
Skalas and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with groups like the Federal Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, the conservatives argue that this is an ethical issue against Judge Helena Kagan, not Skala and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in Obama's administration when the first judicial objections to the law were raised at the level of the first intervention court.
Her critics demanded that Kagan give up the hearing in the case because she was too involved in defending the law in order to be impartial now.
Kagan never showed that she was going to do that.
Boeing gets a record 18 billion aircraft order
The Emyrates airline orders 50 boeing 777 wide-screen liners and maybe another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the transaction size is over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company gets orders for 50 items of its product.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. engineer, and the price of all these 50 fixed-wing aircraft is $18 billion.
So important is where Boeing got the order: The Middle East, the growing gold lived on future aircraft orders.
A Monday forecast estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 fixed-wing aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing has sponsored its largest dollar equivalent order of commercial aircraft this weekend, 50 Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy 20 more aircraft that will raise the total pre-prefabricated price of up to 26 billion dollars, as Boeing stated in Aviashaw Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, the Boeing reported, Man Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which could boast much better fuel savings and passenger comforts.
The pre-fabricant price for six fixed-wing aircraft would be over $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said analyst Morningstar Neal Dior.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Many Middle East airlines own oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but also the increase in the price of fuel, which is usually harmful to airlines because it is one of their largest objects of expenditure that is not so destructive because the country is making money at high oil prices.
It's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the airline order when prices go up, Dior said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emyrates orderings strengthens Boeing's leadership in the marketplace of large-scale aircraft and helps prevent the rival Airbus SAS from attempting to defeat his domination with his A-250 airliner.
The Boeing took place four months after Airbus announced that it would delay the debut of the largest A-250, which competed exactly from 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axis load after the buyers had demanded an increase in the capacity and length of the flight.
Boeing Co's shares grew by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico apparently lost in the Michokan elections
Louise Maria Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped Opponto Fausto Valleho of IUUU in an election race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister did not seem to have carried out her application for the place of Governor Michakan during the bitter state elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers had helped to induce a race in favour of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results of the Western Governor's race are known as Fausto Valleho of the Institutional Revolutionary Party or IUUU.
“The involvement of organized crime throughout the entire electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michael, but also for the whole country”, said Louise Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after the voting was Sunday.
"They intimidated our candidates, our officers in the election, they boasted about the ballot papers, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IUU.
IUU was run by Mexico for seven decades before it lost its presidency in 2000.
It prepares a return, and the victory in Michigan is an important step in this attempt.
ISR hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo, it seems, has only overshadowed the Calderón, who's been in charge of the ratings until the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the National Action Party, or PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Valejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate for the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DPF, now owned by the Governor ' s chair, was the third major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left in front of the presidential elections in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the State of Moreella, denied links with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michigan, drug cartels specialised in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines had long held sway.
This is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoakan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
The mayor of the PNP was killed one week before the election, when he appealed for Louise Maria Calderón, and several candidates left the local electoral race because of fear.
However, whatever the elections are, the victory will give the party momentum.
The man who was supposed to represent IDP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the lead of the next year."
ADB convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has pledged India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid the long-term recession that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the manager of the ADB office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing large economies must “do everything they can” to accelerate the restoration of the currency block by either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned BRIC countries that they were looking at Europe's difficulties “free,” and said that Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help to avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"We all care about this."
"That's why anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis, is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be uncertain.”
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italian loans have grown alarmingly and the Prime Ministers both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it may again lead the world economy to recession and has led to calls on the leading developing economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be carried out through IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation, such as the purchase of EU financial assistance bonds, provided tremendous strength to the funds for financial stability in Europe in the negotiations to the Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce of India, said that India would “make everything possible” to help the eurozone, as its own economy was now undergoing a decline in exports and reduced foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a prerequisite, because where we find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others argue that it is meaningless for developing economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own profound economic problems.
Achutos Varsny, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult from a political point of view to assist Europe for an Indian 1.2 billion people, of whom some 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go to holidays on the sea, and it won't be taken well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to contain Greek multiple and well-paid public sector workers in poorly organized, non-profit enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis threatened “significant direct consequences” throughout Asia.
ADB forecast 7.5 per cent of growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now facing “dangerous risks” due to a European threat.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to prepare “extraordinary plans” to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
The Pentagon's warning of potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panette, gained momentum on Monday at Congress, warning that expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and call for a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already being reduced by $450 billion in the coming decade, but now fears that additional reductions of 600 billion or more can be inevitable if Congress is unable to reach a cost agreement.
"The consequences of these cuts will be destructive to the Ministry," said Panette in a letter to the republican senator John McCaine, Arizona, and Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the Congress ' s inability to adopt a budget agreement and the so-called section of the Congress had led to a global decline of 23 per cent and the cessation of many new projects.
“This severe reduction, which has been done so thoughtlessly, will make most of our projects on shipbuilding and construction impossible, you cannot buy three quarters of the ship or the building, and will cause serious damage to other modernization attempts”, wrote the Panette to the senators.
“We will also have to lay off many of our civilian workers and, as the reduction will be made so quickly, we will almost have to lay off the civilian workers to achieve the goal.”
“These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and cause serious harm to the preparedness.”
The reductions eventually affected the military, said Panette.
“While military funding in the Foreign Emergency Operations is not directly affected by the sector, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious breakdown in the core budgets”, warned the Panette.
“Contract personnel will be reduced, resulting in the cancellation of contracts and the contract of oversight that supports troops”.
“Six personnel will be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to military vendors, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote the Panette 10 days ago asking for details of the possible consequences of the automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
“The consequences of the sector in the Ministry of Defence will be the rapid fall of the United States as a leading world military Power.”
"We stand firm against this draconian action," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday night, when they made public the Panette letter.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we should impose ourselves."
“The server is a threat to the national security of the United States and cannot be allowed to do so”.
Whether the Panette's letter or the latest warnings from senators to the budget compromise or the appeal to release the Pentagon from the reductions, we shall see later.
The Panette was completely devoid of possible reductions, although it had come to work in the Pentagon leadership after many years of budgetary review in Congress and the White House and was aware that it faced a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a grotesque picture of what could follow -- the troops with the shell, but without the nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless band."
"It was a wing without enough pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without trained soldiers capable of carrying out a mission," said Panette in his opening remarks in the Pentagon.
“It is a force that is suffering from an unstable military spirit, ill will and unable to fight potential enemies.”
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
The annex to its letters to McCaine and Graham Panette provided further details on how “the reduction of significant operational risks will slow the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously limit our ability to be first in deployment and in reaction worldwide; and lead to unacceptable risk in future military operations”.
And Panette said that some of the largest defence projects could face obstacles, including those that had already been tested, and some only in the early stages of planning.
The list includes a single F35 strike fighter, a planned new bomber, a new generation ' s ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Marine Infantry need to replace the Hammer.
The halting of further development and testing F35 can save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and face the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to catch lies
A quick look at the last headlines shows how serious, and how widespread, lies and lies are in daily life.
The presidential candidate for the Republicans, Herman Kane, is in the process of challenging the charges of sexual harassment against several women; each party is accused of lying to the other.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania was charged with false testimony because it was alleged that a retired football coach had raped boys.
Last week, Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France, was caught when President Barack Obama of the United States, said that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Falsehood destroys careers and shakes countries.
The New York Congressman and the Internet E-Equalist Anthony Weiner made himself a fool to deny his output, which was quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
A former presidential candidate, John Edwards, was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to cover extramarital relations.
And again, no one alive at that time would ever forget a media circus with President Bill Clinton lying about his sexual relations with Monica Lewinski during his second term of office.
History of fraud at school and college is a regular matter.
There have been instances where teachers have given their students answers to the tests in order to be able to evaluate their own performance well.
Teachers who must teach the contrary send messages that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In one day, studies show that you may lie 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie of salvation.
Another study revealed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of contact.
Identifying lies or lying is a must for every individual and professional competence.
Unlike the room game, which looks like, say, charades, where you have to say, "Fuck!", detection of lies is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific evidence collected in the last six decades at prestigious universities in comprehensive research projects, especially psychology and physiology.
One result of the study was that most of the old myth myths were solved.
The liars look in the eyes.
They don't always stop, stutter, red, or laugh.
It is not wise to conclude that liars are difficult to notice and are hard to expose.
An experienced liar can get to the truth by watching the structure of the allegations, the mortar, the question structure and the time characteristics.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in an extensive and ever-increasing segment of false knowledge, and it is clear that identifying lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and which helps to direct our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include rerupting, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
The good liars are well versed in the reading of others, making them feel uninvited, controlling their own emotions, and being intuitive about the way others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men are more lying about themselves, whereas women are more about others, usually in order to protect one's feelings that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than non-married (but the lies they say are most often lying around).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty, lying to you.
How do I know if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behaviour of your target.
It's called the definition of the state of the origin.
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing changes further.
Watch the posture, the laughter, the voting characteristics of your object.
You'd like to know if a person knocks on his feet all the time, then you won't make unjust accusations when you see him kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Then seek out groups of misleading notes and non-verbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flashes, not as evidence of deception.
Deceptionists can mark the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can set their feet towards the door, they can bend towards the exit, they can change their posture in some way, or they can show "encourage after an interview" -- this exaggerated relief and a change of posture when all the difficult questions are behind.
Investigators often falsify the signal of the end of the interrogation so that they can simply look at the relief after an interview.
So, listen to your object's talk.
Scott Peterson is known to have failed and used the past time to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her searching throughout the country.
And a brilliant person can also use distance in saying, "I haven't had sex with this woman, Miss Levinsky," or repeat the difficult question completely.
The most common notes-based indicators are barely catchable.
Someone can use the "professional language" when they answer the difficult question, "OK... honestly... how do I know... how much I know?"
This makes the answer more emotional than the actual answer, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means of detecting lies, but there is no way of getting the skill of deception detection.
These skills will increase the chances for everyone not to be a victim of skilled pearls in his or her professional and personal life.
The pipeline line plan needs to be revised following the threat from the US to postpone its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, calling out the anger of the trade unions, but calming the environmental defences, the company that is going to build the pipeline, claims that it will be willing to review the project to resume work on it.
Traskanada reported on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Hills area in Nebraska and was confident that the project would still receive approval.
The company delivered this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitolia.
Transkanada ' s official representative, Alex Pourbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually be approved by oil pipelines, although on a different route.
This is following the announcement by the Department of State last week that it will delay the decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Pescha Hills of Nebraski and the Aquifer Ogalala, the vast underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental assessment requested by the Department of State is likely to delay decision-making until 2013, after elections next year, although the authorities denied that the policy was involved.
Obama, in a written statement last week, referred to the decision as an appeal from the Department of State and expressed support for it.
The oil pipeline is 1,700 miles long from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It's supposed to transport 70,000 barrels a day from Alberta to oil refineries in Texas.
To do that, he has to cross six states.
He is hated by environmental advocates, but loved by trade unions, who hope for approximately 20,000 oil-related jobs.
But anti-plane lawmakers in Nebraski are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Pescholic hills and aquifer Ogalala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department's study on environmental impacts showed that the project would have only limited adverse environmental effects, but the source of the energy industry stated that the Department's auditor had commissioned a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One: Whether the Lobby hired by Traskanada, Paul Eliott, who was the adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, is a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another was the choice of a firm that had been hired to conduct an initial study that was not appropriate because it was linked to the Transkanada.
Patty LaBel was sued for allegedly causing a child to become scared
The New York family claims that Patty LaBel's disco-dream began to lobby their homes in Manhattan, scare their young daughter to such a degree that it was not worth much fear.
"Lady Marmalade", an executive's election, had scared Genevieve Monk's 18-month-old son so badly that she had to carry over the " Personal Designs, Sleep Disorders" and "The intense fear of strangers," says her family to the Manhatten Supreme Court.
This happened on November 10th, last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, the kindergarten teacher, Rosanne, and Genevieve were on their way to family travel.
While Kevin Monk was getting the car, Rosenán Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside's boulevard with their luggage, to Genevieve.
Rosanne Monk said she stopped at the door and let her daughter down for a minute.
"Someone came to my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
Label's angry with a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door," said Rosen Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She came into rage and began using cursing -- the word C and the word F -- on elevated tones ...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of a bottle at me.
She said that Genevieve had hysterics.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," she said to the baby's mother.
Label attacked the mother, who was still holding Geneva, and her escorts had to hold her back and push her into the waiting car, said Rosen Monk.
The little girl cried so hard that she tired, added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology, but they did not receive a reply.
Counsel and representatives of LaBel are not responding to the comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not reported, but family counsel, Sam Davis, said that he took up the case free of charge and that the family planned to contribute any money he received to the charity of the children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patty LaBel to take responsibility for his actions," said Davis.
"This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to kindergarten education, with a 18-month-old child in hand."
Climate problems have slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López, in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market grew, foreign finance declined and the economy was weakened.
2011 - which will mark the year of Sinaloa ' s economic history as the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdes, also called the year of change, which has given rise to high hopes for economic development but, given the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but there has been a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The lower temperatures of February not only have resulted in the loss of millions to the agricultural sector, but they have limited the potential for growth in the public economy, resulting in a decline of 3.6 per cent in total economic activity in the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, affecting the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on the areas affected by the Moroza provided by the Council of Mexico for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares suffered, of which 78.03 per cent were severely affected, and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected, with vegetables, maize and hut.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, an accelerated rate of unemployment was recorded during the first three quarters, from January to March 55,053 of Sinaloa residents were unemployed, up from the share of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, to 5.28 per cent in the second quarter, and from July to September it continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, the proportion of the population to over 74,000 of Sinaloa unemployed persons, an increase of 18.969 over the first half.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa over the course of the year has many factors, for economist Gerardo López Servantes, Director of the Department of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autonomy (USA), the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is associated with several factors, including a loss of liquidity in the market to limit the resources imposed by the law, which was adopted by Congress to combat money-laundering, because people who illegally own dollars are not easy to work with, invest and use in anything," he said.
Cessed immigration
López Cervantes said that there is a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
“The number of people leaving the state seeking employment abroad has been limited in the United States, primarily because of the difficulty of entry, and in the second, because they have once entered, they are already faced with a lot of job difficulties, so that a group of people are left and demanding jobs here in the state, as a result of rising unemployment,” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is getting worse when you consider the large number of violations that prevail in the labour environment, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the state ' s active population are working without being mentioned as employees in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and infractions, a further reminder of the state's employment is presented in low wages; the state has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was before September 5,352 peso, well below the national average of 7,375 peso.
FDI reduction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate, 2011 has recorded the largest outflow of foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July, the state FDI rate was $630,697. This represents a drop of 87.74 per cent compared to $514,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the State Government ' s Economic Development Minister recorded a total of 17,280,000 pesos investments during the year, mostly from services.
Debt
In view of the economic downturn, the state government asked for 3 billion pesos to be used during the state Congress in July to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no debt benefits were expected in any state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdes shows a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011, there was little agreement on the wishes of the various sectors, including the state Government itself.
“The efficiency of the Sinaloa economy was really low this year, has to work hard to restore the positions lost this year, we must redouble our efforts in 2012, we have failed to agree on the efforts of all and, above all, on the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope the next year will be much better”, he said.
Declining the economy
Lopes Loredo said that events such as the early freeze had stopped the state economy this year and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“The low levels of the economy were the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy, which is not fast enough to create economic dynamics, which makes it possible to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we are closing it below our expectations”, he said.
Revision of the direction
Theodoro Salazar Urarte, President of the Confederation of Employees of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state should continue its most dynamic productive activity.
"In general, we have found that we have been working on this, and we believe that there is a need to develop a long-term programme that will realign the direction and economic course of the state, to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coarmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better guide the efforts of the Government.
“generally, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, that there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own public policy manner.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is beginning to get involved in work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government realizes that a lot still needs to be done," he said.
He's being sentenced for eight kilograms of marijuana.
Five years' imprisonment and a 100-day income fine - a Navolato citizen was sentenced for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney-General indicated that the sentenced drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of a crime against health, in this case, possession of marijuana for the purpose of dissemination.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during the patrol of Cypruso Valdés before No. 80 in the town of Al-Qastillo, Nawato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck in which he carried a black bag in a car box and a small backpack in a passenger seat where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continues to be detained at the Crime Legal Consequences Support Centre.
Contributions should be made to the work
Public work in programmes such as Rodina, the rescue of public spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk remaining incomplete or delayed due to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes had so far been in danger, they were not in a position to make appropriate contributions, which amounted to an amount exceeding 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for the three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent was due, and that to date only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for work, and that there was still a possibility of delays in their completion.
"They have to put almost 12 million in, and although the year is over, they have not given us a penny when since the beginning of July they have to give us a piece," he said, "so that we can't put off, we've started our work and they're very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not make the contributions it had to pay, so that at the beginning of the period of the municipal administration, it had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that had not been made available in the case of the State administration.
“This happened to us in the previous administration, because the state has no financial opportunity to participate and the programmes have continued to develop and this year, in order to have access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what the state needs to remain”, he explained.
While the state authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that the interest due to them would come as soon as possible.
"They have to pay nearly 12 million, and even though the year ends, they have not given us a penny."
The Court will approve “digital television” in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals for digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (SW) rejected the constitutional claims put forward by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which transmits the so-called “digital television” from 2021 to 2015 as there were no eight votes required for its revocation.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers by issuing a decree detailing actions to move to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims submitted by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to speak on the constitutional or unconstitutionality of the decree and it remained in force.
The draft statement, prepared by the Minister of Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed that the decree should be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right enshrined by law under the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Coftel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margaret Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and to support the complaints, and Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to in it with regard to the introduction of a digital broadcasting.
At the Ministerial Meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the draft and also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive branch could not determine by general rules the measures to which the public administration should prepare itself.
“I also do not think that, if this were to happen, it would have affected the autonomy of the regulator” and recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas, such as telecommunications, was relevant to the federal executive, with a constitutional mandate, governance of the State.
The replacement of analog signals into digital, one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years, has resulted in better use of the radio and electrical spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would have delayed the benefits of conversion into digital form, which would include meeting the public needs, which have not only a technical dimension, “because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These questions, he said, “are the work of the whole system established under the principle of public economic governance, which includes a group of authorities that combine the Constitution into the State executive branch”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed their digital broadcasting and had done so with the help of the executive, despite the existence of specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, by adopting a decree under discussion which, in any case, affects the competence of Congress, ensures administrative compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
The possibility of counting “voice by voice” is being analysed in Michigan.
According to the PDP, the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the vote of 879 of the total number of 6.074 of the Protocols.
The possibility of counting the “voice by voice” for this year's election process in Michoakan where the differences between the first and second seats in the Governor's elections are only 27 per cent, even without counting the vote of 879 of the total number of 6.074 of the Protocols.
In the light of this, Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Saragos, President of the General Council of the Michelan Electoral Institute, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral corps adopted a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoakan did not adopt the State Constitution or Electoral Code or the Electoral Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal period for their entry into force in the electoral process, and the Governor of Leone did not include his publication within the time frame specified in the law in the Official Gazette of the State, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice decided on a constitutional claim made by the local Legislative Assembly and called the State's voice on constitutional reform “unreal and illegal” because it had no right to “resolve or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of a “voice for a vote” by Maria de los Angeles Lianderal, it was argued that, with the adoption of appropriate principles, it would be possible to present a partial or full count of the votes of the local electoral body.
For example, a partial recosting of one or more ballot boxes may be made on the condition that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no ballot and document count report in the urn or in which the President is not present; or where there are clear errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, the total counting of votes in all mornings of elections may occur when there is an indication that there is a difference between the supposed winner candidate for the elections and those who won the second seat less or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the party representative and/or coalition that has identified the second candidate.
The total counting will also take place if it is determined at the end of the normal calculation that the difference between the winner and the candidate in the second seat is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate took the second place, in the case of the removal of the ballot boxes, which were taken into account in the partial recosting.
It should be noted that this situation is marked by elections in Morélia, where, according to the PRL, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 per cent, without even considering 129 votes out of a total of 923 protocols.
His Final Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sapalinama Mountains, confirming his family.
The remains of the Felipe Basio Cortés pilot arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening, and an inspection and a peaceful Mass was conducted on Monday.
According to the family, the last bull of the Lieutenant Colonel was to be scattered through the mountains of Sapalinama.
Following the condolence with other people who had lost their lives in the disaster, the Basio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coauila aboard the Mexican Air Force aircraft, and the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the regiment’s ashes arrived at a time in the basement of Nasario Ortiz Garcia, where family and friends arrived.
At 5: 30 a.m., he was tested by the Santillo Institute of Technology, which was organized by his former high school classmates and football team, to which Felipe Basio was a member during his secondary school course.
"It was his wish to return to Saltillo, and to have his ashes scattered in the Sapalinama Mountains, he always said it to his family and friends," was what Sandra Cortés Basio, sister of the pilot.
In her view, the Colonel has fulfilled all his dreams, and she believes that he was at the peak of her life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a beloved brother loyal to his family."
Felipe Cortés Basio left the town of Saltillo very young to join the Aviation College in Sapopan, Khalisco.
Some did not believe him, they said that he had a head in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good person, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him as he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven, he went to Sapopan to the ceremony of his relative’s diplomas, so he knows that his uncle died, doing what he loved most in life: driving.
He's been driven in the last way.
Guns have been shot in the honor of the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortés Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, the village and government of the state, the Mexican Army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo High School of Technology, where he was studying in 1985 and was making progress, both in school and in sports, on his final journey.
Basio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was managing was damaged, along with the Secretary of the provincial Government, José Francisco Blake Morea, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05 the remains of Basio Cortés (conserved), Saltillo's resident, arrived to be transferred to the funeral office of members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martinez, to a training school mission where he was already awaiting his family, including his daughter Amandu and his wife, Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, his pupils and his teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned at NL Kadereyta farm
Some hours before detection, the military authorities had shown in the media 11 persons who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body with a control shot on an abandoned farm in the municipality of Kaderate Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The site was discovered 1.5 kilometres of the Kadereyt highway towards Santiago, on higher ground in a commune known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed by noticed that a village house with a wall painted in beige and brown had a door opened.
Looking inside, about three metres, they found the bodies of three people, and they immediately let the authorities know.
One of the men was wearing a black jeans yellow shirt, with no shoes, and another man was next to him in a white shirt.
Almost one meter contained the body of another, a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to the evidence collected there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no Giles there.
In the fence of a village house, there are signs addressed to one organized criminal group of another, and there are several bullet holes in it and in the gates.
11 Kaderets
The Ministry of National Security provided 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kadereyta and were accused of abductions, murders, frauds and hidden graves.
According to information published, eight persons were detained in the Los Alvero colony on 11 November, and one was rescued in hostages.
They were provided with three homes and a telephone, calling to become members of a criminal group called “Los Zetas”.
Another event occurred on 12 November at 0600 in the morning, when the military personnel made a patrol tour of the village of Old Rancho Rancho in Kadereita when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the cabin.
Having set them up and inspected, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later on, on 13 November, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was stopped in the public land of La Pravda, who, after seeing the military, tried to flee.
He is accused of secret graves in the municipalities of Heneral Teran, Hina and Kadereyta.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce a new Government that will face the crisis that has brought the country to the brink of an economic disaster.
The Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to introduce a new Government that will face the crisis that Italy faces on the verge of economic disaster and damage to the entire eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace said that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected that he will present a Cabinet, composed mainly of technocracy, although it is not clear when the new executive branch will take its positions.
Monty said that he would present the President with the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a Government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country’s ability to get out of this difficult period”, said the former European Commissioner to reporters.
Monty did not expressly say that he had been able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The school is now well marked," he said.
Monty has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less than normal, as Italy has dealt with the political and financial crisis that has brought their debt to a critical level
The administration, under the leadership of the former European Commissioner of Monty, must approve the hard-saving package required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy.
Based on pressure on Monti to speed up, volatile markets have set income from BTP Italian bonds to more than 7 per cent for 10 years, the level at which Greece and Ireland have to be saved.
Emma Marchelia, leader of the Italian Employers' Federation, told the reporters after meeting with Monty, "We said we'd be actively supporting this government."
We believe that it is the Government that is the last chance for Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome”, said the reporters Angelino Alphaano, Secretary of the Central Law Party.
The support of LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the Government’s majority of the technocrats that Monty is building up.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty should have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular hard-saving reforms.
Any blocking or halting of these attempts may result in a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association for Foreign Banks increased pressure to warn that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, alliances and business groups, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He'll finish his meeting on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, which allowed a very rapid transition to respond to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would retire, Italy ' s debt value has now reached a critical level, given the uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister will be successful.
Saving Italy, with a government debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for modern eurozone financial advocates.
Monty said that his Government would exist before the next elections, which had been appointed for 2013, despite popular forecasts that politicians would only give him time to carry out reforms before choosing new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his office, but major parties insist that he only has to be drawn up from technical experts, and that the process is affected by the financial situation.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and opposition by parties made it difficult to include political figures.
Spaniards have more play experience than Tikos did.
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, 10 have already played for 50 international matches.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 matches.
In contrast to Costa Rica, compare the 22 players caused by both countries on the match today at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San José.
While the champions of the world and Europe, the number one on the FIFA monthly rating, have a complete list of grade A selection games, Tricolor has only a lawyer, Michael Ouman, as the only person who has played 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at the Romel Fernández stadium.
Spanish football players, playing all the stars in the League and in the mighty clubs of the English Prime League, were very active during this year in the league and in local cup competitions, and they are high-level players in European teacups and the League of Champions.
To this we must add the experience of the Spanish Furia to a complex European or World Cup.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in the area of CONCACAF, which is considered to be the lowest in FIFA.
We can see that the list in the Spanish team of needles, Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (a 0-1 in London) was repeated by the record of Andrion Subizarres' ex-goulter, with 126 international matchrs.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and will set a new record at 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernández, Barcelona's player, 106 matches.
Casillas and Javi were recognized as the best UFA last week, along with another player of the Iberian team, the Subizarret, with 126 matchrs and Schalke Raul Gonzalez bomber with 102.
It's almost close to the 100th of Carles Poyol with 97 games.
Havi Alonso follows them from 91, Fernando Torres from 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both from 81, Andrés Injest from 62, Sister Fabregas from 61, and David Silva from 53.
By the side of Costa Rica, near Michael Umana, left side of Hunior Díaz with 48 matches, and Brian Ruiz bomber with 45.
Further, only five reached the 30th game: Ceylor Navas from 31st, Randall Asofeyf from 32nd, Michael Barrantes from 31st, Carlos Hernández from 36th and José Luis López from 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain are at Gérard Pike (37), Cerrio Boukets (36), Santiago Santi Cassola (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
In a collection of less than 30 exits in a field is Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26 matches, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Muri with 23.
The rest did not reach even 20.
Whereas Nacho Moréal has only four games, and Hordi Alba has two games, in Costa Rica, only one has been debuted by Victor Bolízar, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder.
Spain's leading player, David Villa, has a 50-density player, followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz became someone who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernández and three times as much as Roy Murey and Parks.
Quintett included the country in a 20-year career tour
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream.
In Viva's exclusive interview with Bascist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, the band was ready to give one of the best concerts the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There were more than 20 years of waiting, but the group said that it was also their dream that it was a reality to play in that country.
This was the approval of the bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview of Viwa from Brazil last week.
The Group is located on South America as part of a tour for 20 years of work and on Sunday, 20 days, it will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will speak at the National Stadium, beginning at 7:30 p.m., along with a team from Los Angeles The X and a local group of Las Roberts.
It's an extract from a conversation that has full decryption available online in The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, do you know what your fans are going to do?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream for us too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there is some devotion to a group; fans live in tension on the day before a concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that we took so much time to get here.
Some people, while waiting for your concert, treat it as the largest show of the year.
Does this add some tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We did some great shows in São Paulo, and we hope this led us to form a concert in Costa Rica.
We really do want to play here.
We love this country, we love to do serfing and jungle as regards these two things, Costa Rica, one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her waves for serfing?
We have a lot of friends in the series, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarido, and the waves are incredible here.
My friends are always going to surf in Costa Rica, and in Nicaragua, and in Mexico, these are great serfing places, and that's how we learned about this, from people who love serffing.
If you look at the tour, you can say you've made grand shows with a lot of songs.
What did you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We're trying to make the best show out of a variety of songs; we're going to play several songs each album, and present our fans with a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does it work?
I think it's partly because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs and everybody likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and that we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This tour is a 20-year career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe in everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine that we would be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for more than 20 years, making it look like a dream.
We rejoice in our good luck, and we are very encouraged by the fact that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
It's all very good for us.
What does it mean for you to be a part of the color of the boundary?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great groups.
We're good friends with Sondgarden guys, Mudhooney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and it's unusual.
From time to time, there is one group from the same city, but much more bizarre when five or ten groups appear at the same time in one city.
We are proud, and it is an honor, to be part of a group from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at the Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhooney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and for us to be part of Setel's sound that we got.
It's also very strange that the group like yours is still together in the same composition for a long time.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Kameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups do.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we're taking care of others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, music roads have also been opened that give everyone freedom of experiment.
We trust each other's music, and everything couldn't have been better.
Your attitude toward the word has been difficult; but thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you wish.
How do you find a balance sheet?
As we grew up, it became easier to find a balance sheet.
We take care not to be too long on tour because it is easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
When you remember people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what you've done without deciding to be famous and be a rock star, something none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Michael Low Baone?
I think we're writing really good songs and it was great at the beginning.
We've been a group for almost three years and we haven't released a single album, until Andy's death.
There was a lot of frustration because it's been this long, and most importantly, we've been close friends to Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Hilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or a photo, I think of Andy's incredible person, and as he made me laugh, it's always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football, and a lot of friends.
It was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local group, Las Roberts, will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
It's true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and so you chose her to open?
Yeah, the producers sent us some videos, and it was a group that liked us the most, so we can not wait to see that Las Roberts can offer the stuff, and it should be very exciting.
Why are you constantly changing the words at Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
That's the question to Ed (Eddy Wedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes into his mind.
Who influenced you like a bassist?
There are so many of them.
Among the first people to come to your mind are Gezer Butler, John Anthonyl, S.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovsky...
There are so many that I can talk about the bass that I love all day long.
How has Pearl Jam succeeded in maintaining the border, even though it's no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling a little bit of isolation from the word of the boundary.
When I think about him, he reminds me of groups that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoone, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone that came up at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoone are making music better now than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's become more positive.
How will you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are a few songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breath, which are thought to be very dark, although they may sound a little bit positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, those songs are very grim.
I think that when you're growing up, and in your life you've had some trauma and you've lost a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person, and yet you can make grim music.
Peru:
Fuchimori was again hospitalized for the medical examination
Ex-President Alberto Fuchimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the public hospital, for a muscle - loss survey, which is being carried out by his family doctor.
Fuchimori, 72 years old, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990), suffers from several diseases, including the cancer of the language, which has led to his operation four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Agina, who is his personal physician, told television channel N that Fuchimori would be examined within three days at the National Institute for Non-Polastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of force in its lower limbs.
Agaga said that in his view, Fuchimori should be a candidate for the benefit of a humanitarian pardon; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried four operations for the cancer of a language, lost a weight of 18 kilograms, added to other diseases, such as strong erosion gastritis, pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and legform problems, and listed the doctor.
Fuchimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the Police National Office of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for killing 25 men by the army destruction squad who acted in secret during his first years of government.
The mukhika is sent to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, headed by President José Mukhika of Uruguay and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will visit Mexico on this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political issues of the region.
It will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important point of an extensive plan of meetings with the political, commercial and community of Uruguayians living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan authorities.
The meeting of the two Presidents in the city of Guadahar will be “a welcome exchange of information on the political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership published on its website.
According to local media reports, Mukhica is seeking support from the Calderon for Uruguay in an incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included a South American country in a letter of tax Havana at a meeting of G20 in the French city of Keen.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remained tax harbours, a declaration that had led to Uruguay ' s protest and withdrawal from the Ambassador ' s consultations in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing an agreement with the South American country since January this year on the exchange of tax information in order to avoid double taxation, since November G20, a group of the most developed and developing countries.
The Government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to expedite the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements to leave the Organization's “serious list of economic cooperation and development” from countries that do not benefit from international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, the Free Trade Agreement (ITS) has been in force in Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has increased trade flows between the two countries.
"Super Mario 3D Land" will be three-dimensional.
Super Mario was constantly fighting for more than 25 years to save Princess Pic from the evil paws of Boser, but he never before did that in three dimensions: at Super Mario 3D Land, he'd fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
A publication that will be available in shops around the world this month has been created taking into account the characteristics of the 3DS portable console, which allows for three dimensions without the need to use eyeglasses.
"Mario is the hero who has to report on how the stereoscopy will work without eyeglasses," said Nintendo, head of the press service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land is "first video game of Nintendo, specially designed under this platform," because until now successful products like Star Fox 64 3D or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adapted to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo stated that despite the existence of 3D, Super Mario 3D Land was a "accessible" video game that allowed for fast and mobile games.
Alvarez said Super Mario 3D Land has two games in one: the first part's Simple to attract less experienced users.
One day, the majority of experts will go "second-round" to levels that are now more difficult.
In addition, users can choose from real time between "D" or "Daggressive", which only affects the depth of action, but has to be played in three dimensions in order to overcome the various obstacles and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the hero's return to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game Nintendo is waving the serial fans and repeating a successful formula from previous games, a plumber with must go through dangerously mined platforms to free the Pic princess.
However, the player will detect new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as Luigi's "player".
Colums guarantee the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process, Alfonso Portillo, had begun to respond in the United States to the 70 million dollars laundering plot.
This concludes the process in which Guatemala responded to a request from the northern country that required the issuance of Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision was linked to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, bearing in mind that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he did not “truth” legal decisions and accepted all extradition procedures he had ever known about.
Together with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marrocín, both for murder and serious bodily injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for the sale of drugs.
What Colombia has done is the executive process, after all legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted with a view to prosecuting the State's ex-heads from 2000 to 2004.
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (COP), Portillo will be extradited once with the decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and with the guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent at Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a prior to extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and recommenced the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of Trinijove’s first 25 years of social support organization are important: 6,000 young people who are socially excluded have helped to overcome the difficult situation during this quarter century.
More than a hundred jobs created for this social group should be added.
The anniversary was the occasion for the proceedings at the ceremony held at the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared next to Trinit Wella in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, job insecurity, drug problems or marginalization.
Last year, San Andreu was celebrated with a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that worked with the association during that 25-year period.
Different political representation during the elections showed the uniform nature of the work of Trinijove.
Following the President of the Generalate, Arthur Massa, and his predecessor, Khordi Pohol, the ceremony was attended by an ex-consultator of Socialist education, Ernest Maragal, and an ex-Lentant of the Mayor and the current eco-socialist, a member of the municipal council of Richard Goma.
Also present at Fabra I Coats was the current consultant on social welfare and family issues, José Lewis Clerice and the CoE on social work, La Caixa, House Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove appeared at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far “is a good base”.
The President cited Trinijove as an example of the fight against bad circumstances and of the hope of people in difficult circumstances.
"The crisis is not new to the organization and the work done to it," he said.
The seized building, where mass parties were organized, evacuated
Invaders occupied 11 of the 13-floor building on Balmez Street, 51
12 o'clock left the building yesterday at noon without fighting
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living in house 51 through Balmez street came to an end.
Twelve people left the building at noon voluntarily, which they illegally occupied, and where they organized mass parties, which irritated the neighbours, on a court order without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the doors was changed to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, it will be a passover," said the manager.
The squatters, which took 11 out of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of the village, took all the electricity and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially the banks under alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a mass party site that lasted for up to two days and irritated the owners.
Immediately behind the building is a night club, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantenat, reported to Europa Press that, since the building was occupied, its income had fallen by 80 per cent.
The owner of the club says that the occupants of the building dragged her into an unfair competition because they sold her three euros' drinks, whereas at the club for ten.
In addition, the discotheque owner was supposed to respond to the noise complaints of the neighbors, although she observed that the noise was not caused by the club visitors but by the squabblers and, above all, those who attended the parties that had organized, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, according to scattered neighbors.
The owner of the club said the discomforts were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now he has forgiven her rent.
The City Police have also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from their neighbours about the situation.
The President of the municipal group, Alberto Fernand Dias, demanded last week “immediately evacuating the building in order to resolve the problems of coexistence and the general spirit of the neighbours and the degradation in this area”.
A popular leader explained that only one floor had been occupied before summer, but in the last few months, squirters had invaded all the floors and almost every room and that some of them had been broken.
In that sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against the culture created in the building”.
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building to Noo Barris.
At 15: 30 p.m., the police went to Montral Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or Mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of post-Appointment arbitration
The 16 doors municipal competition resumed the debate about the role of Colserol in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the rise of the now dwindled Capital Corporation Barcelona (SSC), the Administration printed a letter for Kolserola.
The descriptive description of the mountain was that of Barcelona’s large park.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with New York Central Park.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987, the park again occupied the consciousness of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few, not of the north-south headings, but of the upwards (uphill) of the sea.
The positioning of Kolserola as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with the wild boar as the bear Yogi.
This was so far, in September, that the council did not declare an enormous competition of 16 different gates to the Kolserol.
The park's idea is clearly understood by the gate.
Whether or not, someone wants to set a gate on the field.
The question is, Colserol, Park or Mountain?
The contests and their organizational side and their impact on the city are a topic for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly a recurring topic, which is discussed when two members of this clan of elected people are identified in the elevator.
This fact leads to just one of the few coincidences between the three architects of Barcelona and the scholars who were present.
Miguel Roddan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coast line, the “necessary” to discuss the“ front side of the mountain” was not realized when the offer of the Ildephon Serda, the mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"It must be allowed that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
And it's also very accessible.
He says that the title “Colserol's Gate” contains“the word trap: we don't have to think of them as “the entrance to the park, but as the limitation of certain areas where we should act”.
Modoldo, as Roddan and Bayon, with their urban experience, referred to the proposal as “an intellectual task” with “some hazards”.
Risks arising from “an uncertainty of forecasting public space” following the 80x experience that ended at the Forum's “his swan song”.
The first fear is limiting the boundaries where you can build.
"The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step," that is, the transition.
“We have to think about new urban planning tools, because current [as regards the capital master plan (GSP)] can lead to a real disaster.”
Closer to the case, Modoldo believes that simplifying the Colserola Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, rather than" as a purely topographic question.
Modoldo recalls that there is already work done outside Calserol that “don't miss the ear of our ears”, although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers to his profession to join the project “from the very beginning”.
And more than that, we understand that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but “he is in doubt” about whether this technical profile is a matter of being led by multidisciplinary teams (“the success”), he claims, which was to create: “The architects must be only a tool”.
Byion suggests that the answer to the question posed by the name of this part is complicated, because the competition rules lack the overall type of Collserola: "The 16 cross-crossing competitions were announced," he says, "in the sense of the sea-mount, but there is no longitudinal reading here to see and understand an area as a whole."
This makes 16 competitions take place, at least in his case.
On the other hand, a project for some gates may overlap by programme and definition with a draft architect for neighbouring gates.
In your view, the advice is to ensure that the lane is directly above Rhonda de Doalt to ensure in its entirety an area designed to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasaball and he will be released
After 72 days of judicial decision, Red Casino pardoned the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasaball will be free after the legal representative of Red Casino granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal Court, which is conducting the extortion proceedings against the Mayor of Monterrey.
Following the Kasino Royale bomb, Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution to allow the Monterrey authorities to permit a secret operation in an playing house.
Following a public conviction, the Public Prosecutor-General opened a criminal case against the brother of the mayor and, on 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Crimes of Inheritance, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the capital of the State.
He stayed there for 49 days, following the provisions of the second order prohibiting displacement after the prosecutor had ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kadereyta for allegedly half a million peso extortion from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with an average prisoner isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue to serve in the municipal prison in San Nicholas, Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Janez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, there was sufficient evidence of the guilt of Jonas, such as the collection of 1.5 million peso from bookmakers in exchange for permission.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesiná to seek pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could have freedom in the following days.
At the time of the trial, the public prosecutor in court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if he had paid damages and who of the partners of the play house granted pardon, although counsel had tried not to speak the name.
Based on records 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and there was no application for the trial that had been planned against him; nor would no compensation be required.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of bookmakers, at almost 15:50, Larrazabal Breton was ordered to release immediately.
The court officer, Jorge Janes, went to prison of the municipality of San Nicholas in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
The Minister of Dionysio Perez Hakomé describes the details of the disaster, where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Minister of Communications and Transport (MTS) reported that the results of the accident, in which Francisco Blake More, Minister of the Interior, and seven others died, showed that the helicopter had been hit directly on the ground in full integrity without an attempt to pilot an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hakomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft rose up the pilot had discovered that the weather was suitable for flight.
"Elements which seem to show that the ship had several contacts with the land, the wings made contact with the trees at 25 meters, where the machine lost the flirtage."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the necessary requirements for the movement of persons.
He also said that the studies carried out in the area of impact did not report the existence of parts on the ground.
“The study reports that there are no components of the vessel elsewhere, that the impact has taken place in a structural integrity.
“Verlet was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for the carriage of passengers.
The earth at this location has a range of between seven and 30 degrees.
At this point, said the Secretary, the most important thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study can take months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Guilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeroports and Support Services, said that during the attack, the presidential helicopter was operated at a cruise speed and that it was on a mildly rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of the usual flight manoeuvre at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of SCT, Pérez Hacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the aviation rules, the flight was carried out under the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must be visible during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM records found suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft headed towards the border area between the city of Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where layers of clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to cloud conditions, the team was looking for a lower area and a more apparent area in the valley of Quernawak.
Place of strike.
The impact coordinates and the last recording with the radar of an aircraft may have coincided with the impact with no loss of control or change of direction.
The extent to which the debris is spread over a small area:
Information available so far indicates that the impact has come on the front and the side line.
The fragmentation of the debris makes it clear that the helicopter has encountered land under structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
There remains some evidence in the area of disaster in the wreckage of a vessel, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies have shown that multiple contact with land could be possible.
During their sit-in work, pieces of aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, with land ranging from 7 degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough study, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found in more territory than a marked area near the site where the disaster occurred, which reinforces the assumption that the impact had occurred in structural integrity.
MSS announces a program to find an obesity gene
Social protection is being led by a study of the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSI) has announced that it is carrying out a study to detect the obesity gene among children and young people, which has been referred to as the protocol “Getics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence”, which will provide evidence of excessive weight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit on Biochemistry of the National Medical Centre of the Twenty-first Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, diethologists and social workers had been gathered.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Police Institute (NPI).
The study invites the population (written or not) to participate by going to the MSSI sports centres, which participate in the study, in the Mexico Valley, where the children will be tested from 8 a.m. to 8 a.m. each Saturday.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be run at the Kuautémoke sports centre in the west of Mexico City, and since 8 October, events had taken place at the Nonsaualkootle Sports Centre in the east of Mexico City.
Once the goal of involving 500 to 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Centre (South Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (nor Mehiko).
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the underlying and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors among children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
On 14 November, the world day against diabetes will be celebrated, and the main goal will be to gather 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with parental permission and supervision to fill out individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or renal deficiency.
He explained that on Saturday all participants would have anthropometric measurements (vex, growth and mistaking), blood pressure and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genes related to child obesity).
Cruz López said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies from 1999 to 2006 indicate that there has been an increase in 6 years: in the case of boys, 77 per cent have been obese, in the case of girls 47 per cent; in the case of underweight, there has also been a substantial increase in this area,” said an MSSI specialist.
He said that the rationale for searching for markers was that the population was different from other peoples in their genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans were 65 per cent of the descendants of American Indians, 30 per cent of the descendants of Europeans and five per cent of the descendants of Africans, and this condition affected the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, basically, the genetic effects of obesity are the body's inability to burn surplus energy that we consume (caloria) and it is postponed in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the existence of dark folds on the necks and on the shoulders meant a possibility of breaking the metabolic and even predestinal.
Information is communicated confidentially, and doctors transmit it in writing to parents, who explain all the measurements and changes in lifestyles that must be taken to avoid disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main reasons for excessive weight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyles, or lack of daily physical activity, most of the day in front of television, and the use of small-range transport instead of walking.
It is also due to high consumption of calories, i.e. increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (sumal, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high levels of fat and protein and genetic predisposition, as analysed in this programme.
UNAM Asphalt can avoid cracking
Rafael Herrera, a chemical researcher at UNAM, has developed a polymer-midified bitumen to produce a mixture of best quality that is resistant to environmental and temperature.
If the signals sent by road cover were to be given attention, it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the Dolina Mexico City area, says Rafael Herrera Naher, a technical study of UNAM, and adds that if the process of construction and maintenance of asphalted road surface is regulated, the number of pits can be reduced or even reduced to zero.
In his lecture, the International Year of Chemistry Technical View reports that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops polymer-midified bat to produce a mixture of close-to-betum characteristics, but with a better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Naher said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather was extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of the roads and thus to counteract the formation of the pit.
He explained that bitum, the heavyest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, one is a high molecular mass called asphaltone, and the other is a low molecular mass called lads, which combine to give the road surface its characteristic viscosity.
Bitoma's visceral behavior is that at high pace about 180 degrees, he behaves like liquid, at 120 degrees high, and at 50 degrees Celsius, he remains almost stable, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, said he.
This means that resistance to street asphalt is not permanent, but changes over the course of the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, has been said by a chemical engineering specialist.
The chemical scientist noted that the streets of Mexico City were mostly covered with flexible coatings made from six layers of material, of which the last three include bitumen.
Among the highest layers is a bitumen, made of small stones, cast in bitumen, and then squeezed.
Every stone making this surface, he said, was loaded with bitumen.
When vehicles move and exert themselves, this helps the forces to be very well distributed on the road surface.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, said a chemical engineer.
On the asphalt sheet, he added, is a last layer called the wearer layer, made of fine stone, which is actually sand in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will communicate with the wheels of transport, it must have more resistance than asphalt coatings and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and disseminate these efforts, the wear-out layer also requires proper thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
The weather, especially the humidity and temperature drop, were also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it had a significant impact on the condition of asphalt.
When the land is raw, the water enters the surface and it's hard to get out of there, it's causing all the layers of the surface to be softened and thus the pit's forming.
In creating the pit, he said that it was the first to be worn out and only then to affect the bitumen, but no injury occurred instantly, a process that should be taken into account in the first indications of the ongoing maintenance programmes.
Also, a member of the National Research System explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of the hole, and therefore the thickness of each surface layer must always be linked to the load and this requirement must be guaranteed to prevent the frequency of the hole.
Rafael Herrera said that there was still much to be learned and done about bitumen, for example, by bitumenic emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help to make pits with ease and without high temperatures.
Why didn't the candidate from Valle take it to become a new Miss Columbia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Cerna Melina Ramírez from obtaining the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Valle was given the title of the princess at 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Kauk only wants to win Ms. Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Cerna was to be satisfied with the pod of the winners with a silver crown and tape proclaiming her new princess of Colombia.
In view of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where the Department of Atlantic won the crown and Sceptra, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the Legion of Women from Valle del Kauca, who were close to the crown, but were declared princesses, among them Mérías Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borgero Domínguez (1949), Patricia Belina Aalas (1979), Laurente Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alarades (1983), Olga Maria Arenades (1987), Lélas Blanques (1988), Monica Ewerves (1989), Maria Sonsuel Pinedo (1990), Dian Ichabel Romero (1993), Hisse Alhere Harre Harsevez (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stérès Alhouree (2008).
The question that many people are now asking is:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favourant, who in each of the presentations has shown that she has everything to become a new Miss Colombia, not just so she was elected by the Queen of the Police and the most beautiful face in version of the Vogue - the titles held by the Queen, for example Tatian Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor in the jury's decision to award her the title of the First Princess was that she was not able to answer the question, “What book identifies you and why?” asked Martin Murilla Gómez of literary society.
She answered:
I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of education, and I certainly believe that the book that characterizes my childhood -- Little Prince -- is a pretty deep book.
Today, I read "Prime and Punishment," which is a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; also at this moment, I am reading the book of Irina Nemsky, Russian writer, a wonderful book called the Jade of Blood.
A reply that the jury did not like because of the term “culture” and, secondly, because he did not specifically explain how each of the books quoted characterized it.
But after Melina's ceremony, she said she was calm and happy with her result, "Smart wisdom, what's going on is what's going on."
And all of you, please read a little, Little Prince is a big book.
Among the pronounced hypotheses was Valle burned to death by favouritism.
A reporter from Bogota suggested that because she was preferred, she was met with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster's cooking competition, the spectator vote for the best national suit, and Queen Matt), "that which instigated the jealousy of other candidates, caused the queen's stress, and she did not gloss on the stage."
This was noted during her first appearance in the bathing room on the beach of Hilton and during her two shows at the crown of the evening.
Although she was confident in both, it was evident that she lacked the strength and energy that the representatives Magdalena and Atlanco had shown.
"Aryel Osorio, a journalist for Kaka Home" in RCN, said that the fact that Milan was named a princess, "that means that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition doesn't become queen."
Moreover, Valle’s representative had recently avoided the press, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed in her attempt to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the Kraut National Convention.
That is why two days before the international jury was elected, Lucy Doty said that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must look not only at the appearance, but also focus on the consciousness of the public before they take part in the competition, they must already be involved in the projects," she said.
The representative of Valle also assumed that she had been exposed to defects in berries and fibrosis that had been found on her belly, but that was controversial, since the jury had emphasized her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The consultant, Queen Jorge Hernán Orosco, notes that Melina had no better body than he had, "but the problems of fibrosis on her belly that were not very visible to me have caused her to lose glasses on the last day."
Among other things, journalist Gvido Ojoos of the magazine, Cromos, believed that the representative of Valle de Kauca had made a mistake because she had been subjected to surgical intervention.
"Operations are good, but representative Valle doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize presented for the first time by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the cruel prediction came true last night, and it was a man given by Raimundo to Melina as a compensation for her lack of pleasure in obtaining the crown.
So, or not, the fact that Melina is now in office, not as a queen, but as a princess, is the position that enables her to represent Colombia at an international competition referred directly to by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will come into history as one of the queens, who, despite her outstanding performance at the Cartagena competition, have faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the job of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A Cali criminal came into history as a man confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officers is key.
On 4 November, CTI CTI Kali entered history as a person who confirmed the identity of the head of FARC Alfonso Cano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI criminists, this week, Elizara González, a man from Puerto Tehad, who had spent 21 years in the judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Chocho, where he often had to travel more than five days through the jungle to reach the places where the bodies needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and, after completing the relevant courses, he became a specialist in forensics, where he studied skin friction, that is, palms and shorts.
The week of Elysar’s operation to identify the person known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to wear clothes for no more than three days.
Something great has come near.
He arrived at a helicopter from Kauca in Palmira on Friday night.
He knew he would need to identify two corpses, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world’s oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Sains (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the place where the body was located, he did not identify him by appearance; he was very different from the one shown in the media.
He was a beardless, dressed as a local farmer, with no glasses and much worse.
But prints don't lie.
Using a large glass, ink, a shovel, and a flashlight, Elisar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the pictures.
His eyes didn't let him down. It was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad was asked to confirm to Juan Carlos Pinson, Minister of Defence, that he was the leader of the FARC.
Search for fingerprints
The recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar González at the Press Conference on the Operation against Cano by the Sijin Kali branch of the Cali branch is particularly significant.
Many people don't know our job.
Dactyoscopy is a hard science, without errors, and can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, the dactolyscopis take part in the investigation of offences such as theft and murder and identify the detainees.
In the course of detention, many criminals have false IDs or have no documents.
We take their fingerprints and find them in the base.
The researcher said that he had to take away a piece of the wall of the house in case of theft, because at this point the thief was using his hands to own a safe, full of preciousness and money.
"The walls are hard to work because they're not convenient surfaces to take prints out, but in that case we can take a picture of the whole palm and identify the criminal who's been involved in several thefts," he states.
Prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man with bottles from under the cobbler around him had recently been found.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that a relative might have been suspected of having committed a crime and that, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the murder scene.
According to a CTI expert, a chemical or physical reagent is placed in the place where the fingerprints are available.
When they show up, a stick or tape is used to remove them.
Print images are then sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or placed on the register.
"The problem is we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television programme.
Just as not everything that shines is not all that you touch leaves a print on you.
However, where possible, comparison is done.
“Enhanced people” challenge the New York authorities
Hundreds of protestors were bombed in front of the Zuccotti Square.
A number of the protestors heard the court ' s decision to clear the demonstration from the square and went to the park next door.
The members of the Wall Street Retract movement left on Tuesday a challenge to the New York authorities, when they tried again, under the protection of a court order, to Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn when they tried to capture another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protestors dug into the Zukotti Square, where they wanted to get by means of a court order that allowed the angry people to break the camp in the area while the other part of the movement responded to the race, captured the park in the north of the city, where further arrests took place
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't let us break the camp on the square, we'll break the camp somewhere else, and we'll continue the judicial struggle to return to Zukoti and through peaceful sitting strikes and demonstrations," Mark Bray said to one of the members of the Wall Street Movement.
Bray explained that the response of the “warned people” to the evacuation of the tenthouse, ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, had come to the court, where Judge Lucy Billings had issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the area and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the “warned people” began taking over a new park located at the Canal Street merger and Sixth Avenue, close to the Dutch tunnel linking New York and New Jersey, and the church’s coming into control.
At least an hour, they could have occupied this place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protestors, although Bree could not name the exact number, but telling Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that several hundred people were standing with the tents at the point where a delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support for members of the movement in an attempt to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the private area of Zukotti remains closed pending the trial scheduled for that Tuesday, which will consider the legality of today ' s protestant race.
Some of the protestors who went there carried and distributed, at the same time, copies of the judgement and even gave these copies to the police security personnel, resulting in “a small clash” said Bray, who said that some police officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Wall Street Movement and from forcing them to comply with “laws issued after the seizure, or to prohibit demonstrators from returning to the park with stores and other property used earlier”.
Mayor Bloomberg told the reporters that, as a result of this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators had been informed of it, but local laws prevented them from opening the tent stores and sleeping bags again.
The municipal councillor personally justified the removal of the protestors from the Zukotti Square at dawn, the operation at which about 200 arrests were carried out, and the decision was taken because the protestors “failed the law”.
Bloomberg said that he had given orders to clean up the square, because it became “the place where people came from not to protest but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm other people” because “some businesses have been threatened” and neighbors feared “for the deterioration of the quality of life”.
The evacuation this morning was repugnant and shows that, deep down in Bloomberg's heart, there is a greater interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers, added a representative of a movement who condemns the mayor for “hate of freedom of speech”.
Those responsible for the Wall Street Protection also indicated that they intended to organize “border actions” on Thursday, in cooperation with civil society organizations and trade unions, in order to recall the last two months of the protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Bubley and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on December 1 in a television program entitled Russell Peters.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen's "More Renovation", a rescue worker at Malibu Rescues, Banny in Playboe, a musical rockman named Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private CTV television channel announced today that Anderson, together with the coroner (Bublet Executive) Michael Bubley and other prominent Canadians, will appear in Russell Peters' Christmas on December 1 as a very special Mary.
CTV presented today a television show where Anderson, also known for her widely distributed home pornography video on the Internet, is playing with her husband, a band drummer called "Mötley Crüe" Tommy Lee, is wearing a dress like Deva Maria, holding Jesus in Jesus' egghouses.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian comedian, recently acting as leader of the "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Shin, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian singer, CTV, who married in Buenos Aires in the Argentine model of Lusian Lopilato, is also familiar with scandals, is participating in the special Christmas show CTV.
Recently, Buble called American Kim Kardashian "ducky" during one of his New York concerts
Japan, born after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and put an end to the fall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still going from a devastating earthquake, resulting in a nuclear crisis, a terrible catastrophe caused by the country's rising sun since World War II.
According to first estimates by the Tokyo Government, the material losses were $300,000 million, a blow that seems to be taking place despite the world situation.
After three consecutive blocks, gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped to convert the page: GDP grew by 1.5 per cent from the previous quarter to 6 per cent per year.
Registered in the second quarter, the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012 - it also represents the fastest growing rate from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be attributed in part to the resurgence of the purchase of machine equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami that followed.
Indeed, companies have increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against the decline of 0.9 per cent in capital costs from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real turning point in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Kensian momentum, which calls for the use of a crisis to strengthen or restructure infrastructure by using the gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has been awakened, mainly through the development of household consumption, which now amounts to 60 per cent of Japan ' s GDP.
This has increased by 1 per cent by an increase in the cost of motor vehicles, travel and rest.
Glemo yen
Tokyo provided a domestic market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the “currency banks” chosen by investors who want to rid themselves of the euro area's debt crisis and negative US forecasts, a privilege that puts a stone on the account of exporting companies.
In a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a major blow to a country whose economic course is defined by the health of large-scale technology companies.
Toyota or Sonia, for example, blame the yen for its low performance from July to September.
As long as the markets continue to defray the EU ' s outlying countries, the Government of Eshiko Noda does not reduce vigilance.
We must be concerned about the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the sharp rise in the values of the yen, said yesterday Motohis Furukawa, Minister of Economic Policy.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had demonstrated clear signs in September of a fall in economic activity.
The indicator, which predicts a break in the world economy, showed that the major forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, compared with 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone has even fallen below the average of 100 points after it reached eight tenths to 99.13 points.
The Athenss Regain to Sufficient
Papatomy said that the adjustment would be approved but that the conservators would not sign any written commitment.
Greece continues to wander through a maze, which leads to a way out of a major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “counsel” of the new Transitional Government of Elli is rather imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a true political belief is beginning to confirm the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Paúdimas yesterday warned that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the period agreed upon at his appointment might not be sufficient for them, the leader of the conservative “New Democracy” party, Antonis Samaras, said that he would not support the new strict economy in any case and reiterated his demand for the new elections, which were scheduled for 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to follow up on the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, and told Papapimos yesterday by opening up parliamentary debates that will culminate tomorrow with the confidence of the new executive branch.
A package of 24 programmes to increase the employment of the population, reform of the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures against tax avoidance will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras' message does not clarify his position: “We are prepared to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing”.
The Chief of Conservatives had taken one step more step in his moods concerning the EU and IMF, the organizations that had to freeze the 8,000 million urgently needed by Athens, and had explained that he would not approve any letter of consent to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still in a state of anger because of the effect of the Paandrea referendum's allegations, reiterated yesterday that its demands were clear: it would not renew aid if the new Government and the leaders of the major Greek parties did not sign “a written agreement without any ambiguities and as soon as possible”.
The representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafai, said that the troika inspectors could return “very soon” to Athens to discuss with the new Government, “which should be done to pay the sixth tranche of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been marked.
There's enough threads in the Greek greek for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: “These are tools of progress and hope”
The Queen stressed Spain's “core” place with regard to this type of finance.
Spain “has taken a prominent place in the world in the area of microfinance”.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor in terms of cooperation instruments, whose “importantness”, she said, was that it was “a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind based on belief in humans”.
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “reservedly necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and, in particular, to halve the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which is “poor”.
Spain “is still working” to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on this task with “responsibility”, says to her daughter Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements that will continue to be made during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “to ensure the creation of new capacities and the best opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women, the principal beneficiaries of these loans”.
There are “many achievements” and“the many difficulties we are facing”.
The Microcredit Summit is not only a space for disputes, but also a platform that promotes “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and that one hundred million of those households would be taken out of the poverty into which they had been immersed.
The message of the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world “went on a path that began a year ago” by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Ms. Sofia as “a test of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this tool as a "extreme idealist in the global effort to combat poverty" whose work is known for 15 years, since the queen went to Bangladesh to study its lending policy on the ground.
This experience took place one year later at the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as what was held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “everywhere I saw continuous development”, said Her Majesty, whose relationship with the project brought her yesterday the title of the title of the head of the family, collected in Valladolid, “the banker of the poor”.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her statement by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
“The ethical imperative”
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Trinidad, Jiménez, said that solidarity is “the ethical imperative” for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, since it was a “permanent obligation”.
Jiménez concluded that microcredit involves a “serious and firm course aimed at eradicating poverty” and that now “more than ever” Governments in developed countries must work according to the criteria of solidarity and prevent it from falling into a low-cost situation.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, commended the “success” of giving “convincings” to people who had been “disgusted against whom all doors were closed”, while Mayor Valladolid Francisco Javier de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city who “opened their doors in a spirit of solidarity”.
CPD proposes the election of the Presidency of the European Commission by a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDF) on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig was without significant difficulty for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it came about in the fall itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is far less stringent than it should be today with respect to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with respect to Italy....
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, which had been put forward by the management, was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The stands continued for a few minutes, which deserved to be heard by Angel Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schöble, Europhilus and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct response to the crisis is “not less than Europe but more than Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
"It's time for the Chancellor to break through in Europe."
This could mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty, which would make it possible for the European Union to exercise greater control over the financial policy of the countries of the Eurozone, but could also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote “to give Europe a person”.
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, which is apparently the idea of Wolfgang Schöble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree with this decision; Britain opposes that, and CDF leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy also opposes it.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the voice of each European Union member country in the European Central Bank government according to the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the German economy.
Wishing to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor increased the references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kola, but she did not seek to influence the Congress by means of “small” European countries or countries in distress, which would like to criticize Germany's “highest” position.
Although the draft resolution on Europe highlighted the importance of the German-French friendship, Angel Merkel did not mention France.
It's only a passing moment.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating injuries of the Napoléon army.
What is hospital fraud?
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the Government began to attack hospital beds.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the family benefit fund and address the issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on combating social benefit fraud.
And to help this out of the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also as part of a right-wing campaign to re-election presidents, the majority want to concentrate on hospital letters.
In view of the budget savings, the Government intends to impose on private company employees the fourth day of unpaid leave before the payment of benefits.
Obviously, without the specific consent of the employer who is a sick person, he loses his salary for four days at a minimum of 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
The measure that threatens to give rise to the storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echo, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other more symbolic measures, namely, imposing one day on public servants without payment of sickness benefits (public employees have not yet had to wait for benefits, as opposed to three days ' wait for private sector employees).
As these issues are being discussed, the majority have also raised the issue of fraud once again, with abuse in the issuance of hospital sheets.
The check will be tighter and more in addition, if you're caught, you'll have to pay back all the illegal payments you've received," warned Xavier Bertrand on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the application has been somewhat disproportionate to actual abuse of hospital sheets.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subject to constant control and political attacks, which bear fruit.
People in France are pain no more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's first look at the numbers from country to country.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economics, the daily compensation expenditure in 2008 of Euro113,000 was 5% of the total expenditure on health.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were maternity leave and work-related accidents, and 54 per cent were sickness benefits, representing €62 million.
Consequently, it was 2.5 per cent of health-related expenditure.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in the hospital in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Almaty Group study.
The arithmetic mean, which conceals some of the deviations; another study published in 2007 by the Sonster.com career management site, revealed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken a single day to hospital.
Another study, this time, concerning health insurance, states that in 2010 37 per cent of the hospital lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to 1 month, 15 per cent from 1 to 3 months and 11 per cent longer.
When these figures are compared with those of European neighbours, it is clear that French workers are no longer more likely to take a sick man than those of any other country.
A long-term study carried out in 2010 by two CRS researchers revealed that between 1994 and 2001 the total percentage of absenteeism in France (health or no) varied between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital beds is very low compared with the “series” of employment.
As for the level of fraud, it was very low.
The enforcement of the law since 2002 has led to a systematic examination of patients for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million cases verified by CNAM, 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term illness certificates were “unrealized” or too long, or 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital sheets for more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “unusable or unfounded”, or 132,000.
In general, 169,000 cases are found to have been “unjustifiable” for several million hospital workers.
Figures that show very few cases compared with, for example, the “series” of employment.
According to UMP, Dominique Tiana, author of the report in June, they make up between Euro9 million and Euro15 million a year, which is more than the total cost of daily compensation and is therefore infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Predumpios: Greece should follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Paladimos stated that the 100 days given to his coalition Government were insufficient to carry out this task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme”, stated the Head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening the debate on this confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the “core task” of the new Government, since “the country's presence in the Eurozone” was added.
Accordingly, Papapimos predicts a reduction in the country's fiscal deficit “premature to 9 per cent” from GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Rightly Reject the New Government’s Measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional strict economy measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the deputies of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but also opposed to any course that hindered economic recovery.
Ollie Renu, the European Commissioner for Economy and Finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not release the necessary credit of 8,000 million euros without written guarantees from all the parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
The need to legalize euthanasia and suicide with external assistance, states the Committee of Experts
Canadians are denied death, confirmed in a report by the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee claims that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative assistance, and this does not include cancer cases.
Canadians are denied death.
Only nine percent of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die, and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from various fields participated, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the penal code to allow suicide with external assistance and euthanasia, where the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
For start-up, the experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared death quality in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is at 10 places, the study notes that “death in Canada has created a culture in which people fear to argue on the subject of death”.
Whether due to medical treatment or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, report experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them die in hospital.
The country's highest rate is Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide, the authors of the report came to a conclusion that was contrary to the Federal Government ' s position, which had already stated that it was not in a position to change anything in the criminal code in respect of euthanasia and outside suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse of use, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide with outside assistance for people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, during the teleconference of Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, the majority of such cases were in countries where euthanasia and external suicide were not legalized.
Eutanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal.
Foreign suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Eutanasy
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia because, according to the 2010 Angus Reid survey, they believe that this will make it possible for people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are of less value.
With regard to those who assisted with suicide, 41 per cent of the respondents believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, it is less clear that the authors of the report say.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that the legal termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for end-of-life health care without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee encourages the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal situation already commonly used in Canadian health-care institutions, the Committee requires that it be used when it does not serve to dull the physical pain of euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some experts in the field of health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deshan, a specialist in health law, described the position of experts as “opportunity” and signed the report, since, among other things, it did not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age can ask for help to commit suicide, says a metr of Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Dashham also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the independence of the individual above all other values that constituted the social fabric of society.
He said that “there are warning signs and prohibitions in society”.
The Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expresses “a theoretical disagreement with the conclusions of the report which she described as “a personate for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who himself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, challenges, among other things, the report on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and external suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls upon President Assad to step into power
Damascus condemns the “conspiracy”
Syria Is Getting Closer
The supporters of Bashar Assad had a demonstration yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure increased against Syria Bashar Assad, which, with Russian support, opposes and condemns “conspiracy” against its country.
Two days after the suspension of Syrian membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union had tightened sanctions against Damascus, and the neighbours of Syria had appealed to President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar Assad to take power in Syria, where about forty more civilians and members of the regime's armed forces were killed.
“If Bashar were to be dear to his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new stage of political life,” said the King of Jordan, a neighbouring country to Syria, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey regretted that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had failed.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, as he hints at Syria, a neighbouring country, towards which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough course.
For its part, the United States welcomes “the expansion of consensus against Asaad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly tough course against repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a representative of the Department of State.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime ' s armed forces were killed in the Der`a area of southern Syria, reporting to the Syrian human rights observation post (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and heavy machine gun fire at Jóbar in the besieged town of Homs, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid Mullem, stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.”
He also responded sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to withdraw Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, believing that this conspiracy against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to delete Syria from the League of Arab States, the “mechanism for the protection of civilians and the need for 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers to enter the country is currently studying.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also spoke in favour of sending observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had fallen into the “paranoya”.
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the recovery plan adopted on 2 November, which includes the withdrawal of armed forces from fighting cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, yesterday referred to the League of Arab States' decision as “irresponsible”, while China called on Syria to implement the plan to emerge from the crisis but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time for markets and Italian victims
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monty, asked for some time from the markets to form his team and execute a program that would require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi administration.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties before today ' s meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate office made of non-Parliamentary technocracy.
Monty spoke of the importance of a multi-victim programme, said Francesco Nucar, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the discussions after meeting with a candidate for the Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Dianfranco Fini Chamber of Deputies said that he would have waited to see if Mario Monti Parliament would vote on trust until Friday to make sure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with the submission of Mr. Monti's limited list of dozen or other ministers to head the country of Georgia, Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervousness in stock exchanges and bond holders and asked for time.
“the time needed for democracy to prepare the Government and the programme, he emphasized, adding that he was convinced that the markets would be patient and understanding”.
His appointment as President was first approved by the markets, but concerns arose again, particularly after the sudden fall of industrial production in Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister had to form a team that included, most importantly, technocracy, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new Government should proceed until 2013, the dates of the next election, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Dianfranco Fini Chamber of Deputies, the new Government will receive a review of Parliament's credibility on Friday.
Mr. Monty had guaranteed that he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Ren stressed that “in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not comply with the 2013 budget, despite the strict economy plan of recent months, had required, inter alia, new strict measures.
The Italian bossy “boss” Emma Marchegalya, who meets him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country without growth cannot respect the deficits”.
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented the “change of the era” for Italy after 17 years of Berlusconism, a “Professor” which represented “the greatest seriousness” and “the second Italy”, according to the authors of the forewords.
The sustainability of his team is unknown.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid the early elections, since by April 2012 Italy was expected to make payments on its debt obligations amounting to Euro200,000 million.
Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Viacheslav Danilenko, assisted Iran in the development of a nuclear-weapon-usable detonator, confirmed on Monday the United States Agency specializing in the field of nuclear danger.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations agency in order to identify this scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the Iranian nuclear programme's “mayal military aspect”
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years, “as early as the sixtieth year, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds in explosive techniques”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to set up a company producing nanollamas in Kiev.
His company ' s financial difficulties led him to contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, to return to Russia.
In its report, IAEA refers to “the explicit indications that Iran's development of a nuclear detonators system” “proceeded the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technology well, but also informed the agency that he had worked most of his career on the technology as part of the military nuclear programme of his home country”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the statistics published on Monday, between 2009 and 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent, while in the same period other forms of racial and religious violence declined slightly or remained unchanged.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, representing an increase of 49 per cent, as compared with an increase of 13 per cent in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in attacks against Jews and a 14 per cent increase in religious crime.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, has increased very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
Since the decline in 2009, the number of these crimes has increased again, stresses Human Rights First, “the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly high”, adding an official report.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered as serious violations of human rights”, added a leader of Paul Lejand.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, and it adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
“Religion crimes” in federal law are the legacy of the struggle for civil rights.
This law was enacted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and today's sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes Facebook-like
On Monday, Twitter made changes to its platform to allow users to, inter alia, see who they're following, which makes it Facebook-like.
The new activity tab and the other name allow you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other Twitters, Internet users whose messages you are monitoring, and those who are monitoring yours.
This allows them to know if they publish messages if they sign up for new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "at low user rates in August" before being widely used on Monday, and declared AFP a Twitter press release for Caroline Penner.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively vague and uses rather vague terms (RT for someone else's recommunication, #followfish for the recommendation to be tracked by other users), mostly by giving pleasure to experienced users, opens itself to a wider audience, providing users with something closer to the popular Facebook and Google+ social networks.
Online users discussed this innovation with the use of Twitters on the Internet.
"It's useless, obsessive and too much like Facebook."
Functional activity will help me to keep track of certain elements of my stream on Twitter, writing @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the Constitution of the “Gold Rule” of the budget
The leadership of a large coalition of social democracies and Christian democracies in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a “gold rule” into the constitution to reduce the fiscal deficit and thus avoid the possible reduction of Austria's public credit rating agencies (trinim A).
The Chancellor-Democracy Werner Faymann personally announced the decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with Austria's public debt of 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the 60 per cent ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay fell by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest of three thousand million euros more than every year, cited Vice-Cunkler and the Foreign Minister of Christian Democratics Michael Spindeleger.
Austria is thus meeting the requirements of the Eurozone summit in Brussels on 26 October; Heads of State and Government requested a reduction in budgetary deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or an equal law.
The decision adopted by the Austrian Government recalls the “German model” as Germany was the first European country to adopt the “rule”.
By 2017, the structural deficit in the State budget should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year, and from 2017, the structural deficit in the State budget of the federal State in any year should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP, and land, like communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to force public debt to fall below the 60 per cent mark of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Eschiko Noda
Threats to new currency intervention
The Prime Minister of Japan, Eshiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new transactions on the exchange market if the value went on growing.
We intervene the last time that Mr. Noda Senate explained the excessive valority of the yen exchange rate.
On Tuesday the yen grew almost to the historic mark that led the Japanese authorities to the intervention on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold a dollar yen to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had established a new record of force since 1945.
Since then, however, the yen has been growing steadily, driven by the purchases of investors who see it as “a haven” in these sad times of economic decline around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic plan of 105 yen, close to the level that caused the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth of Japanese currency harms Japanese exports because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces Japanese firms ' income from abroad when converted to national currency.
“Japan fights to restore itself” after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (east-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who feared that the yen would kill the fragile embryo of reconstruction.
The third largest economic power in the world resumed its growth in the third quarter to 1.5 per cent as compared with the previous quarter, the first time in a year, thanks to the growth in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect Japan's “fundamental economic performance”.
The Finance Minister Jun Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened its two-day board on monetary policy on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to ease the yen.
But the deputy manager, Hiroshima Yamaguchi, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “the appropriate steps” to realize that no further environmental mitigation should be expected.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the emigrating organization increased its price ceiling by 5,000 million yen (47 million euros) to the purchase of treasury bonds, raising to 57,000 million yen (Euro519,000 million) the amounts it allocates to purchase various financial instruments to market securities.
Eurozone
Rates are growing, stock exchanges fluctuate
The risk of debt contamination undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, the rates in fragile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, the European exchanges went a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m. CAC, 40 lost 1.4 per cent and finished trading at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London fell by 0.1%.
Because of the new difficulties in lending to the eurozone countries in difficult situations, stock markets around the world continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
"Investigated investors are simply too concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Prattt, an institutional broker quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7 per cent under the burden of further market doubts about Europe ' s ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has looked forward to seeing Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the narrow corridor until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsuige Akino, the manager of the Ichioshi Investment Management Fund
This return of concern over the future of the eurozone takes place in a single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its bottom in one and a half months.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, falling by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, it fell after the Congress of the Chancellor of Angela Merkel CDD on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, inter alia, an opportunity for a difficult country to leave the eurozone, without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
This morning, on Tuesday, the income of the Italian 10-year bond reached 6.85 per cent, while the income of the Spanish bond reached 6.2 per cent.
These difficulties, with interest rates in the southern countries but also in France, continue to raise concerns among the participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monty, asked for time exchanges to restore the situation in Italy under threat of paralysis under the weight of his debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Paúdimas, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be “the main task” of his Government.
Spain was under market fire before parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The interest rates between Germany and Spain for 10 years' debt reached a new historical ceiling.
Pending Eurozone growth
France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent because of increased household consumption.
Insee, however, has revised to reduce the figure of the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnating.
And economists are most concerned about quarter four.
Germany, in turn, recorded a growth rate of 0.5 per cent for the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected to be 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a theme on which energy policies cannot be decided after a brief discussion or emotion has taken place.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings are a cause for reflection on the fate and place of nuclear energy.
It will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
France must base its views on objective facts and on sound data.
We now have 7,000 million people on the planet, and demographic development will double the need for electricity by 2050, unless the vast majority of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to supplement the growing resource deficit in order to continue the generation of electricity at all times, bearing in mind the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to address the climate imbalance, a theme that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukusim accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
It is not Belgium ' s case, which depends on the need to find a source that can replace nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, are only a few of those who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided to add one plant after Fucusim to its kit by resuming the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident in Tri-May Island.
Although Germany's renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, the validity is contrary to this argument.
Berlin's choice will be the result of an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be detectable.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European turbin champion, which gives it 30 per cent of its electricity, is the same as the largest coal and gas consumer because of the blackout wind; hence, emissions of carbon dioxide and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher respectively than the average in Europe.
On the other hand, due to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40 per cent more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy, the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the collateral of the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies are benefiting from the lowest cost of electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will result in a high price increase in electricity, which will give illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price which most French refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the energy policy of the country has made it possible to establish an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole tribe of specialized international trade in small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another sector.
If France had decided to renounce nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from the French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to work for sixty years if the manufacturer were to be closed?
In order to resolve the equation of energy, it must be recognized that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions indicates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of safety is clearly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that controls the existing energy centres, such as Flammanville, in a non-exclusive and transparent manner.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are filled with the same obsession of security.
Over the 50 years, the atomic industry has experienced three major incidents.
Only one, Tri-May Island, occurred under normal conditions of exploitation, but without any effect on the human or the environment
In Chernobyl, the reactor structure and an unexplained human error led to a tragedy.
At Fucusim, some people seem to forget that two natural disasters caused unprecedented forces to kill tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry learns from this accident, as it has learned from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between security agencies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project to address these phenomena.
Since it is considered by all power specialists who wish to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Famanville would be a wonderful gift to Arva and EDF competitors, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of atomic energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best mix of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and prejudiced manoeuvres to prevail over a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration - the burden or benefit of the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized on various sides - overloading of police, judicial and administrative services, subordinate numbers and compatibility with France's self-proclaimed status as “State of Human Rights”.
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students in news reports when the Minister of Home Affairs (Liberación of 23 May) stated that France “does not need foreign talents, stoners and waiters”.
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is much agreement on the right and left on the matter.
For the right-hand side, it was proposed by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 stated that “900,000 unemployed people will not become a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers” and by left, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “is unable to accept the world's poor”.
Differences only in the level of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the country by the Polish plumber was felt by both left and right.
Both sides see the burden on the French economy and French society in immigration.
The difference is in the level of generosity that they will allow immigrants to enjoy.
François Allland's program was limited to banking, saying that "joint work would solve our problem of immigration."
This view of immigration as a burden and problem can give an electoral advantage, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book that summarized the latest data on immigration (Special People: How migration has shaped our world and will determine our future, May 2011, the publication of Princeton University, 352 pages), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restriction to immigration reduces growth and reduces employment.
Fears of immigrant influence are based on the perception that they are able to replace local workers, especially those with low skills, with low wages.
But experience has shown that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than replacing local labour by carrying out jobs for which local labour is scarce.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not involve job offers.
Positive effect on wages
As it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between local and immigrant communities has had a positive impact on the salaries of local workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1 per cent in migration flows increased by 0.6 to 0.9 per cent in real long-term wages.
And this is without regard to the fact that the diversity enjoyed by immigrants contributes to new ideas and economic growth (in the context of the Nobel Prize American laureates, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make net social security gains, giving an average of 1 per cent of the overall European budgets.
The World Labour Organization, for example, has estimated that in Germany, an immigrant who is 30 years old will, for his or her lifetime, make a net return (costs minus expenses) on the average of 150,000 euros.
At the beginning of her mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy was going to get into the missing points of growth.
The above teeth, which used to scare immigrants, have had an even opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, the European democracy remains to be understood
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that by inventing it in Athens more than 2,000 years ago, it experienced the tragedies of World War I, the totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulala, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonel in Greece.
Some believed that it was sufficient for democracy to triumph over its enemies to be as direct and as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's time, "Malgo" knows it's from the surface of thinking.
Universal vote, although a condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for it, and may even be a “tool of repression” as did Etienne Sturo once.
No, democracy requires many other things — public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political and democratic crisis.
In this regard, the pallinody of a true-lived Greek referendum would have a double-deploying effect, showing both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and incoherence.
This duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved and, according to many, republican soldiers are now kissing the wrong direction.
We won't win anything by requiring a series of national referendums, organized as we please and in chaotic order.
"Cart-Blanche" for an absolute European monarch or jump with legs tied to a nationalism -- what a choice for a citizen!
No, we have a vision, not of the guillotine blade, but of the implementation - in a joint, clear and continuous manner - of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Spain, and there are no more crises to list, because there is only one crisis, the European crisis.
Europe as a whole was subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, and was suffering from weakness and lack of solidarity.
Europe as a whole has been humiliated in the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of European sovereignty, but Europe as a whole is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The European project must be brought back to national sovereignty as a matter of urgency.
Because only working together Europeans can reduce the debt burden of everyone, get rid of markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
Breaking out of the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, without causing us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the socialists and Jacques Deer, everything now demands the European Economic Government.
Let's do that.
But to imagine it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has come into play, is another madness and a new impasse.
We must start a new European construction phase.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “make” Republicans.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build Europe, one at the economic level.
This can only be done by establishing a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine people's European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
The wordless chips are spreading more and more.
The World Exhibition Opened on Tuesday in Vilnius, Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end at 11% of the growth in world sales of microprocessors (bank maps, SIM cards), exceeding 6,000 million, according to Eurosmart.
The most important technology sector, which allows for the payment of public transportation or purchases, is simply a map over the reading device.
This year the world will sell 460 million wireless chip cards, compared with 320 million a year earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected at 580 million) to almost 10% of the world market for chips (6,925 million cards).
Europe, long lagged behind Asia and the Pacific, is now moving forward in the area of indefinite payments.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards have already been equipped with this function, and 75,000 terminals have been received.
France is starting at a much smaller point: there are 40,000 wireless Visa maps.
But big shops are growing pace.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million wireless Pass MasterCard.
To move to a higher speed, banks must supply their customers with equipment.
"Two large organizations in France have promised to distribute bank cards for use-free to their clients systematically in the future,” reported Gérard Nebuy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
The banks test charges by using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first step in developing the future payment, i.e. the mobile phone.
So far, few machines have been equipped with NFC technology (Communication of the passing field) necessary for such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they must actually spread out next year."
"We are counting on world sales of between 80 and 120 million units in 2012, explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agrocule announced the experiment from December to June of the following year in Qana.
The iPhones of some 200 clients and staff will be equipped with drawbacks.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing a market proposal for his clients to pay for their mobile phones.
The terrorist front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long- assumed links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated on Sunday that the Algerians were now confident.
“The way in which these two organizations are used, and the reports of the secret services show that they cooperate actively,” he explained without going into detail.
Paris seems to have come up with similar conclusions.
An investigation into the abduction of two French people in Niger in January revealed two links.
The people arrested at Niamey's restaurant near Aqmi, Antoine de Leoquour and Wensan Delari were apparently killed the next day, along with several of the kidnappers during the French Special Forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone-cards belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
An analysis of the calls pointed to several interlocutors in Mali, Nigeria and Niger.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has lived long in Madiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, a wheelhouse in Boko Haram, and the other is said to be close to Aqmi and a sect.
“This is a step forward, but certainly there is a need to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“For many years it has been known that the sect receives financial and mental support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and declarations of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of death row and more sophisticated explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, D.C., is now exerting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems that Boko Haram poses.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people of no interest.
Rapid Success
Founded in Majiguri in 2002, at a mosque, school and imma-Fundamentalist Mohammed Yousuf, Boko Haram, what Hausa means is "Western education is sin" -- proclaims the establishment of an Islamic Emirata in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It is politicized and demands strict compliance with the Sharia, and its activists have fought against the wicked central government.
It focuses mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Bko Harm's activists were particularly active, carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, impromptu.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Youssuff, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and going beyond its northern axis.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Jos and then killed one in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram launched the first suicide attack on a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local office of the Organization of the United Nations would be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axle in Africa, which is proceeding from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is of concern to all security experts now.
Today, when Aqmi is strengthened in Mali and Niger, and al-Shabaab Somalis are active in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a discussion with Presidents Goodak Jonathan Alain Juppe, he warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
World, as seen by republican presidential candidates
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can a crisis - weakened America bring about a complex world with simple, more precise, simplified ideas?
If they heard candidates for presidents from the Republicans, the voters could believe that.
For days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have become very loud, but few, detailed statements on foreign policy that are traditionally a strong part of the Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and assistance to Israel are often mixed up with one another.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of bringing forward the Good Party, threatened to file a Chinese complaint at the WTO and accused them of “using his own currency in the first place is a sensitive issue for America, which has been affected by the migration of its entire industry to Asia.
It's worse if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama in China, and the only candidate in difficult foreign politics could not overcome an emotion-prone attitude.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama's position).
But Huntsman, who holds on to the bottom of the ratings, was not heard.
Reagan style
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme.
"If they chose me, I would stop Iran, he would bring me back."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel ' s military assistance by blaming Obama of not fulfilling his promises to that partner.
Businessman Herman Kane, the second in the candidate rating, demonstrated a frustrating ignorance of cases.
He had recently called for resistance to the Chinese military threat because Beijing was trying to obtain nuclear power — evidently not knowing that China had already possessed it since 1964!
The Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes against Iran, said that he was prepared to use the United States army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The terrorist suspects prohibited by Obama in 2009 also recommended that Kane, Perry and Mr. Michel Bahman be tortured.
It's all very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCaine, a heavy foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower the tone of the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his forced dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of “the children” from Iraq, his catch in Libya, which brought him the reputation of a weak policy.
But it's not that simple.
The population considers the national security balance of Obama to be positive, which has eliminated Ben Ladena.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that is tied up in sand.
And affirming that America needs to be redesigned economically to restore its leadership, Obama is right.
Northern Flow, new gate to enter the Russian gas into Europe.
The North River gas pipeline linking Western Europe and Russia directly along the Baltic Sea floor has been launched.
It is designed to provide 30 million households with gas equivalents.
Gasprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate the event with a rush.
Over 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part on the Baltic coasts last Tuesday, between the orchestra and the artifacts, the opening of the North Flow, a new gas pipeline that links Russia and Germany directly under water.
The chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, Russian President dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fiion, and his Dutch colleague, Marta Rutte, together returned a symbolic valve controlling the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
A new gas pipeline of 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will result in access to Western Europe each year on the first line of 1,224 km, linking the Leningrad region to the land of Meklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 cubic metres of gas equivalent to the entire consumption of France.
The possibility of constructing a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project faced bitter opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
Indeed, the Northern Flow will allow gas to be transported directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will find it more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment, Warsaw's debate did not stop before the comparison of the North Pot with the new "Herman-Sovette Pact" that suggests an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means the question is politically sensitive.
In support of this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of losing Europe energy, the project created a gate between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has succeeded in gaining an understanding of the direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already on the rise.
"This pipeline is part of the co-operation with Russia, it's a new artery that is organically binding us," argued François Fión, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent major gas contracts are important and politically, and economically.
This explains the wide range of smiles on the faces of the Heads of Gasprom, who were present in Ludmina in large quantities, the gas supply point.
The design of that gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel within concrete to protect it from anchor ships.
It lies on the seabed, at an average depth of 200 metres.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left since the Second World War.
"A hundred have had to be removed or destroyed as precautions," said Jens Müller, the press secretary of North Pot.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, with no bursts throughout it, no valves and no service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not happy that the Russian State Company would live forever off its coast.
"In the event of an accident, we'll cover the gas flow in less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
So in the case of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline is going to go into the air.
But it seems unlikely to be designers who designed the seams that were only designed for leaks every 100,000 years.
The state of the pipeline will be monitored by a submarine that carries the ship, for external observation, as well as by a machine that circulates inside the pipeline.
A cigar-shaped apparatus shall be injected within the pipe 1 meter in diameter and pushed forward by the gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at 3 metres per second, it provides accurate information on any deterioration of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
The gas shall be marketed only by pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies joined forces to carry out the project.
The leader remains Gasprom, which owns 51 per cent of capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9 per cent).
The five companies established a joint venture called the North Stream, which was mandated to build and operate gas pipelines.
Its headquarters is in Tsuga in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for 20 years, with the possibility of extending the full volume of gas transport.
“Gazprom will pay for full volume regardless of how much gas is actually being transported,” states Jens Muller.
The gas pipeline was financed by 30 per cent shareholders and 70 per cent bank loans.
The total cost of the work would be Euro74 million for two pipelines.
GDF Suez investment is about 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they will pay for their expenses, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline comes out of the Baltic Sea in Ljubmina on a sandy shore piled up with soft trees.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the gas output terminal.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before it is pumped into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
This will be 3 million per hour at full capacity and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine brandy
Moleskine, a company created by Italians 15 years ago, will return a taste for a letter.
He's got the aroma of adventures, of hours spent writing in the light of the candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easy to learn from a rectangular black cover, along a rubber, on the yellow and white pages, as if yellow with time.
However, Moleskine’s notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to sell designer notebooks.
Maria Cebrorgundi, the company’s then consultant, claimed responsibility for launching a new product.
The note is inspired by old production techniques, the clamp, the lubricated cotton cloth used, for example, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook is said to be highly valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskin brought an old and forgotten thing into line with today's taste, which was a cult for Vanguardian artists until the twentieth century," said Maria Cebrorgundi, who had since become the controlling brand in Modo Modo.
Success has come.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent to 12.7 million.
We have gone far from producing the first few years, when there were only 3,000 notebooks produced.
Moleskine has crossed the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It's hard to fix the profile of a typical buyer, because the notebook is the same as a businessman, a student, and a man of a free profession.
Moleskine’s buyers are cosmopolitan, have broad views and are organized.
A small Italian company, initially with only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and one in New York.
She distributed her notebooks in the Fnac bookshops, shops in small towns, and was able to become well known.
“We followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter, despite the appearance of an e-mail,” explains Maria Cebrongodi.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine; recently the brand organized an exhibition called the Enteric Way, where architects and artists displayed their own notebooks.
In August, he also put down leopard covers on the occasion of a movie festival in Locarno.
Using its successes and cultural aura, Moleskine developed a variety of products that now include bags, pens, handbags for computers.
Success that led to envy: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the Investment Fund of SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, who wrote a new page in Molekine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
About 19 per cent of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th Week of Disabled Persons begins today.
Despite the policy of public charity initiated in 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average rate, 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the general population.
Debate?
“No,” says Eric Blanche, Director General of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for persons with disabilities.”
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not 2 but 3 times greater."
"Just yet, there's a lot of work ahead."
It must be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for a disabled person.
Among them are more elderly: 37 per cent over 50 years of age (17 per cent on average).
They do not have a baccalaureate, 80 per cent of them do not have a baccalaureate, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, is very common, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In short, these are all the criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that constitute the essence of the problem”, according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about the mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepredre, commissioned by Cité, revealed that interviewees had a low level of knowledge of disability and “provided themselves to be good people in gardenes or mentally or mentally incomplete”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from having 6 per cent of disabled workers set out in the law passed in 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"We're about 3% today," says Pierre Blance, Director General of Agefiph, who's responsible for collecting taxes from companies that don't comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “debts” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, declined in 2007-2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 tax law brought pressure on the company,” explains Pierre Blance.
“But this improvement also reflects increased consciousness, particularly in large businesses.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of the organizations with 20 to 49 workers have disabled workers against 82 per cent of the organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: What happiness.
Before fighting the Blue evening on Tuesday (20.45), Eden Azar and Georges Leekens did not conceal the pleasure they had in this friendly match.
We won't make it to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the painting is symbolic.
Sitting next to the arena of the Arena, Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar are dead.
Five months after leaving his match attacker against Turkey, a Belgian coach can only commend him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden and his progress and with the fact that he's a Belgian."
"I want to go further, to believe Lille's player.
That the contrast between his achievements at the club and his assembly is one whole is justified by him.
"In Lila, I'm looking round a year, and in Belgium, I'm not."
"I have to earn points."
Abandoned in reserve, on the eve of this match with France, on the game against Romania on Friday evening, Azar arrived at Saint-Deni to finally "get up."
Not forgetting, however, the notion of pleasure.
He supported the Blue since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also enhances the special nature of this match.
He remembers that on the other side is Mother (Dubshi), Johan (Qabe) and Adil (Rah).
"Just our roads crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness."
Leekens kindly remembered "the pride".
"Glory" to play a "predictment match."
“Glory” also claims as “necessary” that France “renews a very high team” just one year after the Nashun trauma.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunder; he admired.
Now that Belgium misss the next Europe, a technical athlete will fly in one plane with blue management... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll see this in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident.
Portugal, Paulo Bento, is starting its return match against Bosnia (22.00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality on their way to him.
“By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paul Bent is already looking at himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt in his mind that the Cathedral, which runs since September 2010, has been equivalent to Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes happy.
But there's a match that has to be played, and Bosnia has to be won.
Given the 0-0 Friday in hell Zenica, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it was not able to achieve the promised goal of calming it.
“This is a good result, however, which carries a certain risk.”
But on their brightly lit stadium, de la Luss in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, who is going to be thrilled, even though the match will be very tense," said optimistically, but thinking Bent.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of coming on Euro 2012," discussed his successor, Carlos Keiros.
The Portuguese are required to win on Fridays of a match against Bosnia.
No one could have the Bosniacs.
"This is a good result, which has, however, some risk, "regards Bent.
"We'll play against a team that has a lot of technical merit and has lots of personal virtues," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "not give them time to think."
It's a good idea, if only this time it was realistic.
