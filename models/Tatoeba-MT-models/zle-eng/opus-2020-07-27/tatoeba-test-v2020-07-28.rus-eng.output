Why does he hate me?
Stop snooping him.
He knows her from high school.
Tom pretended like nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident cost him his life.
He snuck the bottle.
We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I disagreed.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't get me wrong.
Why are you so mysterious?
You just run from life's problems.
Get the snow out.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed the exam.
Eat while it's hotter.
So I had to wait three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks she's an idiot.
I told him to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you'd come either.
I ran into Tom in Boston last week.
Tom's a beauty.
Tom didn't know Mary liked to cook.

We're in Germany!
We were sleeping under the open sky.
Don't lock the door.
When are you free?

I have to go to work right now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
Oblivion is one of the five senses.
What do you got?
They're afraid of him.
Tom's at work.

I was expecting good news from them.

What's your favorite movie?
So I didn't have to ask twice.
You need to go to Boston.
I jumped for joy.

I stayed home that day because it was raining.
Is there a pharmacist around here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.

We can discuss this later.
It's a little helpful.
Cats in Ancient Egypt were sacred animals.

But I don't have any money.
How's Mary's new dress?
He had fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I'll tell her.
Can you trust the secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Call her back somewhere.
I was right there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
That's what I'm talking about.

I'm very unhappy.

I didn't give it to Tom.
It's a weird rumor.
I know you're rich.

I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I'm not lying.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more to buy?
I'm not going to starve.
He got in the car and left.
Tell him everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.

Don't make me do that.
What are you smiling at?

Fadel went to school.
I used to work with Tom.
Tom and I are team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more often every time I see her.

Everyone except Tom has hats.
She gives him anything he asks.
Is that sold?
I'm getting angry.
Do you have more?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
This only adds to the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a mouthful in the toilet.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They've already left.
Can I have your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the bag.
That's what I did when I was a kid.
Something very good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't be mad at somebody else's business.
Who's the blue T-shirt?
Tom's got an American accent.
I don't have any money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are useful.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She kept herself for marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.

I barely managed to get to the train.
I don't like to argue.
Do you like science fiction?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go up there.
His house is behind the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many pens!
Mary, are you all right now?
I fixed the mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 hits.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave Tom a break, threw a glass of wine through him, and, in a firm step, walked out of the restaurant, a dead silence reigned.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We found them.
Tom will paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you're gonna need a loan.
Tom's father, in prison, never writes Tom.
It's expensive.
I haven't heard from him for 100 years.
I didn't know Tom could not swim.
I thought it was time for all of us to meet.
Everyone's interested in Japan.
Tom's very easy to get out of himself.
Please, just do everything like me.
Stay there.
I don't agree with him.
That's what's called luck.
It was so dark in the room that I had to get through my feel.
How many aircraft are in the U.S. Army?
She's your teacher?
Sleep again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom realizes he's no longer needed.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in pots of winter.
I speak French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom should have said Mary.
Why do everyone look at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so weird.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
How long have you been waking up?
Get the trash.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy some candles?
Canada is an ice hockey family.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They'd agree.

You tried to talk to him?
Where are the other prisoners?
Today, so many things have happened.
I saw a man hit by a car.
We accepted their invitation.

I'm tired.
You know what your kids are doing right now?
Do you want her to stay?
He misses her.
Tell me, please, I'm right.
We saw a castle in front of us.
Tom continued to hit her.
Six goes in front of the family.
I went to my grandfather's grave today.

Tom and Maria stopped laughing when they noticed that John was crying.
I'm gonna meet Tom.
Tom lost his finger.

Did they get on the wrong bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of friends.
This area has changed completely.
Tom's an anti-Semitism.
What is your strongest side?
Tom doesn't like to be pushed.
I wonder when Angelika Agurbash sang a song on Neklaeva's words, could she imagine that he would run for the presidents?

Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom always speaks frankly.
Thomas must be there by the age of 30.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he was extremely tired.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why don't you look for him?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
I wouldn't want anything better.
Tom wants popcorn.
My favorite restaurant was burned.

Who's the type?

Get out!
I knew what Jacksons were doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three grandchildren.
He wants peanut butter.
You're lucky.
Tom starts to get drunk a little bit.
I barely understood him.
He escaped the bait.
You can live in a big house and still don't feel any sense of comfort.
I'm waiting for Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
Red is better.
The universe is endless.
I'm not ready to do it yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom for a word?
Don't be like that.
When was Tom arrested?
We're eating at six.
The deer was a victim of the lion.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try and talk her out for us.
Are you with us?
Make a wish.
Tom's alive.
The log may be in the water for ten years, but it will not become a crocodile.
Tom pretended he didn't understand what Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw it happen.
I think there can be no other reason than this one.
I'm very happy right now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How do you always get to be so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What are you doing?
So you bought it?
Man's as old as he's feeling, and woman as much as she looks.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
It's been snowy in the last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everything seems happy.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
You don't want another daughter?
I like walking along the river.
You can come with me.
That dictionary is a big gift for us.
"How long before dinner?" five minutes.
Let her know.
Mary spent all her time at work.
Tom sat on his motorcycle and called it.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I was waiting up to ten.
Tom usually says the first thing that comes into his mind.
Why do you want to leave?

It wasn't worth it.
What's with your computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not gonna fire you.
You really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend that much money?

What did Tom get?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed the door was open.
That's when I damaged my venisontop.
There's nothing more to tell me about him.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay up there.
Come home early, Bill.
She was sitting on her chair reading the magazine.
From that moment on, it is prohibited to cry.
If I knew it, I'd tell you.
Here's the house he lived in.
I'm not talking to you.
Eat my chocolate?
It's painted white, it's more like a house.
I found it difficult to find an original quote.
I had no idea you knew her.
What's the point of doing this?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give Tom more time.
You didn't tell me what Tom said in French.
Tom goes back to Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a French film with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.
I think Tom was a good player.
He only blames others, he never blames himself.
You can play banjo?
Tom came up to Mary and hugged her.
"When will you come back?" "All depends on the weather."
How Many Tortoises Live?
How safe is it?
Your message has been received.
It took me three years to complete the construction of my house.
I was angry.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do this.
Tom didn't want us to attend his party.
I suddenly realized what was going on.
She said she'd be late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need it today.
Tom is likely to win.
What would you like to see, Grandpa Christmas bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your adventure-seeker's spirit?
Why are you mad at me?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've already met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
The captain ordered his men to shoot.
Sit there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom is engaged to my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, you have to think about a man, act like a lady, look like a girl, and work as a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I couldn't.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in a hat.
Put him in the regiment.
I thought you found someone else.
A huge number of vehicles are always on this road.
You tricked us all.
I don't think Tom has brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
Pretend foolish to pretend that you make me believe that I believe what you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I've been pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
Do you think that's possible?
He got sick to finish with everything.
You think Tom's locked up?
If it's true, she's better than me.

What's the word for that song?
Mary likes to hurt her brother.
Law on my side.
So we had to find a place to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was scheduled for the day of the professor’s birth.
Your phone rang a few times while you were in the shower.
She went out for him because of her money.
Not a bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
Tom has to make his own decisions.
The account, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
You have your birthday soon.
Count it out.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom's been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I downloaded online.
I think that's why it's less than thirty.
Have you had a drink?
Of course, he is best suited for this work.
You're making it easier for me.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I love you.
It doesn't look like you're very busy.
Deadline's gone.
You look a lot like me.
You know those men?
Tom left the room without saying a word to anyone.
That probably didn't happen.
Are you done with lunch?
Tom and Mary talked at least an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He was trying to save her.
If you press this button, the door will open.
How many ties do you need?
I'm back to help you.
Tell me about them in detail.
Have you heard the last rumours?
I'd show you how to do this.
I begged Tom to come.
You've got a tuft.
My mother taught me not to waste my money.
We could walk.
She died yesterday afternoon.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took a seat for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I shouted for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know it matters to you.
They all knew her.
We better stop.
I won't be late any more.
I'm terribly hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom's taking care of the horses.
Why don't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if they're killed.
They cut Tom off the life support machine.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Sorry about my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom is twice as young as you.
Tom closed the lid.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is the heat that can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you say Tom first?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He wouldn't dare do that.
The 12-hour journey made me sick.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
No one saw us do it.
He came back two days later.
Tom started the day.
We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are engaged.
Food!
So you helped wash the windows?
It's beyond my power.
That was yesterday.
I'm beginning to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm just here.
Don't tell me what really happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
What do you say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Come down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these postcards.
Tom didn't realize he had made a mistake.
I dropped the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read that book yesterday.
Where did Tom find that picture?
Tom gave me both money and advice.
What do you want me to say?
Please open the door.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
She married him at the age of 20.
I can't give anyone that dictionary.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.
I know Tom is superior to Mary.
I didn't have time today to do that.
Mary said she'd help him.
The multiple from "person" is "people", not "persons".
It's two steps.
You ruined it!
I think that's why I should have stayed in Boston.
You invited him?
Tom told me what the baby's name is.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston right now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're a teacher.
Tom will find you.
We all have weaknesses.
I hope they pay you well.
Tom didn't eat any meat.
I found this book interesting.
Hundreds of unemployed people sleep there day and night.
I'll probably be late.
Your kids know French?
Tom yelled and ran out of the room.
That soup's giving away the fish.
There's lots of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in her coffee.
Did you not know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They tried to win time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in a horrible way, from the standpoint of the Jews, to the Galatians ’ dialect of Amarithian language instead of Hebrew, thus showing the insolence of claims that there was a sacred language that was particularly close to God in prayer.
Finally, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So they paid three hundred dollars for that.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
Weather forecast was not wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to cook you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read that book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him burn in the shower.
You remind me of me young.
Tom's on duty tonight.
I'm always busy.
I'm playing the piano for a while.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom got up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in my room.
Recreation is important.
Have you called Lucy yet?
A good idea came to her mind at the last moment.
There's a very black air in this room.
Why aren't you in the sweat today?
A pound is a unit of weight.
I wouldn't talk to him if I were you.
Japan needs a lot of paper.
It's very hard.
You betrayed me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems very busy.
And I'm very happy to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help Tom.
Is that my book?
The style is routine.
Who else is on your list?
Don't give me my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I could know what to tell them.
Tom's children must be missing him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He hid that fact from me.
Did you save me?
He screamed loudly in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom learned Mary by voice.
You don't even look at me.
Tom's too lazy to do it.
Please stop arguing.
Grandpa always said the days will come, just like today.
I didn't tell her that.
I want to live in Australia.
No one could help them.
When did you meet her?
As a result of your timely efforts, the people who have tried to help you in your labors have not been able to put themselves in danger.
After the earthquake, many decided to sleep in tents on the street.
Tell your men to drop their weapons.
There's a secret door in the library.
Mike has friends in Florida.
We both laughed.
We need three more bars.
I like this office.
I have a friend who lives in England.
Tom's doing his best.
Why won't you be tomorrow?
We need to get to know each other better.
Somebody said something, but I didn't.
Someone has to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get himself to the hospital.
I sat next to Tom.
Your voice's upset.
You've always been so selfish?
I think that's going to be a great benefit to you.
Tell Tobe here by mid-third.
It's not a god of the message of science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
Would you like a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was on the verge of starving death.
I've learned so much from my mistakes that I think I'll do a few more!
My favorite color is blue.
I have brought some corrections.
You don't know what you're talking about.
The Football player hit the ball.
It's a good book.
Tom didn't say anything.
I didn't know Tom would do that.
Positive nuclear kernels attract negative electrons.
You're so wrong!
Tom opened his bag.
Everyone looked at my feet.
Tom was the first to arrive.
Don't help me, I want to do it myself.
I'm not feeling well.
Come to me.
Guest showed me 8,000 yen for a room number.
I stopped chasing the fashions.
Tom's allergic.
I know this girl's father.
I don't know exactly what my kids want for Christmas.
Why did she do that?
Tom's got it?
I finally got to work.
Tom's in the kitchen, the cathet is in the kitchen.
The temperature decreased by 3 degrees.
Tom refused to let Mary go to a party.
Tom won't ask me to do that.
I want to be like him.
I'll never tell you.
The bus was full.
Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I've got a hangover.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car's selling well.
I have to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words upset me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what I should have done.
Say hi to her from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's response blew up.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I have to go now.
Where was your son?
I saw it at the store.
The world is violent.
I'm in a weird dream.
That's why there's no business for anyone but yourself.
I'm from Sidzooka.
Tom slept in his backyard all the trees.
Saturday is the day he's free.
I wonder what happened to her.
The last bus leaves in 30 minutes.
He told me he'd do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you so much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
Eating is understandable.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm happy with what's there.
What are you just here now?
It's nice to meet you.
I want to know if Tom and Mary are eating meat.
Tom wouldn't listen to my advice.
You want to say something to Tom?
You don't want a son yet?
How can I lose weight?
I think we should tell you what we're going to be late.
Where are our friends?
Don't forget us.
They tried to hide their concerns.
There's a big organ in this council.
I don't think you're right.
Did you find him?
You want me to come in?
Please take me on this side of the light.
Tom shot and killed the tiger.
I've never met anyone above me.
How much is the yummy flour?
I want a cold drink.
What's your difference?
Each nation has its own special character.
A healthy person doesn't know the price of health.
Did I miss anything interesting?
I had to tell them myself.
The audience was laughing.
You don't pay attention to me.
I got a broken ankle.
You like to take pictures, don't you?
He's a noble knight without fear and fear.
They hate women.
I have almost no small stuff with me.
Tom tried to run.
What color does her eye have?
Go quickly!
You overestimate him.
How many weeks ago did this happen?
Tom slept in his room.
Do you know why this is happening?
I looked around me.
Tom is still alive.
Hawaiian is my favorite pizza.
Tom was a hockey fan.
Who was the first one here?
You're singing in the chorus?
Were you at home last night?
I've been homeless for three months.
She said she wanted to win.
Prices will be reduced.
I'm glad Tom wasn't hurt.
I've never hurt anyone.
It wasn't an accident.
Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom's yelling at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom kind of said Mary's from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very permeable.
Again and again, there are obstacles in our lives, some call them problems, others talking about opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him fishing.
You won't have this problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog lying in the woods.
He told me he wanted to leave the company.
You want to come in?
You and I both know that's not gonna happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need action, not words.
Tom was suspected of being a spy.
You just run away from trouble.
The days without women are like garden without flowers.
You can't leave your baby alone.
She'll do it if she can.
I'm done with it.
I put a hit on the bait.
Don't leave points on the table!
We sold our souls for money.
You work tonight?
The wind is over.
I rarely met her.
I know it's really important.
I eat an apple.
Tom is taught as well as other boys in their class.
I'm not hungry.
Their job is to cook food for the soldiers.
What happens if we're caught?
I can put things in the box.
I'm gonna order your bedroom tonight.
He has five languages.
Tom had a complicated childhood.
I'm divorced.
How did you know Tom was sick?
I like how you say my name.
Tom didn't tell me anything.
Guys in this class aren't as tall as Bill.
Shall we go?
I knew I could trust you!
Tom got the wood in the fire.
"Never has love killed anyone." "Did you ask Romeo and Juliet?"
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It's like the operation of a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving yet?
Neither Tom nor Mary was ever in Boston.
Have you ever had a solo?
If I had the money, I'd buy the computer.
Is Tom smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's at school, isn't he?
Let us know, please.
Tom nodded and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Are you in pain somewhere?
He couldn't go because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think that's why we can trust it.
There are many mysteries in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's an apple rot.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom's favorite town.
Too bad when someone dies.
You're better now?
What makes you think we might be interested?
I'll think of you every day until I'm gone.
It was a bad bet.
Thinking that she was coming alone had troubled me.
The river's a sizer.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I was watching them.
Do you really love her?
He gave the facts without comment.
He was dark green.
He'll be here.
Do you have a message?
Tom called me unexpectedly yesterday.
We really need this.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the bees.
I've decided to give up.
The accident took away their only son.
Everyone knows there's something new in this old capital.
I'm always careful.
I went to the market.
You got towels?
Tell him I have his keys.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Do we have a chance to win?
I knew I had to stay home.
He understands French.
Tom got on a bus going to Boston.
Falling down, she's wrong with the elbow.
I'm sick.
We'll deal with Tom later.
Do you want to be rich?
You're being called.
You both made a big impression today, I'm proud of you.
She doesn't like my manner of speaking.
Mary wants another baby.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.
Tom didn't go to Boston by car.
The weather forecast cannot be relied on.
She's still young.
Did you listen to Tom's advice?
Tom said he was a pilot.
How's your father?
Did they say when?
This car looks angry.
Do you study English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money for a new dress.
Why does the moon shine at night?
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.
You don't need that anymore.
Tom did it on purpose.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do it.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Are you familiar with everyone here?
Tom couldn't read until he was 13.
I prefer quail eggs.
She lives in Muhosransk.
Those people who don't know me better don't interest me.
Is that your first arrival in Australia?
These are wise.
Tom asked for some water.
The loser had all three nets given to him by him.
I can't go with you because I'm very busy.
A pound of fig costs two and a half euros.
A lot of animals in the zoo?
She's proud of her class.
At other levels, the temperature is the most important factor in this experiment.
It's better than no proposal!
What is he talking about?
I haven't seen Tom in a while.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
What floor does Tom live on?
There's no direct flights to Bologna.
I live outside the city.
Give me a few hours.
Don't make yourself eat if you don't want to.
I have an errand for Tom.
"How did the accident happen?" "No one knows."
What do you like about him?
When I got to the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.
Tom was relieved of his foreign accent.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
No one disagreed.
She's running.
It's a man.
If Icelandic was in color, I think he'd be white.
Do you know where the meeting will be?
I'd like them to be happy.
I want to ask you back from work.
Christians have many followers.
The carpets absorb sound.
Tom told me it was impossible.
That must be the place Tom lives.
Tom is a weird kid.
The phone was invented by Bell in 1876.
I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you work a lot.
I love the Ural languages.
I hope you're wrong about this.
Sometimes it is necessary to speak the truth.
Tom's a Nazirite.
I have an offer for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning on getting married on October 20th.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
He's got lots of talents.
He's in a bad mood.
How would you like to be called?
He's got a Japanese father.
Who would want to kill him?
I'm in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was tired.
He's a student until late at night.
Tom's room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
My girlfriend smiled at me.
This song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We have shown them that we can.
I'm proud of him.
I only got home.
Tom burns in his oven both wood and coal.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We have to be prepared.
What was his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left his keys to Mary.
I've been talking to him all the time.
I can't help laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foreshadowed the uniting of Christ’s Kingdom rule and priesthood in Jesus.
You want me to talk to Tom?
Each of us went home.
It's thin, but strong, and it doesn't move.
It's just a little silly.
At this point, I don't know what I want.
It's unbelievable.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six or five for TV viewers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really so bad?
Tell me, please, where you'll live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I wasn't beautiful.
Do you cry a lot?
We did not expect such results.
I've read it before.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Found something interesting?
Everyone's doing it.
I often visit relatives.
He'll be expelled from our club.
You should be punished for what you did.
They went up the stairs.
She has to drink water.
It's one of the most ugly buildings I've ever seen.
The vulture broke into the post office in the middle of the day.
That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God’s help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My desk's old.
We're both very busy.
That one's unsupervised.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet with me?
I'll come get you.
Tom tried to drown in the bathtub.
Tom and I are the same.
I said good-bye.
Tom is Maria's younger brother.
You act like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
There's a big book.
Don't talk about Tom.
I kind of made myself clear.
We've been waiting three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Time can change, but human nature is the same.
Tom looks too upset.
I brought some cookies.
Next year Tom will teach French.
I listened to her through the rest of her life.
I told him to rest.
Why are you angry with that?
The worst part of the trip is already behind us.
We'll miss you both.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
Don't you speak French?
How dare you do that!
I really needed that knife.
How do you know what I've had?
You'll only have a minute of this.
That's the situation I'd really like to change.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to believe any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a squirrel in a wheel.
He never survived.
Do you want to come with us?
Tom can swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We're going to leave as soon as possible.
He's gone skiing Hokkaido.
"Stay your fucking music and read your book." "I see, my censorship spell still works!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did it without you.
You're bleeding out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same as you.
We cannot just ignore that.
Where did you meet Tom?
Where's the supermarket around here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're lying, join us.
Tom wanted to ask Mary to forgive me again.
Tom was thinking.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been.
I really wish I could come with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't gonna do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Let's hurry up, or we'll be late in school.
Did you ever write a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary switched places.
How do they carry you out?
Where are you going to live?
I'm a man of peace, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is under threat.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
That decision was hard to make.
I thought you wanted a drink.
I got what you asked.
He said he'd do it.
So you didn't have to go.
Mary got better after the illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get that?
Eating meat harms your health and environment.
You tell me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to shut up for me.
Nobody loves me.
Too bad I don't know Tom's phone.
You told him?" "No, he knew everything."
Your explanation was very clear.
I went over the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you just thought about something.
Sahara is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like the most about Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to begin.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We need a lot of stuff to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is crying.
I don't have that book.
I see no difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is in the center of the solar system.
You're a cop?
Tom let both of me down, and of Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut my brittle.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river has watered the garden.
The strong wind is still at night.
Ants and giraffes are extended relatives.
Tom did it because I told him so.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom carried two suitcases.
Tom, I don't seem to know.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to going to bed early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious pear I ever ate.
I had a parking problem.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do this.
She's not mine.
You know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom never was late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each letter.
It's hard for you to take it seriously.
Members of the tribe settled along the river.
I'll start it.
I said let them go.
When did it start?
No one cares before she thinks.
I don't think it's weird at all.
"Where do you get my phone?" "Tom gave it."
When will you clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does it make sense?
Why are you shutting the door?
Tom said he tried it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at 8 a.m.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's not tall, but strong.
It's cool this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Find it, please, Tom.
He'll give it to you.
The proposal is not clearly written.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
Don't you know what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is incomplete!
This box weighs a ton.
He's getting it all because he's grumpy.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It seemed like he was going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
I don't think that's gonna happen.
I'll do it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
I've been out all day yesterday, and today I work.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose your patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a horrible man!
Carter's running a paper.
Don't be angry with him.
You're out of your power.
The curse was destroyed.
The great-grandfather of Tom was born blind.
Tom's taller than you, isn't he?
She hurt her back by playing tennis.
Tom is easily scared.
This table is white.
It was a weird game.
I've heard of all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going to Boston with you.
Let me talk to Tom.
In the past summer, they traveled to the mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the next church is?
Stay out of there.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What do you expect Tom to do?
She seemed completely calm.
Click on the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what's going on.
Mary carried boots to her knee.
That's a lie.
I'll keep an eye on them.
She said she had a cold.
The traffic inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to follow his father's footsteps.
I don't see any problem here.
I don't need to do this tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's terribly bitter.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Last time Tom was first.
Everything's different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Get the tree over there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom's gonna fix it.
Tom said good-bye to his sister.
Mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Little pots have long arms.
Tom was in a sandwich.
There's a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How's my story for you?
Tom shut off the alarm and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tireder.
I heard you singing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom often plays guitar.
I tried to warn Tom.
The train was filled.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he doesn't plan to go.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
Tom's got a cable?
Whatever you say, I'm not changing my mind.
Tom may speak.
Thank him for his help.
Tom could have told me.
It's going to make your family miserable.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I had to go.
I have to win.
It is futile to ask for his help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You need to stay awake.
Mom helps me a lot.
Tom has a snake on his back.
Did you buy meat at the supermarket?
He hit me on a mistake.
What's the name of this dog?
Come to the sidewalk.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's father is.
It's raining like a bucket.
The whole country is talking about it.
I can't wait to tell him.

We think so, too.
How could something like that happen?

I forgot to ask.
My arms and legs will always melt.
How do I translate words that are not in any language other than mine?
Can you tie that with the tape?
I'm going home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.

You went to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you talk it out?
I've already been to Sapproe.
I told you to get out of here.
We will do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom will be late for the plane.
She always gets up early.
You want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were at the very depths of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When do we have a female president?
He came hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.
It's my cookie for you.
England is like Japan in many respects.

I suggest you try harder.
Lye's not scared, nor is the child.
Don't resist.

It's a fake.
Tom is very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What's going on with Tom?
I hope you don't get cold.
He aimed at the bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Oh, come on!
I have to go further.
She was putting her nose on the glass.
In English the sayings ser and estar are not different.
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secretive.
You have excellent English.
Do you have any messages for me?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing an SMS while driving a car is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The cinnamon was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
You asked Thomas to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he has to explain it to me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We'll have some guests tonight.
Her voice will still be in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
It's time to take care of everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All the men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't let it happen.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I told him you came to Australia.
Did you look for that?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where do I have to wait for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?

The book's on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What do we lose?
You better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She never replied to his letter.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop fooling around!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm down the stairs.
It's the world's biggest car.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Can't you introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told her that Mary had to do it.
You two idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How much time did you have for this?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's head.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was screaming.
Which one's the best?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell him to leave.
What do your parents want at Christmas?
The train's going to three at thirty.
I know you're hiding something.
Free the beast from the cage.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like a father.
George is five years older than I am.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you were told.
Please, take a look at this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't be in love with your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're much higher than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on his birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
Thomas pushed away from the door.

We have to help.
Tom just got out of jail.
Did you tell Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think of it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've developed a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know what you'd do for me.
I can't believe Tom did it all.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can the vicious circle be used in evidence and be commended for it.
I can't afford to have children.
When I turned to them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and they couldn't get these fools to understand their own language.

She really did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
My mother must be angry.
White bread, please.
Shame's cute.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom still has no job.
We're perfectly compatible.
French complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger has been over.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was angry.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Is Paris far away?
How much time is it in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it'll snow this year for Christmas?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you until you pay me just as well.
I'd like some coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth since.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have that second chance.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All the bills have to pay me.
She's sick.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom gets Mary by the hair.
Tom didn't show me happiness.
When I grow up, I want to be a firefighter.
Tom eats sushi regularly with his mother.
We forgot to record!
Tom said he liked it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the lazy one I know.
Is Mary out of her room yet?
This time, I'm gonna forgive him.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a gravitator.
Alvaro of Venezuela, he's a Venezuelan.
Here's the bill.

Magnetics are used in induction plates for direct heating of kastrals and pans.
I burst into tears.
Tom wants to learn to play trombo.
Get out of here now.
Can I see your rights?
I'll take 1,000 pesetas to replace the lightning on those jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I certainly didn't know where to start.
That's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I got two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom's blonde.
He produced some letters from his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in the pajama?
How much is it worth?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to look after the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left a note for Tom.
You're a Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom from half a third.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Did someone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played the sunflower.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
The infection is in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a gift.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me.
Tom sometimes watches TV.
Am I ready?
I was waiting for you.
I still don't think so well.
Run, chickens!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I just fell asleep after two o'clock in the morning.
Maria was not greedy.
So it wasn't that hard to get to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom.
They say that that movie's very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late for the heavy rain.
Apparently she's healthy.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Watch your brother.
Tom said he wasn't gonna wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter peppers.
How long do you usually stand on Saturday?
I added milk to coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I've never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
The poor don't win.
Tom's winning.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're stuck.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you die?
Tom knows French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are nearly the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to walk.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to a beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defence.
How does faith differ from trust?
Tom put the newspaper on the table.
What did you find out?
If we allow the weather, we'll be at the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both met him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I pondered the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His gray eyes glistened and opened, and his usually pale face came alive and covered itself with a Romanian.
What kind of pizza do you love most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands fell asleep from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed many homes.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me get your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you wearing my shoes?
Power in Tom's hands.
I learned to do and play as my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
Nobody's gonna blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play more than to learn.
He was received as his little brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone's telling me I look like my dad.
Guess what language I'm talking about.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why do you call?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of a fight.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Come on!
Do it before it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to such a job.
Bring your wife.
Sussie, you're suddenly in fashion?
Tom said he didn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born the day before.
Tom has a pirated suit.
It's pure truth!
Let's get a yellow one.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
The job is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom needs to be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out of here.
We are proud of our achievement.
So I should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
You're ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not her girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sing every day.
She became an e-mail.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop hitting the cat!
What are you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know that this person is the one he gives himself up for?
King Harold Hormsson, better known as Harold Synzoub, introduced Christianity in Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay a little longer.
Almost all were dead.
You gotta get up early.
Nothing wrong happened.
The last days were very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that Tom never saw Mary.
You can't be in this room.
Have you had any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Hermann Hesse.
To be honest, I've never spoken Portuguese.
When criminal cases are brought to trial, it is common for the jury to have twelve persons in the court.
What exactly did Tom do at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I are dating.
The boys were marching four by one.
Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
It's really sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized that something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was gonna do it.
That's another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was severely damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We are impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, hurry up, we'll be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom's playing trombon.
You from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably can't do this.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds is world famous for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a very expensive present.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these spirits?
The lock's broken.
Diamond is a precious rock.
Enjoy the cookie, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I've got three French English dictionaries.
Take it off, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How'd you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waitress.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from a lack of self - control?
Was it too easy?
What Alice encountered, awaiting an answer, was a sudden warrior, and it was a loud noise, so sharp as to break her eardrums, and so loud that she could reach the sky.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he came into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
That's why you can't go in there.
Tom helped Mary take things to the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom and reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We have to hire him.
I was trying to solve the problem in vain.
You were supposed to do your homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That stone was so heavy I couldn't lift it.
Why didn't Tom sleep?
Just like it's gonna be done.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
Rich people sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your name.
A monkey climbed into a tree.
The language I learn is very complex.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
You're really alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom's my youngest.
Welcome to the Real World!
We'd like to ask you some questions.
I strongly believe in his innocence.
The President reigns for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Couldn't you find a solution?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why would you do that?
Twenty floors.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You don't know when Tom comes back, do you?
I don't have Tom's picture.
Can you wait a little longer?
You're gonna give him something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then he would have been a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
A strong wind has risen.
Tom had no courage to try and jump with a umbrella.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Do you feel okay?
He's as stubborn as he is.
I think we can count on you.
She knew she was wrong.
It's so cool!
Tom had a feeling Mary would bring her new boyfriend to a party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom used to talk in a dream last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but I got a girl.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she would win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell him you called.
Tom is very strict about the kids.
How's the negotiation going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I'm mixing mayone with the ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got little wacks.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of scattered.
Don't hurt her.
I'd rather stay.
So I came up with a brilliant idea.
She's on her own right now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place a good place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who did you talk to?
I want to believe it's all right.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I'm guessing that's why we should go to Boston next week.
Don't walk in a strange land.
Tom was terrified.
Tom's face brightened.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
His hunger was an abstract concept; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rat?
What time do you want to leave?
She had legs.
It's a risk that we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We have to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't often do that.
I hope we won't do it again.
How many times did you help him do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, there'll be opening time.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We're going as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas left the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
We wept with him.
Do you want to try again?
Wait a little longer.
What the fuck are you doing?
You can make butter, cheese, and a lot of other things out of milk.
You don't have the authority to do this.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you a relative to her?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her younger daughter.
Be nice.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an unnamed visitor.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, just as they expected.
He flicked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
You didn't think of asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one's getting hungry except for me.
Tom's really excited.
No snowflakes in the snowball don't think they're guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French?
I'll deal with this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When will the store be opened?
Don't worry. I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.

You won't need it.
Tom rarely attends parties.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're coming.
Do I look like a guy who wants to marry?

Will we help them?
Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so harsh with me.
Now I'm in charge of the parade!
People who are good for us all year.
I don't feel sorry for you.
I know Tom won't give up.
I don't really like her.
He's not here.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning on getting married on October 20th.
She thought I'd let her down.
Now I live in Boston.
Tom took his secret with him to his grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anyone else wants to do that.

You must like me very much.
What are you worried about?
I'll never do it again.

What do you think?
Let's have breakfast soon.

So we should go with Mary.
I wonder what Tom's doing here.
You can't do it.
I don't think I can go faster.
Tom's got some questions.
Are you looking for anyone?
Tom's arm bit the wall.
So you didn't have to hide.

Are you in trouble with your car?
At the tourist information centre, the map was distributed to all those who wanted it.

I tried my best.
That's a good sign.
Some are convinced that they are protected by the guardian angel.
Tom ruined his bank account.
She's at the hotel right now.
What's going to happen to me?
He was so interested that he gave it his attention.
I told him I wasn't interested.

We're both here for the same reason.
Love is strong, and money is stronger.
I saw him naked.
There are lots of children's books in our library.
I didn't let her go home early.

When will this end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
The sign spot still left a mark on the soup.

When you came back, I was gone.
Did you talk to him today?

This mountain is covered in snow for a year.
Tom stayed at Mary's store to buy sugar.
I like being a redhead.
Stay out of here.
What was the worst movie you saw in your life?
I thought you hated us.
Think carefully before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.

His name is not, in fact, Tom Jackson.
Is that sarcastic?
Don't do anything you regret.
Are you jealous of her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payment will be paid on the basis of experience and education.
I think Tom's right.

I thought I wouldn't stay.
We look forward to you and your family.
You changed it?
I told you I changed my mind.
Why did you say that?
You must work hard if you want to succeed.
There's no exception in the Esperanto.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home early tonight?
You wouldn't survive for anything.
Tom didn't think Mary would upset it.
There's a shopping area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
That's interesting news.
Tom's a bitter drunk.
We don't even know her.
Tom made some suggestions and checked them for Mary before he hit Tatobal.
I know where you're hiding your money.
At last, the school is out.
It's a long pencil.
Does your mother know about this?
Do you really like this kind of food?

I told them not to tell anyone.
That's how Tom died.
The pot's empty.
Write with a pencil, please.
We can't leave.
He confessed to his crime.
This is the most beautiful painting I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
He's worried about something.
At times, Claudia thought of psychoanalysis.
Tom would never agree to that.

He'll be back late, too.
She's very proud of herself.
I left about half a third.
Don't leave the tape in the sun.

Can I open the curtain?
You had no right to do that.
I'm yours.

Tom's making breakfast.
Come in.
I can take them for my grandchildren.
I heard Carol and Will broke up.
What do you think of Tom?
Tom says he never did.

He often spends hours reading books.
I had no idea you could do it.
Tom unloaded the car.
Tom knew something about Mary that John didn't know.
No answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I had a bad shot in my head.
Tom, you're being called.
You promised you wouldn't drink tonight.
You ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Come see what Tom is doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd come back.
When are you coming tomorrow?
The box with openings.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Is that a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I should know.
You can't make me marry you.
That's pretty weird.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up, but she didn't.
We have plenty of food today.
He delivered a speech in which he supported my point of view.

Why didn't you just tell them?
I can't rule it out.

Take a seat, please.
Wake Tom.
Here's the map.
You should have stayed with us.
Let's say we're alien.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
I have nothing to say to you.
I'd rather you don't tell Tom about it.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I'm not gonna complain.
They kept their love secret.
She hurried to the train only to delay the train.
Don't say that to my bride.
Tom's tired of always paying the bill when they and Mary go out on a date.
I urge you to reconsider your decision.
I'm not worried about your past.
The police searched Tom's car.
Even though I felt it was weird, I didn't know it was.
Are you a pig?
I went to the army.
Why can't you take me for who I am?
Bear's black.
Tom never knows what Mary did.
I don't know who's gonna be in the meeting.
It's hard for the President to come.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was terribly scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of this right now.
I don't trust her.
Six times three is eighteen.
Skala is an anagram of rookie.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan took part in a rally against racism.
You did it fast.
I need to give you two minutes to go.
He's on her side.
I have not forgotten your betrayal.

This is the place where she worked as secretary.
They're not that bad.
I thought I had everything.
Don't worry, it's gonna be okay.
I'm having a hard time working with Tom.
I'm competitive.

It's for my friend.

That's not true.
You're not allowed to do this anymore.
On summer holidays in Carouidsawaw, tourists were urged.

I'll never forget her and me going to Hawaii.
No one heard the call.

I can't go on Saturday.
We're getting married in October.

We'll see you soon.
Let's get out of here.
He's not gonna find any keys.
Her manner of speaking makes me nervous.
Eat how much you like.
And then what happened?
You think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do it.
He prefers not to talk about it.
I let them sleep until noon.
I just wanted to get back to my old life.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I already told you everything you have to know about it.
Health gives man freedom, which most don't realize until she's lost.
Is it important?

It's not surprising.
The hare's bleeding from the ear.
Postmocratic is different from modernism.
I've already read that book.
Damn it!
He's showing great enthusiasm.
Maybe you should call the police.
Did you report it to the police?
You really think Tom's sick?
I'm not afraid of that at all.
I don't have as much money as you think.
I sell clothes on the Internet.
I could do things faster when I was younger.

There were weird rumours about them.
It's unbelievable.
The sky is covered with clouds.
This bird is at risk of extinction.
You've been very happy with her.
How are you?
Tom was not the same as he was having fun.
I'm all on my throat.
You said it was important.
He said he'd be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Cock.
I don't want to.
It's time to make the kids sleep.
This work can be caught up in the future.
I'm going to get some rest.
Tom won't mind.
Nothing.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the cure?
Many people believe that our officials are corrupt.
Did he blow off his pants?
I can't distinguish him from my brother.
We can count on him.
I'll go with her.

"That's why she's getting married." "And who's the lucky woman?"
I've been thinking about you all day.
That's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I impressed him.
The train's about two minutes out on this station.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
What do you think is the best place to be safe?
I know your father.
I heard you screaming.
He's the boy who painted this painting.
"Call up" means telephone.
Who would have noticed?
Medical treatment should be used only on the instructions of a doctor.

You never wanted to talk about it.
We hope for the best.
I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
Last night the temperature fell below zero.
"You can't wear it." "Why not?"
Tom didn't do it well.
I knew Tom was not in Australia.
My eyes are the ocean that reflects my dreams.
In a big city like Tokyo, I prefer to walk rather than drive.
As it turned out here, you can't know now.
Tom's own room now.
I didn't know her first.
Many of the votes were fabricated.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you right now.

I know it for sure.
Be an adult, Tom.

It's just not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What kind of colors do you like?
She says she feels very tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know what Iraq is different from Iran.
So they told me not to.
Two days ago, I picked up a cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have a drink in that coffee cafe or something.
You got something in your pockets, didn't you?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
I saw that helicopter myself and decided to wave with my hands.
I'm with you.
You want to end up like him?
I've been thinking about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no air conditioning in my house.
Tom and Mary study French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his offer.
I admire your courage.
Tom hoped Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do it again.
Soon your turn, Bashar!
You're free.
It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
I went to Boston.
I'm sorry, could you please repeat that?
What do you think they're gonna do with Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary does it.
I don't want that.
Tom will work this weekend.
Tell her, please, I'm calling.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you and Tom.
The President's attempts to impose more strict control over the weapons were once again prevented by influential weapons lobbys.
I think we know each other.

Don't bother Tom.
I'll try to say that in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You have enough time.
We had to plan more carefully.
You should sleep.
I'm proud that my father is a good cook.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
Thomas tried to explain the situation of Mache.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one paid attention to me.
So at that time there were thirteen.
I'm going to Boston on the bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay for it.
You got coffee?
You could've told the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Find yourself a decent suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're more than Spartacus!
That's how he did it.
Why did he need Tom?
It's capital investment.
Really bitter.
Time's short on it.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try being there on Monday.
I've read this before.
Thanks to you.
As long as certain conditions are met.
She's not like everybody.
Social networks are able to find a lot of information about a person before they meet him.
What really happened last weekend in Boston?
What's the point of learning?
These peachs are not very sweet.
I don't think you can get those black stains out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay.
I can't forgive his lazy.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm realistic.
I heard Tom was expelled from school.

You can't always win.
Tom's kind of a famous one.
Jimmy knows all about cars.
I saw them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting's hanging on the wall.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom's with you?
The boy's afraid of the dark.
I made that dinner.
Russia has become the second superpower.
I'm worried about them too.
He went to the post office to send me a letter.
See that powder in a cup of water.
Are you coming with her?
Let's take one of those ready-made lunches sold at the station.
Tom was trying to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in position.
How come you know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop the guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent for the Manhattan apartment is about four thousand dollars a month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only survivor.
Are you going to buy this car?
You sound like my grandmother.
I don't have brothers.
Let's see something else.
You think it's an accurate translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted to eat.
That's why there's nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock on your hand's door.
You must take his age into account.
I forgot to say something to her.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back?
If you're tired, sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I have to move on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going for lunch on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
Would you turn off the radio?
I certainly don't remember what Tom said.
Tom is a sophisticated player.
I wasn't ready for this.
Look at that girl.
Tom has a living imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you talking about?
Yesterday you left the bar just as I was going to put all the drinks at my expense.
Tom told me it was real working.
I want to play chess.
I support you by 100%.
I haven't seen you for nearly three years.
You should tell her how you feel.
I have a slight headache.
I heard what happened.
We rarely get snow here.
Don't open that box.
I hate waiting.
I sometimes see him at the club.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
It was fun yesterday.
Where did Tom get these pictures?
It's useless to panic.
Hey, you know what?
I stayed in Boston for three days.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom knocked him off his leg.
Tom tried to prevent Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to do more.
Only you can manage your money.
How does one relate to another?
I was able to do it much faster than Tom.
Don't feed the trolls.
Where's Tom sleeping?
I won't tell you.
Why are you still here?
The equator divides the earth into two hemispheres.
He's a landman.
I've never seen anything like it.
Trees give shadow.

It's a good magazine.
Her clothes attracted a lot of attention at the party.
They're getting married tomorrow.
She was right and he was wrong.
They've drawn lots of lots to go first.

Tom put the toys in the toy box.
I don't want you to drive.
He said he was coming.
"Doctor, everybody ignores me." "Serious!"
He's got one thing in his life to make money.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.

What are you doing in my room?
We miss him so much.
He answered his parents.
Tom, are you eating already?
Who'd you give it to?
I held him for the collar.
Nobody invites you to do this.
I forgot it was April one this morning.
Please stop singing that song!
Tom bit a dog.
I know you left early.
Tom did it all morning.
I understand the consequences.
On the eastern and western sides of the city, the river divides.
Why are you jumping?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
That's why it was scary?
Tom invited me to stay for the night.
I don't think Tom was guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do it.
If the ice warms, it melts.
We could have done it.
The doctor said he needed surgery.
I recently changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom is real.
Who's knocking on the door to me?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I came to see you.
I feel amoeba.
Our team went home with a triumph.
I'm going alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I listened to him.
Why don't you sleep?
Did he come to you with a warranty?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do it!
Everyone's silent.
Let the dust lie down.
Why are you so stubborn?
He entered his Chinese teacher's school, but with all of these hormonal cases, he entered almost every meeting.
I'm happy to let you know that I've recovered completely.
I've written a lot of suggestions for the Esperanto.
I like it more than a shepherd.
I can't make an exception.
He's quick to think about it.
I can find them.
I'm right here.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I have my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't pay the bill.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My dad likes fishing like I do.
Hey, it's me.
Dan showed himself a supporter of the superiority of the white race.
I'll try to distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom says French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom better cook than I do.
He swims like an ax.
Tom didn't tell Mary he needed to buy.
She brought meth.
"Tom, hurry." "I'm coming!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'll try to say that in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to brag about his father's successful car business.
She's in sunglasses.
Come on, Emily, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of the computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Negative times minus gives a plus.
In the basement of the body.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to tell.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the dorm room.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're cool.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane's farewell speech really upset us.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look smart.
I appreciate your help.
He couldn't hold his smile.
Wait, did you say girl or boyfriend?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is the knowledge that you didn't even know you didn't.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should've thought better before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he's not marrying Mary.
I got two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's gone.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come, too?
Does Tom earn enough to live in a city?
The interrogation's over.
Please turn off the radio.
It seemed he was not sure of his answers.
I heard rumours about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if it's warm.
There are so many of them.
He could not compromise his principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
You probably have three hours to go for this.
That was an easy solution.
Mary said she'd be early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
You still buying lottery tickets?
That could be anybody.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was a Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom has a rich imagination.
Lastly, she had solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I had nothing wrong with my thoughts.
Tom keeps his room clean.
The three books belong to Tom.
He jumped from one topic to the next.
It's a Truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom goes inside.
It's not cold today.
I mistakenly put Tom's shirt on.
It seems that the bank robbery was planned down to small things.
So he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Stay a little longer.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank's empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I bathed in the river.
Tell them to take the phone off.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, right?
Don't force me to kill you!
Which one do you like better?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't hurt us.
You may not answer.
Tom's got lots of books.
Can you tell the difference between an alligator and a crocodile?
Wait, is that what?
My grandfather built this house.
Do you want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
You really want me to tell him you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
The whole people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous this is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
All right, listen up, please.
Is it made from wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom is my friend.
Considering to remain a ignorant and free nation, the nation looks forward to what never happened and will never be.
Tom's barely breathing.
Dogs don't get any different colors.
Tom poured water out of a bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are right animals.
Tom's house was practically destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
There are two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna give you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than a bad company.
That's not the right data.
There is a marked difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
We have to tell him that he doesn't do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's making a view.
Come closer.
We stopped at the Hillton Hotel.
So it's good to tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She was always complaining that she didn't have any money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something to do.
She gave him a gift.
Mary's in his room.
All attention!
That very second I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order that pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom's my close friend.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't have been alone in the woods.
No one sees my tears.
Tom disappeared again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are full of bottles.
Tom never kissed anyone.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'm listening.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very happy to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last autumn.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everybody knows we didn't.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five.
We complained to the noise manager in the neighbours.
I won't let you do that.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need that.
Honesty is one of the virtuous.
If you meet him for a new year, you'll get him through.
There's no books in the library in French.
Any generalization is dangerous, especially that.
You could stay in Boston.
There's nobody there.
Can you write that shit, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you the way I do.
Show yourself age accordingly.
You know how to holgle?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they wouldn't come.
I don't wear animal suffering.
I think Tatobé's slowing down today.
Sally made her brother clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment is full of mess.
Conference room is in the middle of the day.
Potato chips are harmful to your health.
She's not as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's huddled here.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom.
Get the rope!
You said it so many times yourself.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been that way.
Can't we fire her?
The art satellite was placed in orbit.
I'm completely serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too easy.
What happens to our children if a nuclear war begins?
I told them the bank didn't work.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry about Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
Tom didn't tell us what he was upset about.
I knew it was him.
Tom works.
I don't work today.
You said that last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew this was something.
There's nothing to hide, isn't there?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The bill should be paid as of the first number of the following month.
My French terrible.
We need help.
You're afraid of her.
To me, Boston is a cold town, not like Chicago.
Tom was a victim of attempted extortion.
I can't speak for my colleagues.
Is Tom living far from you?
Why didn't I die?
The squawk was over with a fight.
I didn't take him, you can check his pockets.
Tom came yesterday.
I'd like to leave a note.
You chose the wrong man.
They took a great risk.
We have a white cat.
Perhaps you can never walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home last night?
If anyone can do it, then Tom.
The meeting was canceled because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
A ride with the mulama was on the road.
Tom speaks French to his grandparents, and English to his parents.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom was hard to find.
It's all dancing!
I live with Tom.
This is where I met them.
You don't lose your time.
Your problem is you don't have enough patience.
Several events marked the beginning of the twenty-first century.
Stop doing that, Tom.
Tom said he didn't plan on doing it.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to go to Australia.
I think you could do it.
Tom said there was no question about it.
He got out of bed.
The trains are on schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think that it is impossible not to get confused in languages.
Why am Tom avoiding me?
Is the exam gonna be today?
What motivates you?
You gave Leila your computer yourself.
Roll up your sleeve.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America could be president, but maybe they don't.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom's name.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
How long is the train arriving?
How long does this train get to Boston?
Didn't you see that?
I need you to call me.
Tom never suspected Mary and John were dating each other.
When I'm rich, I'll buy a farm.
I made him cookies.
It's a neighbouring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come last night?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to reflect.
Get this to French, please.
Get the cold back!
She needs a cab.
The crowd grew rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me what happened.
Cosi and fuck.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She's in love with everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's answers.
Tom's got a weak heart.
So I'll have to pay for her.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his overhead beard.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
No one saw you take that.
I'm half of Japan.
Tom says he'll fix her.
You have to go back.
We've already spoken.
I can't believe I finally managed to do this.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
The test is easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know which book to pick.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
It's a tower.
I have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Is anyone here dating them?
They're watching you.
How long do you need?
I think Tom remembers me.
We can do this.
He knows his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's wearing a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There are many great avenues in this city.
What are you doing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't force people to do this.
Let me get that.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I hate that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's not married yet.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
Our neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never spoke to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She's got some flaws.
I wonder why it's necessary.
It seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom's not the only one in Boston.
Will you back me up?
Why don't you like the plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
A friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter will be over soon.
The titles and rewards don't matter to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting's prolonged.
I'll find out.
Did you have a good day off?
Tom's drinking beer.
Don't do it. Don't do it.
Tom had a good job.
Is it good or not?
Don't you remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring Tom to drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Gather up!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we'll get lost.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude conduct.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks like an optimist.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I'll connect you to her.
She's got the highest grades.
Tom might get up there.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color is your childhood associated with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the benefit of society.
There are some people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom used a jackmaster.
I'd like to lie down.
Give me the notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight, and I don't want to leave home.
He'll be here today.
Cat's dead.
It's only half nine now?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
There's no safe swimming in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me tonight.
Tom doesn't look good.
She put herself on her hands to warm them.
Tom said he was glad you'd come back.
My car is covered with blue shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Is Laurie home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not going to make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I told her to marry him.
I've been waiting my whole life this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane entered the airship.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any correspondence friends in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary fainted.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come to the concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to see you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your probes?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read that book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hi," said Tom earnestly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how long it takes.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price guy.
You don't need to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new offer as a message in a bottle, one day they'll be moved.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
We're family souls with him.
I have a grandson of your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started being developed in her new office.
Let us take care of it.
I believe you're sitting in my shoes.
I was planning on doing this yesterday.
It's a little early for drinking alcohol, isn't it?
My parents don't like my manner of dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him with a trap and a great deal.
Is it worse?
It's not cheap.
Can I have your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut a cake?
Tom didn't lie all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about kissing.
The series has to start watching when all the seasons have been set aside!
Road accidents occur daily.
Where did you go on the ski?
You were at the barber's place?
The outlook is frustrating.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me a ball pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to Tom.
I haven't slept two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Get lost.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture together.
I failed my exam.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
Are they coming, too?
She's sleeping like a baby.
Tom forgot to let go of the brakes.
This song reminds me of one girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The whole building was shaken by an explosion.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged him.
It's my cat.
Do you have any children yet?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a presumptuous idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I suppose you need some help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all panties.
Tom thinks it's a sin to throw out the food.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place is going to bend to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it at all.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved considerably.
Let's go to church.
Tom rubbed out the whiskey.
Was it heavy?
He's responding.
I didn't see him sweeter.
How much was he worth?
I need to see you right now.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.
Do you know the boy who cries?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do it.
He'll steal a cow's ass.
Tom doesn't swim very well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was nothing but a shadow of himself.
How do we do it?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Everything's happening.
What day is it?
Let's give them another chance.
I just want you to take me who I am.
I'm a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily in her lips?
Why don't you go in there?
Tom didn't say he was coming with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I have to stay together.
I only heard about him good.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't be like us.
I saw the car explode.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's on fire!
I'm afraid you're gonna lose it.
I love going to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank you for your son from me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't help it.
Tell him I'm gonna come to his house tonight.
They need you.
It's orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer in charge of his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm going to try things like that right now.
I don't really know hunting.
It's the first time I've been cooking meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to pay.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I knew it already.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was sceptic.
Tom must be home.
She was the one I thought about.
Tom showed the cop his driver's license.
I'm jumping up every month.
I told you I didn't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an apple of sour.
The number of tickets has been limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go, too.
You're taking the job at the house?
According to mythology, Prometheus stole a sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All the passengers managed to get out of the bus before it lit up.
I want to help you figure it out.
You speak French better than I do.
There are a lot of talented people in this town, but Tom doesn't belong to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars were dead in the night sky.
I doubt Tom's gonna win.
"Hey, you're so boring here." "My little boy, we're looking to this world... "" "I'm your Majesty, Hanon and his attendants took the island of Corida" "" "Hm. How can we... "it's written, "it's just Link can get off to Hanon." "So we can. "I'm gonna take my sword!" "I'm gonna take my sword!"
Do you know who sings this song?
Is your watch coming right?
I'll see you on Sunday at three.
I was at your wedding.
Tom barely knows how to swim.
You're good at this.
I met her on the way home from school.
I didn't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn to read.
I'm heading to Tom's house.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed money.
Tom helped Mary lay the blanket.
A - Many consisting of elements c, b and a
I'll be back by nine.
He's got diabetes.
We can deal with them.
I just wondered if you had any experience you'd like to share with us.
Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What music are you listening to in the car?
I was told three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French revolution began during Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
I want to bathe in the sea.
It'll be entirely dependent on him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our town was accompanied.
No one saw them leave the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We were talking about you.
Which music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, no food.
It'll be snow tomorrow.
You should've quit smoking a long time.
Stop joking!
Some of my classmates are full of nubs, they don't know anything about computers.
Did you like your bicycle?
I thought Tom wasn't sleeping.
So they were not allowed to leave.
I didn't find them right away.
Hurry up, please, Tom's waiting.
Listen to what the teacher says.
She looks amazingly like Marilyn Monroe.
I know who we can turn to for help.
I'm stronger than you are.
She felt deep regret as she looked back on life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.

I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all children.
She got out and yelled at me.
Did you take your medicine?
The hares are very cute.
She doesn't trust him.
Time is on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there anything you want to say to me?
I doubt Tom is still angry.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell the hot rubber?
That wasn't what happened here.
When is your father coming home?
I understand.
Tom pulled out Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my heart.
Tom's got a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's trying to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's going deaf.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair is wet.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it weighs?
The traveler is a complimentary master.
Tom's married to Mary, right?
All the benches in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I've got it all working.
Vermont is on the border with Canada.
He had to live in one room with his brother.
I didn't imbecile.
You're gonna fix it, aren't you?
I can't hunt.
He's got a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamics invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you shouldn't do this.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've been talking to this student before.
What chemical mark is methyl hydrogenic acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
So we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
It's cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a palace.
I respect his views, though I do not agree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the middle of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied his sweater.
I don't think Tom would want to go with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine times cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her not.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
How long are you planning on staying?
We were in a hurry, but we left immediately.
There's a big garden outside the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal from the soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What did she tell you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you call him at all?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right across from me.
The cap was opened.
I've brought some wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you to death.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I propose another strategy?
They're dead.
Apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
She sings?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
You understand Tom?
Let's get in the car.
You're interrupting me.
She wondered what his lips would taste.
A good coach trains this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was arrested because of the heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Are you living there?
What would you eat?
You won't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom planned to do it or not.
I'm falling.
I was unable to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new shoe.
She learned to ride a bicycle last year.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go outside.
As I was walking down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses are in your street?
The ivory fleas are made of ivory.
I'm not a child anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
Her mother tongue is French.
It's not a good coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought that book.
Violence is its only positive quality.
My Hobbies are insect collection.
Tom's baby lived in Boston.
I haven't eaten six days.
Can I tell them that?
She's been silent all day.
No matter what he might say, don't believe him.
I'm moving on.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very nice, and she's got a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under the wheelhouse.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could have known a lot about them if you had just listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
Sorry to upset you.
Those who have never left their country are filled with prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom helps his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people, cows are sacred animals in India.
I turned the imagination on.
I thought we could do it.
My mom didn't want me to drive alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't understand you that.
You know what you're doing, don't you?
The machine transfer can't be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
She and I are peers.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?
The prisoner is released.
What, they said, happened?
Could you leave the door open?
I'm gonna have to wait with that.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice as old as me.
Tom knows what was wrong about him.
In Japan the soft climate is mild.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mother finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let him do what he wanted.
He's replaced the injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip went very smoothly.
It's inevitable that I'm leaving for France one day, and I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom just pretends to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain stopped, you can open the windows again.
That's never happened to me before.
I don't think Tom was lost.
I was going out when the phone rang.
I don't have to tolerate it.
Always let go of the road to the right.
We are asked to take turns.
I'd like to ask you some more questions.
I don't like the rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a blow if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with this?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxs like a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There is an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice like a melodious siren song to me.
What is it like to be married?
I thought Tom might help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers were left on the glass.
Chemistry is a great science.
I feel like my French doesn't get much better.
How can I get a passport?
Perhaps you can help Tom.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom didn't pay attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell a house, but he doesn't have a choice.
There's still light outside.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my dad's car, but soon it'll be mine.
Have you forgotten his name?
If I had time to do it, I'd do it.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Big Thomas?
That'll help you.
Stop making noises.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how I was doing?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I can't trust anyone.
She's an admirer of "Sex in a Big City."
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Get a good look at him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do that?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
Christ for good, stop!
Nothing compares with a glass of beer after a long day’s work.
What was that?
Tom left his bag.
Here's some interesting facts.
How long will it take you?
Let's take a break here.
Are you in the new shoes?
You can leave if you like.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She fed the thunderuse when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly forbidden.
That peach is beautiful.
Can you see that?
Tom's not happy about that.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good work!
You used to say that yourself.
Here are some letters for you.
It is almost impossible for a scientist of this level to make such a basic mistake.
He doesn't have any proof.
You don't look well.
He was swimming very well when he was young.
I write pal.
He's very good at playing tennis.
She led the students astray.
She said she was a Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
When were you gonna tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I've filled a bag full of trust.
Come straight.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
Which house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What are we doing for?
Will it rain today?
We know about her.
You could've helped us.
I'm driving a car a little bit.
So I don't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just ask him to forgive me.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventure.
Tom's in the library.
You were in school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
There's going to be a big snowfall tomorrow.
We decided to postpone the meeting the following Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know Tom's name.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like the Carnival.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
Who did Tom sell his car?
Tom is a muzzle.
I have to make money to be able to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at foreigners.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your kids, would you?
So Mary and I need some rest.
He's got a good night's sleep.
It could have been worse.
Tom made his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I don't sleep much.
Someday you'll get there.
Tom's good with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you don't."
He came up and got on his knees.
You don't have to go in there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did it for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom earns three times as much as Mary.
I've been drinking milk.
It'll be snow tomorrow.
Isn't life wonderful?
When it comes to cooking, no one will compare with Mary.
You haven't been your own since.
Tom lost his leg in an attack on the shark.
I'm fucked for you.
We'll do it as time goes on.
Next year, I'll be three times as old as you.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's not much higher than Mary.
No one seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This tissue is attached to your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's all about winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided not to play a guitar.
I'm married now.
It was only a few times.
This time, you've gone too far.
It works.
Are you going to see Tom before you leave?
Tom replied.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He doesn't sing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They still haven't woken up.
Tom's a couple inches above Mary.
I'm glad you proposed that.
Your question is difficult to answer.
You don't believe her?
English is a worldwide language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary alone.
Did you not know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why do you need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
Things are getting worse.
I'm going to pick a place to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She'll split up.
I won't let you take my children.
Don't give them to him.
Run, or you'll be arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom set himself up to meditate every morning.
Did you check your calculations?
He tried to create a short story.
A room without books, like a body without a soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you for a hundred years.
I visited Tony yesterday.
It's easy for her to impress.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
Aristotle believed that the earth was the center of the universe.
I wonder what Tom really meant.
Nobody understands me.
There's so much out there, I can't reread them.
Everyone came back and looked at us.
Let me see.
A white bear lives in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask me to do anything.
Let's wash the dish tonight who loses the stone tower!
How unfortunate I am!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He's running away speaking Russian -- at least he's told me so.
Tom is a third-year-old.
Will you stay a long time?
I'm not a woman.
She's got a high father.
The train was full.
The house is red.
I think I'll start off with a bottle of beer.
You know Boston pretty well, don't you?
Orchester started playing.
Mary was in a pirate's suit.
It's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it before?
Tom didn't want to be a knocker.
He was born at seven o’clock in the morning of 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom eats only white meat.
Thank you for helping me.
We've only got three rules.
She bought herself.
The guards didn't see Tom.
In recent years Tom has been very important.
I helped move those bags.
They've got plenty of time.
Fifteen times five is seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You don't know what he'll say yet.
My hands are tired.
I lied to my wife all the time.
Finally, she succeeded.
It's a flagrant insanity that they weren't insured by the fire.
We've got a lot of money.
The examination was divided into two parts.
When are you gonna tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Uh, you're so boring here!
Reading the book is like traveling.
Tom saw Mary come into the store.
Why aren't you in there?
Tom said Mary was likely to win.
The Japanese would never do that.
I miss Boston so much.
She always writes letters.
I don't know who to consult.
Turn left to the corner.
Tom taught me to do it.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I'm not bringing out the wrong kids.
Tom bought it for me.
What you said got mad.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for thirty years.
She showed her talents.
I wish it could be.
I guess you can't do this.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
Bob's next school festival will be the first to play a major role.
You have to stay in shape.
I've been climbing seeds all day.
I realized he was American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Mercy!
Tom complied.
All the people of my generation think about it the same way.
I live for it.
You know how to ski?
The Duke owns many lands.
At least you had some fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's slowly getting fattened up.
You'll feel at home.
Good will never end!
He looked as if he hadn't eaten a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American political scientist."
Get out of here!
If it's not the sale of goods at home, then maybe it's a new way of getting to know girls?
Tom got a coin.
Why didn't you get out of your room?
If there is no God, everything is permitted.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
You're still working?
A new one?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please adjust the belts during the takeoff and landing.
That was Tom and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've been waiting a long time.
I rejected the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I'll have too much time to explain why this doesn't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I'm looking forward to a summer's leave.
Can we do this differently?
That's where he looks great.
Woodhouses are easily inflamed.
Let's run Tom's party.
The dog is still alive.
I go to university.
I know you lied.
It's a very comfortable thing to do.
I'll make a report tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a sneaker.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait for his coming here.
We talked about what we could do.
Tom doesn't know Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is José, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I eat something?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everyone's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who set up the meeting?
I'm such a lucky guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the soup.
What kind of bird can't fly?
It has to be put to an end.
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom died at seventy years of age.
Life is a gift.
Tom speaks French.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexei?
You look like a girl.
Here are some photos.
What's going on in Channel 10?
I hate spinach.
Mother's cooking.
Tom is a pilgrim.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen horrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's inclined to give his emotions a degree of free will.
We were shocked to report his death.
Why didn't they go?
I haven't seen you.
You just note the obvious.
He had cancer.
You're the one who made it happen.
He's used to watch.
I know where you're going.
You've got everything in the summer.
Let's give him a lift.
Let's leave this until tomorrow.
Tom may know more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do this.
I don't like to do this.
The cleaning woman interrupted the conversation.
On a writing table, cat.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not homing anymore.
Tom was a big smoker.
Tom put gloves on.
It's hard talking to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to this weather.
I wonder who's gonna help him paint a snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in kinship?
What's that noise?
My son's inherited illness.
It's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He put down the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is assault.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it was easier.
Can we help you with something?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
Japanese live on rice and fish.
When will you be ready to go?
The investigations began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What makes you think you can't?
We were driving back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe this?
Thank you for your correction.
Are you crazy?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's running his pencil.
Tom can't ride a bicycle.
I'm not talking at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 in one day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They didn't reach the time limit.
It's seven.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who said this to Tom.
Tom got early to see the dawn.
Dinosaurs died out a long time ago.
I usually go up steps in one pass.
Tom's been given over that year.
I'm near the station.
Tom is a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, aren't you?
Put it on my writing desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Brother Tom?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
Tonight, I'm going to get everything out of my hands.
I asked them to stay away from this.
Tom only learned to drive at thirty.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed for a long time.
The cook knife was not sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my pen-fed knife.
Honey, I can explain.
You're about to adjust to village life.
Keep a bucket of water next to you.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We made it all up.
The river is deeper than that.
Thank you from the heart.
I told you that a hundred times.
I'm really cold.
I guess you should tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing words separately when written is a big problem in the Norwegian language.
What do you do with the remains of prepared rice?
Ten years have passed since her death.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left soon thereafter.
This book should be read.
Tom and Mary made lessons before dinner.
I don't want to drink your tea.
You're always so romantic.
The wife's not a boots, you're not gonna drop off her leg.
I'll have you at six.
I teach That's French.
I love learning other languages.
Mary's got brown eyes.
I would like to know how long Tom planned to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give him a chance.
I like fruits.
Tom lied.
He's a car dealer.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I was eating eggs.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check.
Tom gave the Mary gun.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They were the first to go to the bus.
Let's wait until Monday.
Does anyone know them here?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take leave.
I'm used to smelling.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get to the point.
Tom was sitting on the steps.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes the lightning hits twice in one place.
I'm not bragging.
Leave it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door open.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
Make your own decision.
Have you been surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree that we cut down and determined that he was thirty years old.
I think I've known you all my life.
I want Tom never to write my daughter again.
The rabbits multiply fast.
I don't want to discuss it now.
What's the cost of cleaning your coat?
We'll paint it.
The opening's narrow.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness knocks on your door.
You need to listen to her.
I'd like you to know how much you mean to me.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tell me frankly.
I'll go into anything.
Do you mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I wouldn't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left the last one.
Tom signed the petition.
You were trying to talk to Tom about this?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know much about Tom.
How was your day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
Would you like them to help?
Tom can't be seen anywhere.
I told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruits.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
We can meet again in the near future.
The trees calmed me down.
He's a dragonboy.
I slept on my stomach.
Keep me posted.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she'd buy him.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two stamps for forty-five cents, please.
I'll give you a bicycle for your birthday.
Tom started to suspect something was wrong.
Beer is beer.
I don't think Tom's gonna like it.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
You kind of said it was yours.
Tom's doing his research.
