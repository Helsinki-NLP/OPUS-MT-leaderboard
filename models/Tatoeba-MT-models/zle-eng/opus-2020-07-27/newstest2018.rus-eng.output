President Vladimir Putin of Russia has signed a law establishing administrative liability for the violation of the duration and the way in which goods, construction, services are paid in the course of procurement for public and municipal needs.
This law is intended to address a very acute problem of the failure of employers to comply with their obligations in the course of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to obtain payment under already completed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Attorney General ' s Office to take over the problem for special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not deal with unfair employers who had entered into unfunded contracts, they had tried to avoid the obligations of payment and had included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the right of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has submitted 9,000 submissions, bringing 4.5 thousand officials to justice and 533 to the investigative bodies for the conduct of the proceedings, and 46 of them have initiated criminal proceedings.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
These huge amounts, however, were not saved by the failure to pay billions of contracts.
Rich debts have resulted in numerous, systematic delays in paying business fees to a much smaller amount.
This is a typical case.
The manager of a small company has won a multi-million rouble social transport competition.
The person invested all his working capital, fully complied with the obligations, but did not receive the money in due course.
The result is an increasing fiscal commuter from salary, tax, credit, which would lead to bankruptcy if the business did not seek assistance from the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The problem has now been minimized in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt owed under government and municipal contracts identified by prosecutors in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt rates continue to reach critical values, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office works in manual crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally holds field visits with local authorities, at which all violations and immediate action by prosecutors are dealt with in a substantive manner.
Such operational meetings have already taken place this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ on the introduction of amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences to establish administrative liability of ordering officials of a customer for the violation of the length of time and the way in which goods, construction, services are paid for the procurement of goods and services for the provision of public and municipal needs, which the President of Russia signed last week.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, which fines between 30,000 and 50,000 roubles for violation by an official of the order of time and for the payment of goods, works and services in State and municipal procurement.
If an official is already subject to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he or she will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to enforce these legislative innovations in practice.
The Civil Rights Unit issued a warning to move to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to colourful people traveling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The statement of the group reads: “The warning to travelers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, effective until 28 August 2017, calls on African travelers, visitors and State citizens of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to exercise greater caution in travel through the state in connection with a number of suspicious racist incidents that have recently taken place throughout the State and brought about here”.
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the fact that a movement warning team had recently adopted a law in Missouri has made it more difficult for people to win claims of discrimination and that State law enforcement agencies have disproportionately chosen minority representatives.
“You have people who are subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of their colour, beaten and killed,” said the Canisas City Star Rod Chepel, President of the National Association for the Advancement of Missouri’s Colored Population.
“We hear complaints often more than ever before.”
This is the first warning of this kind issued by the organization vis-à-vis the state of the United States.
The Group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eighth-year-old Tori Sanders, black man from Tennessee.
Saunders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year, after he ran out of gasoline during his visit to the state, and Missouri police arrested him without having been charged with a crime.
The prevention also refers to a recent report by the Public Prosecutor's Office of Missouri that the likelihood of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for whites.
“The purpose of warning people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri”, he said.
“People should be prepared in one way or another if they will take with them the money to pay the bail or inform the relatives who travel in state territory.”
According to a recent FBI programme on hate crimes, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, making the State ' s sixteenth state the number of such violations.
Warning of movement is also a response to the new State of Missouri law, after which it will be more difficult to bring a case against a legal person in relation to housing or labour discrimination.
The American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) had previously issued a warning to travelers in Texas and Arizona after the States had enacted new immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which ACLU said would have to increase racial checks.
Traffic warnings are usually issued by the Department of State in relation to other countries, but in recent times, public organizations have responded to specific laws and trends within the United States.
Two people died as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown men fired a police patrol in the Egyptian town of Isna, reporting Reuters with reference to the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
Two people, including one police officer, were killed during the shooting and three were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the vehicle, after which two armed men fired at law enforcement officers.
One of the abusers was detained and the other managed to escape.
Russia supports the law on the lifting of free luggage for non-return flights.
The Head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, in an interview with the RBC television channel, stated that “reservedly” refers to the adoption of a law on the lifting of free luggage in non-return flights.
"It is necessary to create the conditions under which a person who has no luggage may buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage," he stressed.
Mr. Safon said, however, that despite the citizen's concerns, there would be no need to pay for the carriage of the upper clothes and mobile phones in the handyard.
"It would be right to calm all of our citizens and tourists and to state it, to say it's to the top of our clothing, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the viaduct or even to some computer will not have a relationship," said the head of Rosturism.
In the past, Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law requiring airlines to exclude the provision of free luggage for non-removal flights.
It is that airlines can themselves determine the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in non-retributive tariffs.
Vladimir Putin directed that the pollution of Baikal be eliminated
President Vladimir Putin, of Russia, at the meeting on protection issues, reported that in recent years large areas of the lake had been subjected to extreme pollution.
It requested the identification of sources of funding, plans and execution for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin has also commissioned a full rectification of contaminated territories.
“We also have to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them worn out”, quotes the President's RA Novosta.
He also added that the Office of the Attorney General of Russia should conduct a review of the identification of environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with the appearance of natural landfills and a number of environmental irregularities by recreational organizers.
“I want to emphasize this: not everybody else to test, but the measure needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful, and to take appropriate measures”, he stressed.
Previously, the Office of the Attorney-General reported a decrease in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of sites subject to environmental oversight.
Remember, on 15 June Vladimir Putin, in a direct line, stated that legislation needed to be amended to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special security regime.
The residents of the island of Olhoon, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory, were informed of business problems.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergey Donski, immediately proposed a solution by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water-guard area, but in the Government of Buratia it was recalled that such a change was not sufficient, as restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, the Ministry of Economics had proposed a solution by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A New Temple Will Come In the South
In the Soiva village, members of the community of the indigenous small peoples of the North, Rakhtinya, join the people of the Berezov district in building an Orthodox temple in honor of the priest Nikolai Wondermaker.
Its location is the river bank, and the temple will be well visible from a distance, so it will serve as a guided lighthouse for fishermen.
According to community representatives, the construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now installed, and a church circle is in place.
The I.D.A. of the fleet gave the transport escort.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wondermaker because he honors the Orthodox Church as the patron of the travelers, including fishermen.
In a similar way, fishing provides work and food for settlers.
The local people are waiting for the temple to open its doors and the children are even writing about it in their school essays as local sights.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do laws are respected in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while he cleanly stores a iron box in his office.
After the interview is over, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - a hundred feet - and throws the bulls out there.
The public waste fine is US$ 500, according to Chang.
You know, since I was a kid, I've worked out that you can't leave a fountain from a candy on a bridge, you know, you can't leave a fountain on a grate.
And now I have all the cameras.
And indeed, Singapore sidewalks are clean in the center of the city, like a museum.
Chang relates that three months ago his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted a graffiti of the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced to a scaffold.
What?
Imagine that.
He received ten blows of wooden stick and spent a week in prison.
We don't have much corporal punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and improbable laws, the AIF states on the ground.
No one here thinks of abolishing the death penalty, explains counsel Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been concerned about both the EU and the US.
If a person transports a lot of drugs or sells them, he's placed a seedling.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
His defence was spoken by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
But the guy was hanged anyway.
Following that, the drug dealer has been scrambling around our country.
This is to say, in Singapore, that laws are binding on EMI, not just on modest and small people.
No matter who you are, you're a millionaire, you're a vice-premier, you're a well-known artist, or you're a resident of the European Union.
There's one option here: if you find a cocaine dump, you'll be hanged.
When you walk across Singapore and see a lot of warnings, you wonder how many bans there are in this town-state.
For example, a gem is sold only in pharmacies and can be purchased strictly by a prescription (!) of a doctor.
A visitor who does not get a jacket at his arrival, but needs to attach a scaffold in the subway, will be fined 1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white tablets on their neck, "I've lost."
In addition to a fine, we often have a week 's drive to clean parks and beaches.
6,000 roubles are paid by a “criminal” who forgets to wash the water in a public toilet, and when trying to meet a small need in an elevator home, a special detector is fired - doors are locked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws are the prohibitions on the feeding of pigeons on the street, the public performance of song, and even the excessive rainfall of room plants (!): The water spill is thought to attract mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry incinerators, or they will burn 5,000 Singaporean bucks.
Anyway, there's a thought, no matter how hard you do, you'll always get something broken.
That's not the case at all, it's trying to get me to Muhammad Kabir-Chajaria, the local traveler.
Of course, fantastic laws exist only on paper, and over the last 20 years, I've never seen anyone get involved for their violation.
Why are they preserved?
So that the citizens don't get relaxed.
The implementation of the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let's say if they sell a cigarette to a minor in a kiosk, they'll be punished on the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge sum, the perpetrator himself will get hit with sticks on the back, and the seller will pick up and be put in jail.
It is because of such harsh laws that the offence in Singapore is very rare.
Is this justified?
As early as the seventieth years, we had a highway chaos, the motorists ignored the lights, traveled as they wished, and sat down intoxicating.
After the fines a year, everything calmed down.
The driver now knows that if he stops, the police officer will not allow the bribe, he will pay the rent, and he will be sent to jail for years.
Many foreigners in the city-state in South-East Asia seem to be a concentration of concentration.
In 1993, U.S. writer William Gibson called Singapore "Divinneland With Death", a U.S. guest, brought terror to the general wealth of the inhabitants, "a scared clean airport" and "a multicultural nature".
To find out, such things are unnatural, they look artificial, and so in principle they shouldn't.
For the first days in Singapore, you are rightly afraid to throw a sandwich on the sidewalk, grab yourself when you're in the subway with the ice cream.
But then you come to the small India area, and then suddenly you have a cut of the pattern, and the bus stop contains plastic cups.
"What's that?" You're surprised.
And so, they smile at Singaporeans.
Everything's happening.
Not every such wrongdoing will be taken away in place, but you must know that if it is calculated, you will not take vengeance, for you have transgressed the law.
Most of all, it's enough for a person to behave normally.
The power in Singapore is certainly authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Hosin, I moved with great caution — motorists often snatch smartphones and cameras from tourists.
There's a lot of dirty bums and begging in the center of Paris.
Not everyone in our streets is trying to throw garbage in the urns.
Singapore, by recruiting dragon fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
You'll back up.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia no one was ever driving until they were fined.
Although the principal part of Singapore was not fines but voluntary law enforcement.
And we should think that in Russia, too, people would be happy to have clean streets, to have no garbage on the subway, and would welcome the arrest of those who have confused the elevator with the public toilet.
Body punishment, thank you, don't do it.
On the other hand, Singapore's laws at least cost to look after them.
Nothing holy?
Now Trump's White House is targeting Statue Liberty.
The surest sign of a regime change is when he starts to fight against statues.
Americans understand it no less than the rest of us, hence the planned theatre demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Government of Trump, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought a symbolic gesture over the Statuua of Liberty during a bitter dispute with the journalist CNN Jim Akosto on the President's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Be honest, Miller didn't touch the statue.
The masses of pleasureship ship owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would beat him if he tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense, and especially to the point attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when the poems Emma Lazarusus were added to the pededestal.
As Miller shouted at Akosta, "I don't want to go deep in history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom, which is a symbol of peace.
The creation you speak of has been added later and is not part of the original Article of Liberty.”
Miller correctly presented the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
It's about the current discussion of Lazarus' striking words, the only ones in which the State invites, not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your fathers, your poor, / your crowd, who dream of breathing freely, / Unluckful throws of your unsavory shores."
Never before's "dark throws" were so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature -- he made it clear that the American Trump didn't have these people waiting.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of the wider political and cultural war: it's really a debate about the meaning of America.
Lazarus, and her friends, who fought to put her words on a statue after her death, understood very well that they were committing a totally political act.
The sculpture was intended to indicate the link between the French and American republics by means of a banal classic figure, the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus had changed her meaning: she had a voice in her poems of a female figure.
And she got a very different name: the Mother of the Inscene.
The combination of poems and images was a brilliant feminist action and a destructive attack against American Nazism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right thing to do is to change it back.
Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist who took the arrival of Trump, said in 2010 that freedom invited no one; rather, it was an early neo-conservator, who had the American plume lying in the darkness of the world: " Liberty is moving forward.
It carries the United States ' freedom torch to the rest of the world.
I don't need a torch to light the way to the United States."
Against Limbo's custom, it really hit a point here.
The mind of the statue depends solely on the eye.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen by exhausted, unhappy but full of hope on the decks of a ship after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking to the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue answers them with the hopes and hospitality they want to hear.
And, of course, that's not the future Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
They need a torch, not to shine the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
2017 World Championship: Neal Blake appreciates Scottish members of Britain's collection.
Ailed Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scottishs in Britain
Neal Blake, the director of the game of Britain's Federation of Light Athletics, said that 16 people in Scotland would make a “significant contribution to the game of the team” on the World Cup.
The record number of Scottish passenger cars was selected at the London championship in 2017, beginning on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland there is “a special birth” and the British Federation of Light Athletics must take this into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and support as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's related to what they did.
The Scottish light athletic Federation thinks that what they've done is work.
British light athletics Federation: what they did must be done.
And people on the street think the same.
I don't know why the circumstances are so bad, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some Scottish light athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Buckett, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres; and Ailed Doyle chose a team as its captain.
"Holdy's being modest.
Her Captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"Many passenger athletes, whether they are Scots or not, and wherever they live or train, have come out of this room, feeling proud and eager to win.
The passion and genuine feelings Ailede had invested in her were great."
A silver medal owner of a Commonwealth championship who, on his fifth World Cup, would win the 400-metre race with obstacles, says that 16 Scottish people in a British assembly are "unbelievable."
The previous record, by the number of Scottishs in the world championship, was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Mure, a middle-range expert in flight, was ahead of us and had killed five British and two European records last year.
She'll run 1500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who's going to take part in the race for 1,500 meters, is another Scotsman who needs to pay attention: behind his back, a good season, where there were winnings at a British assembly competition and at his annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first champion of the world when she was the only Scottish team Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says she's "extremely proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only entered the assembly, but in some cases they will claim medals and struggle to get out to the finale.
"The Captain's team chooses the other members of the team, so it was in any case a great honour, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen, "that's a very special thing for me," she added.
"I certainly am very proud of all Scots who have entered the assembly.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And all of them will be light athletes, who will try to get to the pedestal of honor.
What about my Captainly speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very fortunate to take home the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of what we're going to be in the Olympics again.
I got another chance to go to his arena and participate in the competition, and the atmosphere is going to be great."
Locking down criticisms on Facebook: do not go to public office if you are not prepared to listen to voter criticism
The founder of our country knew what a critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but that did not prevent them from critical him of everything from internal politics to his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, made him angry.
But he did not shut his mouth with his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington, D.C., said, "Maybe we, the deaf and the dumb, are being taken away as sheep to the slaughter."
I'm now going to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and wiped out the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Union for the Defence of Civil Liberties sued him.
The subordinate governors called the claim null and void, and the online comment was written in the spirit of "yes and what".
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's also important.
And that's especially important when it's a Hogan-like guy.
He is an amazingly popular republican governor in a democratic state.
He's second to the approval rating of the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactor.
He demonstrated his firm hand in the management of the state and his commitment to its principles.
He also fishes Facebook as the primary way to communicate with his voters and jokes, showing his face after his head chemotherapy on his page.
Thus, blocking the people who come to the governor's page, which is declared to be an official public forum and maintained by the administration on the money of taxpayers, is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, the press secretary, Amelia Ches, defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments is simply a modernization of them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spam agents, and chemists on the Internet.
Post talked to some of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And these are the real people -- not the trolls -- the teacher, the businessman, the pastor who appeals to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible by appealing to Hogan as a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I am disappointed at the lack of response to hate crimes and other news stories recently," she wrote in the section of the commentary to the article in Post.
“I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say that it's the so-called wrapper instead of acknowledging that they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.”
What the subordinate governors call a “concentrated spam attack”, others would probably call a “active life position”.
In the Facebook era, it is easy to reeditate an image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less exhausting than before, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical predecessors, or arresting and closing the mouths of protesters.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just in the numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were taken to his Twitter account.
One of the first decisions on this topic was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge, from Alexandria, James C. Keserice, the chairman of the Laundon County Observatory violated the First Amendment by taking the voter out of his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevin submitted claims to the American Union for the Defence of Civil Liberties for his conduct on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, D.C., the era of accessible postage was about the same as today ' s Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers had grown fourfold, and anonymous letters had severely undermined his credibility.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms of Jurikaola, Valaryus, Belize, and Porcyus wrote to the Washington newspaper derising Washington's decision.
According to the historical documents compiled by George Washington's online document, his office was overwhelmed by petitions critical of his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissenting and speaking is the very foundation of our State.
And true leadership means consent to it.
Ron Rafferty looks forward to household convenience at the Renices Club.
The former European champion, Ron Rafferty, hopes for the convenience of the home for the next three days, when the Renices Club in East Lucia will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tour for older athletes.
Northern Ireland's co-host at Archerfield Links moved towards the final round last year until Paul Ilsa lost, is attached to a new location, and serves as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the club, Jerry Sardi.
“I have seen the construction of the Renaissance Club, and we see it succeed,” said Rafferty.
“The players will see this field at his best moment, it's in excellent condition.
Jerry did a great job taking this place.
He's a strong supporter of this game and he's proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field.”
Englandin Ils looks forward to the opportunity for the first time to stand for the championship, despite the fact that he won his 32-year-old career in the European tournament and in the European Callenge Trust tournament.
"It's really a special feeling," said a Southport player.
“I couldn't try to win Extromadura Open again because he was removed from the schedule one year after I won it.
To return to this corner of the world is magic.
This is a great golf place.
Last year's memories are back, and to me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special experience to win last year.
That was indeed a special time, and we will always remember it.”
Returning to the battle on Gary Orr ' s home land, which joined the European competition for elderly athletes since he reached 50 earlier this year.
The event will be the first in Scotland to be launched at the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Society Open tournament.
"When you play home, it's always more important," the resident of Helensboro Orr said.
"You want to speak well, but you feel that extra burden."
It was a great pleasure playing again, and I showed a good golf.
I am pleased with the way things work out."
In the field, the former winner of the "Masters" tour will be joined by Ian Wesom and the championships of the Mijers for older athletes, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalty.
Orr and former captain, Ryder Cup, Sam Torrans, are two of the six Scottish people in the field; the rest are Andrew Aldkorn, Stephen McLister, Bill Longmewir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free of charge, and parking costs £5 an hour if there is one person in the car, and £10 if there are two or more in the car.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
The turquoise tunnels are already being tested on British roads, which can absorb carbon monoxide emitted by vehicles.
The country ' s transport agency reported on the positive results of a 100-metre tonnage test in one of the northern highways.
The tunnel is six metres high and consists of some of the latest polymer materials that are able to absorb the harmful substances contained in automobile exhausts.
However, the establishment of a whole network of such tonnages is only part of the large-scale measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the English are going to expand the network of charge stations for electric vehicles, undertake a number of activities to reduce traffic on roads, increase the use of commercial transport on electric vehicles and upgrade heavy trucks.
Official statistics show that one quarter of all air pollution is in transport, and unsatisfactory air quality leads to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorcov changed the penalty for a fine for disabled Mamav
Mosgorov changed the sentence of a disabled person named Anton Mamaev, sentenced to a fine of 200,000 roubles for four and a half years.
That's what the TBS reports.
The Public Prosecutor's Office had previously asked the court to replace the term on a conditional basis by explaining its request that the mother's disease “deprives him of imprisonment”.
Anton Mamaev, 28 years old, was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment and served in a general prison for the robbery of which had been the victim of a former Special Forces member.
On 19 July, the court released a man from custody at a retreat in SIPO.
Poverty and death in Indonesian “golden land”
While preparing the meal, Bardin Deguey does not use the stove.
It's very rare even bad.
In his wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai district, in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, housewives usually simply contain a sweet potatoes called the note, which is right in the middle.
After half an hour, the wrapped tubers are served with eager, unwashed hands.
Degia sits on the ground floor; she doesn't have furniture – and it's here that she does her housework, such as a style of homemade mud water from a nearby swamp.
The cleaner serves as a bucket in the room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she's not assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and some are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk in the village after five o'clock”, she says.
This is a rare opportunity to see the daily life of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was joined by Indonesia in 1969 after a doubtful referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The existing movement of independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintained tight control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, while the independent State of Papua New Guinea belongs to the eastern part of the island.
Anarotali is a city as remote as an abandoned one; the road here includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative centre, in Nabir, and then a five-hour crash in a hired car.
There's no public transportation here.
A city with a population of about 19,000 consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; roofs made of corrugated steel are painted with a variety of red walls.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners, arrived.
Prior to the arrival of the Christian missionaries of the Papussa Mee Pago, they worshipped the god named Uga Tame.
Other changes have been made.
“We used to wear this clothes,” says Degei, pointing to his bright, manual turban, dark soup, and shirt.
"We used to wear nothing but leaves on the body earlier."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population lives below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold.
The largest gold mine in the world and the most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, belonging to the Feynx of Freport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a high-level province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freport obtained gold and copper by about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua may boast forests valued at $78 billion.
These assets, however, are causing one disaster for the Papuss, guaranteeing that Indonesia's powerful armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation of The New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freyport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the popes threaten the existence of this golden home and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969 more than 500,000 Papusov have been killed by Indonesian military forces, and thousands more have been raped, subjected to torture and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the massacres of indigenous people in Papua highlands during the seventieth years could be considered genocide.
It was last year alone that the Indonesian police arrested over 3,900 peaceful protestors in the region.
“We will lose everything”, a report published in 2016 by the British diocese, contained evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — especially the frequency of allegations of a different report, rape and electrical defeat — and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of casualties, because each week there are incidents,” says Andreas Harsono, who is involved in research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Guyana has been prolonged as Papua's resources attracted the influx of displaced persons from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of the province is 83 per cent Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawis.
Javan lavenders, a “varungs”, are sold roast chicken and a mixture of "gado-hado" vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to withstand competition.
“Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market at a cheaper cost than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet Yoo, a 20-year-old boy from Paniai who moved to Jayapuru, the provincial administrative centre, for work.
“The indigenous people of Papua, the mother (women) of Papua, lost their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, known as Jokovi, vowed to engage in inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On its way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter obtained support from 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But almost nothing has changed in Papua, and the local people feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, hoping that he would fulfill our hopes for justice,” Joo says.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration of Jokovi Paniay, he had suffered a tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and were singing Christmas hymns from a woman in Enaroli when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one soldier was offended in their tone, and after a while he returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were chasing the children and beating them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Amo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone had set fire to a nearby government election building, and the next day, things got worse.
About a thousand Papusian men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting meadows and filled theWite with the dance of the Papus tribe, and they ran around and represented a bird's song.
Some protestors began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation got worse, the internal radio service soldiers were ordered, "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them", and he was said to have been in an official document that the meters of the TIME magazine had seen but had not been published in the local media.
Eremias Kayama, a 50-year-old, head of the Koto area in Enaroli district, felt threatened and called for calm by asking the crowd to go home.
Nobody wanted to hear it.
“When I turned around, a bullet hit my left wrist suddenly,” he told TIME, standing on the front of his bright wooden house.
Kayam still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet arrived at the side of the lined soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were many shots," he added.
A local resident of Alfius Yowa was caught three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I came up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” sadly told Yohanez, who, like many Indonesians, was using only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... "I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, Senior Inspector of Papua Police, told reporters that his officers were only “protecting” their base because it was under attack.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us”, stated Papua Commissioner Pajio Solistiyo, a police representative in 2015.
“It's a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and a lot more were injured.
News of the killings reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi delivered a bitter speech in Jayapur, in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it will never occur again in the future”, he said.
In October 2016, Viranto, Minister of Security, said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately there was an excuse.
“The majority of violations occurred long ago.
Some of them took place in ninety or at the beginning of zero.
The point is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures to go through," he said.
Viranto then retracted his words by speaking to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
He said, “It will be decided through the judgment.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” of the death of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of Paniai victims faced similar statements with grim disbelief.
“I have been questioned four times over the past three years, but there has been no change,” says Johanez.
I'm tired.
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
“I am afraid the military will arrest me, and I am afraid I will be shot.”
His brother Jakobous also felt that the Paniai people were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten up by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me," he said.
Shots didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at village residents in a nearby Paniai district of Diyai.
In a clash between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help drive the unconscious man to the hospital, one man was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, aged 20 and four, died on his way to a hospital while he was drowning fish in a nearby river.
The angry villagers protested in front of the construction site belonging to the company.
According to police officers, the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by carrying out warning shots.
But the locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) started shooting a crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such panic, we are afraid of retribution,” reported the magazine TIME, 20-year-old Dominggu Badia, who lives near the hospital and sees the wounded in a hurry.
“I hid at my house two days.”
The Diyay Parliament demanded that officers involved in an incident be called to account and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
It has always been a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development is causing a disheartening of the Mae, the Manny, the Dani and the Dalal, spread throughout the green, central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Freedom Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to protect the rights of the Papuss by causing controversial attacks and attacks on the kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of OPM come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judes Kogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and detained groundlessly by the military under the pretext of “Protection of national independence”.
Some never came back.
Among the people of Papua Paniai, it is considered “a safe, abandoned place”.
Poverty is exacerbating frustration.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotha is too expensive for the local people.
Bread is not available at all.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly notes, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five sweet potatoes fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten tuber note is worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
The economic disparities between indigenous papauses and new migrants have increased over the years, and have arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabir Airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually obtained by more educated and wealthy migrants.
The popes rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work here, no money,” says John Gobai, president of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua far away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of the international media remain bitter.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Eskudi and Basel Lonchan were deported from Papua for “low alignment with the organizations concerned”, even though they were rarely authorized to do video.
According to Felim Kein, Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, the commitments made during the Jokovi electoral campaign have not been met.
“Foreign journalists now trying to report from the rebel Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua in Indonesia face new dangers: denials of visa and blacklisting”, he said in a statement.
Lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to direct neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “variable and widespread violations” in Papua, including shooting in Paniai.
The same countries in the past have been supporting OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanta Nasser, withdrew from the panel's statement, informing journalists in Jakarta that “in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations”.
The local people want more foreign Governments to pay attention to the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Netherlands Ambassador for Human Rights, Kiis Van Baar, visited Jayapuru on 4 May, the local people violated their silence by praying: “We want freedom”, as claimed by the source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, a new presidential election will take place in 2019, but the Papussses say it is unlikely to vote again for Jokovi.
“Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of threats from the Alec army, are trapped in poverty, and education and health are in poor condition.
Gobay says that the Paniai, like the other Papussas, feel their vote for Jokovi, a debt that they have to pay.
"We don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting have carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they have buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land in front of the police and military station.
Knowing that justice is likely to never prevail, they will at least prevent the guilty from forgetting their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Jacobs, without raising his head.
"What else have we been doing?"
Fire for the second time covers the oak skyscraper, Fakal
The fire seized one of the world’s tallest skyscrapers at Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to rush out of the 70 - year - old structure at 337 feet [337 m] high.
This is the second fire that has swept through the towering building – a match called Fakelle in two years.
The building had been evacuated, no casualties had been reported and no operational news of the fire had been reported.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and people's cries.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” said a skyscraper named George.
According to the Civil Defence Department of Dubai, fire brigades extinguished at about 4:00 local time (00:00 in Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to the victims.
The event could bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in the field of towering buildings around the world.
The investigation by Fakela after the fire in 2015 revealed that the most affected was the outer panels used to design and isolate themselves.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the system of isolation and the flame panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could have accelerated the spread of the June fire that killed about 80 people.
The increase in the tourist flow in Ida-Viruma in June was minimal
According to data received by a correspondent at the rus.er.ee portal in the Department of Statistics, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists benefited from North-East hotel facilities in June 2017, an increase of 125 persons or 0.6 per cent earlier than in the same period.
At the same time, the number of local tourists declined and foreign tourists increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist destination increased by 7.3 per cent (544 persons) in June to 7,794 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region has increased by 8.9 per cent, or 318 over June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,885 Russian guests were stopped at the Ida-Virumama Hotels.
Andrei Malach made it clear to the worshipers who were responsible for his withdrawal.
Andrey Malach was telling his fans at Instagram who was responsible for his withdrawal from the "First" Canal.
To date, he has not commented on any rumours, but today he placed a piece of a newspaper article in the August 1 issue of The News.
Malach's picture was signed as "boss the milk."
An article on how to prevent the worker's “dealing” and to draw attention to the worker's condition.
When you recall the many reports that the conductor was unable to find a common language with a newly arrived producer who tried to reformat the "Stay Says", it becomes clear that he has so transparently hinted, writing "CP."
It was reported that Andrey Malakov, the televiser, was currently on vacation and did not sign the application for separation from the First Channel.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five soldiers were killed in an explosion
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand and handed over to RIA News.
According to the police, on the night before the military block, a mined car exploded at Giršek district.
We know of 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new CP occurred in Girisk.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange unit.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces is continuing.
Diver made a video of the biting shark's camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Sokal made a video of the shark that bitten his GoPro camera.
Rolelic placed on Facebook an American Marine Fisheries Agency unit in Massachusetts, the staff of which is Scomal.
The incident took place on 2 August on the coast of Cape Cod in the north-east of the United States, specifying the Necn portal.
The man tried to remove the shark on a camera held on a stick during the underwater voyage.
I've noticed a man, an animal that's over three meters long has come near him.
The shark tried to bite a camera without trying to attack a scientist.
The report explained that the predator did the same to determine if the predator was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the instrument.
He also noted that this behavior of the marine animal proved to be a source of innovation for scientists.
The cause of the mass fight at the Ural Military Centre is well known.
A working group of senior Central Military District officers arrived at the Allan Training Centre, where a mass fight occurred, to investigate the incident.
Some details of this godship are already known.
According to the Mash web site on VContakte, the Israeli military contractor number 316112 was brutally beaten because of unmanaged bed.
All of this started with the fact that a private named Saean had clearly ignored an officer's order to refill a scuffle.
Military personnel from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Sayyana backed up her first mouth.
Within half an hour, 140 young men were killed in a barracks with beds and shells, and glass was knocked out.
More than ten people were injured in the mass fight.
THE FATHER denied information about gender.
The study found that at least one fifth of the passengers in the United States were carrying prohibited items onto an aircraft.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited items on board aircraft at United States Transport Safety Administration inspection points, including at least 6 per cent of them on aircraft, unsupervised with prohibited knives or other severe items.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally possessed firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Strats Jet Carters, Inc., and involving more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers were more inclined to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that was prohibited by ATT, 19.7 per cent were mittenillas, compared to less than 15 per cent of Generation X members.
The most common food and water supply for our staff is ATT.
More than 3 per cent admitted that acute items had been deliberately carried out through screening, while 2.2 per cent of women ' s respondents and 3.7 per cent of men ' s respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs on the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to see how many of them had accidentally been smuggled through inspection at airports and how many of them had deliberately done so.
It is expected that most often, consciously or unconsciously, smuggling through searches is done by those who fly the most.
According to the company, the ATT rules are rather complicated and complicated.
People often do not know exactly what fluids they can carry and how many.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ATT chooses are banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought the ATT might be considered prohibited by the book.
Liquids are allowed on inland flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Prüitt refuses to intend to postpone the implementation of Obama's emission reduction regulations
The day after the 15-state action, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama regulations to reduce air-pollutant emissions that had led to education.
Pruittt explained that his agency now had more than it had been in previous administrations to listen to the environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention a suit against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The line was spread around 1 October to ensure that the states met the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid “non-compliance with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, who, before President Trump was appointed to his current position as Attorney General of Oklahoma, had long been known as a consistent opposer of environmental tightening.
After moving to Washington, D.C., the chemical or oil industry was blocked or postponed on several occasions.
A sudden change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of Peuitt's re-entry course.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C., held that Chapter EPA had exceeded its power in an attempt to postpone the implementation of the Obama Administration ' s rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, after drastically changing the course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the obligation of EPA to cooperate with the states in the integrated process of implementing the new standards in a timely manner.
“In the previous EPA Administrations, often unable to meet the time frame, following which they were waiting for action by groups of activists and others and discussed the time frame during the settlement of the case”, Pruitt said, who had filed more than a dozen claims against EPA at his previous post.
“We do not believe in the regulation of trials, and we take the time frame seriously.
We also take seriously our charter and the authority it gives us.”
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point again use his “responsibility to defer and other legal powers” to make sure that the rules of “jusyjdfys” are clear on the basis of all available information.
The Republics in Congress insist on a broader revision of the ozone regulations.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this matter.
The Attorney-General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had filed a lawsuit against EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue the legal pressure.
"The change in the EPA course -- after our claims -- is an important victory in the fight for health and security of 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans, who are directly affected by the discovery of their cities," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delauver, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Colombia, joined the New York challenge.
Earth-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources enter the solar-light atmosphere.
The resulting can cause serious respiratory problems for those who are sensitive, causing thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environmental protectionists welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt ' s course.
"It's a good thing to think about how much pressure it took to get this completely logical step away from the person who is charged with protecting the air that we breathe," said Laurie Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the Trump Administration's ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their particular interests.”
The IAF Congress has extended the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Molecular Federations (IAAF) voted in favour of extending the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
In this way, the Congress supported the IAF Board for the Reconstruction of WFLA, which issued on Monday a report recommending that the suspension be retained.
For the extension of the suspension, 166 people voted against 21 and handed over to TCS.
The report of the IAF Board stated that the WFA has made significant progress towards the conditions set by the Council for the restoration of membership, but that these conditions have not yet been fully met.
Because of the disqualifying of WFA at the World Cup in London, Russian light athletes were forced to speak under a neutral flag.
The team was made up of 19 persons admitted to IAF.
The WFA was disqualified by IAF in 2015.
The report of the World Anti-Doping Agency's independent expert (WADA) Dick Punda was then published, highlighting numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
For details of the last report of the IAF Board, read the IAAF “list”, which extended the sanctions against the WFA.
Both losses
Within the framework of the 3rd U.S. Fontet, the Russian PFL teams included a Newoscock Chemik visiting match against the Kuluga FC.
A little over 10 days ago, rivals played each other in a Russian box, but this time, the picture of the game was quite different.
Chemist didn't give up on the contrary, but the second relaxing at the end of the match led to the inflammation of the head and the fiasco.
After a recent defeat from herders with a count of 0:3 in advance, many prophesied a light victory for their masters.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, newcomers have been forced to accept and act from defence but from the position of force.
In the 1st talon, there was more build-up and advantage over the control of the ball.
Alexei Sirotin, who several times reflected a dangerous blow and gave the partners confidence in his actions, was another very precious match.
Unfortunately, Chemik's attack lacked effort and luck in order to put theculgi defense in a deadlock and to kill the first goal at the exit.
After the break of the game, the game began to take off at the counter-attacks.
The newcomers are more active in the attack.
Alarmful calls were made for our team by the defense errors that allowed the Colombians to create a series of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemik took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the Kalowians' experience played their part -- they would spend their time on the gate in a more informed and cold-blooded way.
After a dangerous attack by Chemik, the ball was turned into an angular ball, which the master's fields, without resistance, were transferred to the gate.
Yuri Dubrawyn was the author of the nude.
In the record meeting, Chemick showed a good game, but he suffered a terrible defeat.
Our team is on another flight -- on August 11, 19th in Moscow at the Torpedo Stadium, named Eduardo Straeltz, the newcomers will be fighting the fanship of the "Centre" group "Arat", consisting of Roman Pavlukenko, Marat Imilalov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexey Rebko.
Come and support Chemist.
The location and time of the newcomers' meeting is 18.30 p.m. near the "Magniya" store (East, D.D., Corp.
Composition of Chemistry: Sirotin, Manohin (k), Romashenko, Shayunov, Khomtov, Gohia, Dudadia, Rysov, Saints, Belian (Adnevs), Andreichenko (Ligin)

According to published telephone text, Trump pressed Mexico over the payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post published a telephone text of conversations between President Donald Trump of the United States and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with the President of Mexico, Enrique Pña Nieta Trump insisted that he stop publicly saying that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The U.S. President opposed him for speaking publicly against the wall and, according to the inmost information, said to him, "You can't say this to the press."
Trump launched his election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern US border and vowed to force Mexico to pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a hot overcome.
Trump told Turnbull that the US should accept the refugees going to Australia, “reasonable”, “rejecting” and “topo” and insisting that, as a result of an agreement concluded by Obama's administration, it would look like an idiot because it intended to stop the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Trump finished the conversation, said Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation all day.”
The bodies of the victims in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
The plane, which is owned by the Russian Air Force and has been carrying the bodies of the Russians killed in Abkhazia, took off at 8:15 a.m. from Sochi to St. Petersburg, passing by the TLS.
At the site of the end point, the staff of the ritual agency, as well as the mayor of the city, will meet with journalists and briefed the Deputy Minister of Curorts and Tourism, Abkhazia Astamir Ahba.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has previously stated that the Government of Abkhazia has taken over all the costs associated with the transfer of the bodies back to Russia.
In addition, official Sukhumi intends to pay the families of the deceased 500,000 roubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhaz leadership expressed its willingness to pay for the travel and residence of tourists to relatives who had died in the bombings in the Republic, but the relatives had sent only confidence to the Republic to act in accordance with established procedures.
On 2 August, at about 4:20 a.m. Moscow time, two explosions began in the town of the Primor Gudaut district at the missile and artillery warehouse of the Ministry of Defence, followed by the detonation of large-scale storage and other ammunition.
As a result, a warehousing room occurred, which caused uncontrolled explosions of various modifications.
As a result, two Russian - Elena Polakova citizens were killed in 1970 and Elena Timofeev, born in 1962, who were in the area of recreation near a silver source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 Abkhaz citizens, were taken to the Republic ' s health facilities with various degrees of severity.
At present, seven people remain in the hospital, the others being discharged.
A large jury will be held to examine the Russian influence on the American elections
Robert Muller, Russian prosecutor, called a large jury in Washington, D.C., to study the impact of Russia on the election of the U.S. President in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The material gathered will examine the Special Prosecutor and decide whether or not they are sufficient for prosecution.
The convening of a large jury gives Muller additional powers to collect evidence.
One of the investigations of a jury panel that started work a few weeks ago would detail a son's meeting, then a candidate for President Donald Trump and Russian lawyer Natalie Vesselki.
To verify the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, the Muller himself promised to do so.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Junior had expanded his legal profession.
Tramp Junior used to say that he had waited for a compromise at the headquarters of a Democratic Republic candidate, Hillary Clinton, but that no documents were presented, but the adoption was followed.
In early August, a number of media reported that the report of the Trumpa youngest on the meeting with Velzika had been literally quoted by the Trump older.
In the White House, it was clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Vice Mayor Penza was kept in the workplace
The Deputy Chief of Administration of Pensa Irin Chirsin was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigation Committee at his workplace, and reported to RRA News.
No official reports have yet been received from the law enforcement authorities on this matter, but the SU-SK press has assured them that they will be followed soon.
At Penza City, they haven't commented on what happened yet.
Irina Shiresin is one of the five vice-chairmen of the Pennsylvania administration.
It has been responsible for urban planning and land relations since April 2015.
Before that, she had long been the head of the Department of Public Health in the Penzen region.
Irina Shiresin is raising three minor children, and she is remarkable that once again she became a mother a year ago, she gave up maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there are no launch launch vehicles or launch vehicles in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the braider Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person in space.
Unlike Soviet monuments, which have been destroyed in some countries, Hagarin's monuments are, on the contrary, moving around the planet.
In 2012, a monument was placed at the American Houston near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument on the Royal Observatory was set for the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Hagarin in Germany in Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited 1963.
A monument in Carlsbad, Czech Republic, escaped demolition in 1992 because of public protests and was moved from the centre of the city to a square in front of the local airport.
The 70th anniversary of Gagarin in Riga was the birth of a monument for Yurios Guarins.
That's the name of the first cosmonaut in Latin, and it looks like if he was 70 years old.
Mors Ford's murder: Activists will lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice
Ford Mercurey drove past the spectators in Monroe village in Georgia in 1948, and with a roar he was driving to the little Morse Ford bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver drove up to the bridge, a group of white men with roses blocked her way.
The average man, in a suit in a thin strip, held up his cigar and looked across the windshield.
The people inside were trembling out of fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" he cried out to the man.
"Take him out of the car!"
When a young black man was dragged out of the front seat, the screams broke the silence.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on July 22, is just staged.
But when they threw a loop on the Roger's neck, almost all the spectators were actually breathed.
Since 2005, activists have come back to the Morse Ford Bridge to re-play the night in 1946 when two black couples, Roger and Dorota Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey, used a lynch.
No one was convicted of those murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years no one has been arrested -- although we see them with us; although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a spot in our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgia Congress who's been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, a performance is a dramatic appeal for action and an annual reminder to the inhabitants of Monroe that injustice has never been rectified.
"We want to investigate, we want to complete, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to find justice," he said.
“We cannot move on to healing and reconciliation until we have justice.”
The coroner covers the simple body of one of the victims of the ligament at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI ' s material received by the E.S. News, over 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of participating in the ligament.
But no one was charged.
Although suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of two connected motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruling authorized for the first time black citizens to vote for the primordium which was to take place during the summer.
About the same election, according to the FBI, the black user Roger Malcolm hit a fight with a knife from Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that according to a rumour in town, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorota's wife, and that the child she was to give birth was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, the FBI reported that Loya Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 a deposit to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorota and their cousins, May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of prison and drove up to the Morse Ford bridge, a crowd of conductors surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and ordered the killing of Harrison," one of the FBI's reports.
“It is equally evident that there was a conspiracy between state law enforcement agencies and the city, which not only took part in the killings but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he said.
"They all were killed to send a signal to the blacks in the city. If you register and vote, you will be the same."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green runs an annual playwright at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visual, captures the viewer, and tells of the deep racism that many would consider to be no more in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks it's important.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they're showing us our own uglyness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear that I've survived."
This year’s performances began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors, a dozen whites, the rest of the blacks gathered in the room and listened to the annual review of the play.
Wade Marbo was a director with Greene.
He played the role of the chief member of the clan for several years, but said that the role was still not easier.
"I think I'm scared because it's not the person I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
The actors Darryus Bradshaw and Nick Racon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, play their part.
The show starts with Malcolm, who's furious about Hester sleeping with his wife, Dorota, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nega, get out of my house!"
Crying Racon back.
It's giving you a blow.
And at the same moment, all (at least all black actors) are offended by a homorrhage.
Green laughs louder than anyone.
Ascón asks.
He's concerned and upset.
Am I winning?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think whites used to say nig."
"Yes yes," one of the black performers laughs.
"You've got to call out a hard 'p'."
And so also energy changes in the room: discomfort changes a sense of association.
All must do what is right, not only for the play, but also for the memory of four people killed.
The scene starts first.
This time, when the Racon speaks the word 'n', it becomes clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The connectome ends cruelly and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of actors and makes a sad song by Billy Holida "Strange Fruit."
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
A hundred yards away, the spectators wipe the tears and sweat out of her eye.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites among the viewers.
One couple came from Théthia, New York, to see the performance; many live around.
All of them endured nearly eight hours of intense spirituality as Brooks led them into a pilgrimage to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until now, the killings have remained only a history, but now, when they are at the same spot as the men are scrambling, their ghosts seem to be hanging in the air.
When the last note of the song is suffocated, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend to their heads, touch on blood paint, and unmovable bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," said one little boy, as if to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
Activators throw ropes off their necks and wipe tears away.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, a man in a suit who's playing the top doll.
Nick Razcon hugs the other two actors and suddenly cries into their arms — the emotional load of the play was finally overpowered.
"All right," one of the women whispers.
"We know your heart is good.
You had a reason for this."
Later, the audience will sit down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are engaged in a lively discussion of a performance with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Daplinski is struggling to find words to describe what she feels after the play.
"It's difficult to listen to these horrible, horrible words, and the actions... of people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lilac are still going on," she adds, "only now it's called shooting the police."
Another corner of the room is Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender.
He said that he had begun planning for the next year's submission.
"The stop is encouraging to us, because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you do not learn from this lesson, it may happen again.
Those who do not study their history are condemned to its repetition."
The Court fined Navell for violations at the “Agency Saturday”
The Simon Court of Moscow fined Alexey Naveno 300,000 roubles for violating the organization of the meeting.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence provided for in article 20, paragraph 8, of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation.
Formerly, the judge of the Simon Court of Moscow, Hissyr Moussakaev, completed the administrative review of Leonid Volkov, the head of the staff of opposition, Alexei Navlovov, who had been held accountable under the same article as Navola.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of leaflets at the “Agency Saturday” held by the supporters of Navovovo in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
The police, when they saw the aggitals following the participants in the Sabbath, believed that the organizers had deliberately concealed it, a public action (the purpose of which was to request prior permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zdanov and Alexander Pomazewov applied for an end to the administrative proceedings because of the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had failed to make certain mistakes in drafting the protocol.
The Volkov's “substantial Saturday” itself was not delayed, but it received an agenda that required him to appear at the police station to report on an event that was being carried out with his active participation.
The same agendas were given by Navell and another opposer, Nicholas Láskin, to the opposition.
A shooting bride and three wedding guests were arrested in Mordavia
The Mordoviya court arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including a bride.
This was reported to the Office of the Investigation Committee in the Republic.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 July.
During the argument, a 42-year-old resident of Saranska shot at the guests several occasions at an event that took place at a village pond to bathe.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code, article 30 (3), and paragraphs “a”, “e”, article 105, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code (“Tempting the killing of two or more persons committed in a hooliganian manner”).
According to Interfax, the local media reported that the man had opened the shooting because the wedding guests decided to take a bath at his section of the wedding.
Minenergo will strengthen the demand for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular a turbine for power plants.
When gas turbines are launched, GEC turbines, oil refineries and oil production facilities for equipment suppliers will make it available with Minergo and the Federal Technology and Export Control Service.
The draft decision of the Government had already been prepared and had been tabled in public debate.
The new requirements will apply only to “critically important energy equipment” to Russia.
The document has identified potential threats such as obtaining information and access to management by foreign special services, criminal elements and structures, bad faith partners and hackers.
The European Union has expanded the anti-Russian sanctions due to Siemens
On 4 August, the European Union press stated that the anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded owing to a scandal over the supply of Siemens turbines to Crime.
This has been previously reported by the Week Arms.
The EU Council press stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been expanded owing to a scandal with Siemens production turbines who had allegedly been brought to Crimea by way of the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals by member countries to expand the anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the current day, and that the decision had been taken, the sanctions against Russia had been expanded.
Pearson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British educational group Pearson announced that it would reduce the number of additional 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 per cent by the beginning of a new restructuring programme aimed at dealing with the problems faced by their businesses.
These job cuts, which, according to the head of John Fallon, will mainly take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, take place in addition to the 4,000 jobs lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it planned to reduce the cost by another £300 million ($394 million) in May, through a third cost-reduction programme, to try to re-establish a business that had been hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its share in Penguin Random House, its partner, Betelsman, said that its projections for the year remained unchanged, after it had announced a 1 per cent increase in sales of the main product in the first half of the year to £ 2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: Nato soldiers died as a result of the suicide bombing
According to official sources, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers were injured and an interpreter was injured, as NATO reported.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the Carabah city area.
This explosion is the last of the bloodshed that struck Afghanistan this month, killing more than 30 people on Tuesday in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO reported that the explosion that occurred on Thursday night occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by a “transmitted man-made improvised explosive device”.
All the wounded are reported to be stable and receiving treatment at the United States Military Hospital at the Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the “Islamic State” in Karabah is the main concern for NATO forces located near Bagram.
In the first half of 2017, the United Nations reported at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomber killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed they had attacked.
On 31 May, a powerful explosion in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people — the largest number of casualties in the country since the Taliban were removed from power by troops led by the United States in 2001.
Violence is at the centre of the poor situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States estimates whether the United States military force in support of the military and police forces in the country needs to be increased.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its lines of conduct and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The after-trial Environmental Protection Agency cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of a law on air pollution
The American Agency for the Environment has reversed the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama Era Act, which requires states to limit emissions from air pollution one day after 15 states have sued the agency as a result of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to carry out the so-called ozone 2015 measurements, emphasizing that this step showed the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with and sensitivity to our state partners”, said Scott Pruittt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone ozone measurements in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet more stringent air integrity standards for one year, to October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, joined the Federal District of Colombia in filing a claim that this intention was unlawful.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to reverse a wide range of environmental protection orders introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader programme aimed at the brilliant economic growth of Trump.
But actions in this direction have generated resistance from democracies and natural law enforcement organizations, concerned by the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency website states that ozone-related air breathing “may undermine the function of light and reinforce respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.
The Association of European Business against the New Anti-Russian Sanctions
The Association of European Business did not agree with the U.S. Economic Sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a significant reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement stated that business was an important link between countries and people, so free trade should not be restricted.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association encourages the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new course of conduct that would enable business to be separated from politics and a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
Members of the police request that the movement on the coast coast in Pskove be restricted to the police.
The people's people's electors sent an address to the UMMA Chief in the city of Sergei Surina on the issue of movement on the coast of the Great River.
Constantin Bolotin, Grigor of the Parties, and Valérie Lesters believe that motorists are preventing people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, the monitoring of drivers would help make the area safer and safer.
The problem is that the violators ignore the Pedestrian Road signs and freely cross the coast.
Capital repairs and improvements are due.
Sports and children's playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
According to the Pskov News Agency, during the evenings, a central coastal patrol is conducted by officers of the PPP Motoipa and wives.
They reduce the number of motor vehicles passing, but the traffic does not stop completely.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to remove hard disks
President Vladimir Putin of Russia proposed that investigative authorities should be prohibited from removing servers and hard disks from working computers in enterprises.
That was stated by the Head of State at a meeting on the investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, “the use of measures leading to the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard disks from computer and server computers, should be excluded for the purpose of investigation”.
Putin noted that, if investigators have such a need, “suffice the removal of copies, the assurance of them and the use of them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that it is not possible “to create conditions that prevent the enterprise from continuing its activities until the payment of taxes is impossible”.
Olga Bozov told her how much she wanted to call her ex-wife.

There was something in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact, Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with his latent wife, Queen Margrete.
This year's four, the golden wedding, but the couple's agenda is not about preparing for the celebrations, but about a mighty dispute.

Henrik lives in France, although he remains the queen’s formal wife.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia called upon Washington to cease to ensnare Moscow
IN THE Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pens, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans, responded.
A statement from the foreign policy department was circulated some time ago.
In its commentary, the Ministry pointed out that the United States was increasingly using cold-war images, an inadequate contemporary reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the United States authorities to stop targeting the Russian Federation.
As reported in The Week's Arms the previous day, U.S. Vice President Mike Pens accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the western Balkans and organizing an unfortunate coup d'état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomanenko are meeting for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive friendship
Vasilyy Lomanenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to have been moving steadily to hold the most exciting boxing match of up to $147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They held separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, an inconsistent champion in the light weight of the World boxing Council, went down the corridor to welcome Lomanenko, a World Boxing Organization champion in the second half-mile weight.
After the unanimous victory of Garcia over the world's former championship in the four weighted categories of Erien Broner on Saturday, the two boxers are in the five best boxers regardless of weight categories.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "How are you doing, champion?
Good luck with that."
Lomanenko defends his belt in combination with Miguel Marriga on Saturday night at seven o'clock on ESPN.
When boxers called for the photo, manager Lomanenko Egis Climas noticed that the potential decisive battle between them would have been one.
“I used to be half a weight” recalled Garcia.
“I'm in the category for Broner [up to 140 quid], but I'm not that big.
I'm not good enough for 140.
I want to get down to the semi-ictle.
And he needs to go up to half a pound [up to £135], and then we'll set up a match.
That's what the fans want.
Let us make this happen to them."
Lomanenko agreed.
“Boxus needs this interface.”
Climas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of his strategy that Lomanenko had been carrying out his debut combat in weight, 135 later this year, to appoint a meeting with Garcia (37-0.30 knockouts) for the next summer, who also wanted to fight against the winner of the link between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fighting for the title of the world champion in the army of the Lorem on 23 September.
“The fight may be on PPV because all the fans asked for it,” said Garcia, expressing their readiness to fight later on the channel that will offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the primary names.
No other names will be of such interest.
Once they are ready...”
Garcia said that Lomanenko thought he was a “extreme boxer” and might visit his Saturday friend.
But Lomanenko did not immediately flaunt Garcia with praise and said that he thought that the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you tried to knock on it."
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the force of the blow and then the boxing.
They both said they felt the tension rising in front of their own unit.
“This fight must take place.
No other battle is so interesting.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
He said: "I've waited for one of the fat boxers, and there he is, Mikey.
It will be a great battle."
On several central streets of Moscow, the movement will be shut down on weekends.
On this weekend, 5 and 6 August, the movement will be confined to the capital at Tver Street from the Nastasian alley to the Triumph Square, as well as to the 1st Tver-Yam Street.
In addition, the train will be closed on Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the first Tver-Yam Street.
At all sites, the overlap will be at both lanes, and the Information Centre of the Moscow Department of Transport will report.
The streets will be closed from midnight on 5 August until 5 a.m. on 7 August for their improvement.
Also on the weekend, traffic at the Moscow coastal section will be closed.
There is an ongoing construction of the Zanqué park.
Putin instructed the Ganpacuurate to check out Baikal.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia directed the Office of the Attorney General of the Russian Federation to verify the territory of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“I would like to request that the Baikal territory be checked for illegal and environmentally harmful activities”, said Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested that action be taken if the facts of the violations were to be found.
New results of tests to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results from tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden subject to new medical assessments of age show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were evaluated as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of those results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rätttsmedicinalverket) started tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make an assessment of the age of asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) had criticized for failing to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 testing cases, and the forensic medical agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were evaluated as 18 years of age or older, and in 25 other cases, the forensic agency assessed that the tester was “probably 18 years of age or older”.
In 432, the conclusion stated that the person was “probably under 18”.
The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of a person is in doubt.
According to Johan Gernsson, an agency of forensic medicine, the results have been consistent with previous months.
“We don't see a big difference between statistics in the past few months, the numbers quite appropriate”, he said to the “The Local”.
The high percentage of cases in which people have been assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers have lied over their age.
In May, the agency published 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, “most likely the age of the test is 18 years or more”.
However, after considering the 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, the person had openly stated that he was 18 in progress this year.
The method of medical assessment of the age, consisting of X-raying of the teeth of wisdom and the scan of knee joints and giving them to dentists and X-ray scientists, has also led to criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist at the Karolin Institute Claude Marcus, whose job is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have gone through sexual maturity earlier or later.
“I have had reasons to think about it, and I don't think we should use the measurement methods that are now being used.
Biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can't define it with confidence, we don't have to pretend we can," he said to the newspaper Matro.
However, Gerenssen of the Forensic Medicine Agency said in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of mistaking a child for an adult.
It is with the greatest risk that we face when a person is about 18, in which case he is about 10 per cent.”
I guess if we run for the presidency.
On a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said he was ready to consider whether he would be running for the presidency of Russia in the elections in 2018, transmitting the Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request of the residents of the village of Bouratsko District.
During a video conference on firefighting in Buratia and Irkut district, the interlocutor said to Putin: "Multimir Vladimirrovich, we have a request that, when the next presidential election comes, we all ask you to run again to this office."
"All right, I'll think about it, thank you," the president replied.
On 28 July, the Russian President's Spock press secretary, Demetry Peskov, commented on the comments of some media that Vladimir Putin, elected headquarters, would be headed by the President's administration, Anton Weino.
The sands called these assumptions "neither on which it is not based, hypothetical reasoning".
"As long as there are no headquarters, until the headquarters has been set up far, before the election campaign is far away," said Peskov.
"As long as it's not on the agenda," said Peskov.
The Governor of West Virginia stated that he was moving to another party.
Governor of West Virginia, Democratic Party representative Jim Justice announced on Thursday during a meeting with President Trump, moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the democracies have separated themselves from me,” said Governor Justin.
“I speak to you today with many prayers and many thoughts,... today I say to you, O people of Western Virginia, that I can no longer be helpful to you, while I remain a Democratic Governor.”
The rally blew up with applause.
“That's why tomorrow I'm changing my registration for the Republican,” he added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play differently."
In the past, Trump had promised that a significant statement would be made at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won the West Virginia with a 42 per cent down, and Justin did not support the Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes, is the only billion-dollar state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited coal from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday night that “the transition of Governor Justice to another party is another strike against the Democratic Party, which is more likely to prevent than working to make our country great again”.
“In view of the 15 governors and the control of the lowest number of state legislative bodies in history, the declaration by the Governor of Justice is just another renunciation of the party, which has no leadership from above and is unable to find a positive, unifying message”, reported in a statement by CBS News representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party Ron McJeniel.
The cat-wreck called Mr. Krascowitz found a house thanks to the social media.
A pilot in Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat named Mr. Krascowie weighing more than 15 kilograms after it became famous by the Internet.
This is what the ashable reports.
At the end of June, a photo of a cat in a pet store in Facebook asked him to find his owner, because "he's obviously someone who's used to. "
In the comments, users noted that the expression of an animal's face could become a new memorial.
The publication received over 3,000 swearings and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to take refuge in Mr. Krascowitz.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazi, who promised to take up his weight.
In an interview on the WNCN radio, the American woman reported that she had already had this experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now she weighs just over five pounds.
In July, Reddit drew attention to a cat from Australia with an unusually long paw.
Posting a photograph of an animal, more than 68,000 views were made.
Commentators pointed out that she could do a career in model business.
Kou praised Russia's “exclusive” apology for the Doping Scandal
The International Lung Athlete Specialist Sebastian Coo commended Thursday for what he described as sincere apology from Russia in connection with the Doping scandal but reiterated that the moment was not right now to allow the country to participate again in the sporting competitions.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Light Athletics, Demetrius Puttin, reported at the Congress of the International Association of Molecular Federations, which had been held the day before the World Cup on Light Athletics, that his country's exclusion from sporting competitions was just and that he was determined to fight the Doping.
He apologized: “All sportsmen who had stolen gold and silver medals from competitions.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Molecular Federations voted to retain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence of the use of doping, which was financed by the State.
“I found that today’s response was very sincere”, said the report’s President of the International Association of Molecular Federations of Kou.
“To all the council and to the Congress, the Russian Federation itself is pleased to admit that it is going through very hot times and is now doing its utmost to take care of the federal restructuring.”
Kow said he also liked Russia's acceptance of the criteria for its restoration.
“I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that now is not the time to restore Russia to rights,” said Kou.
“We have to do everything in the next few months to fix this situation.
Our main principle was our desire to separate pure athletes from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Molecular Federations, will participate under the neutral flag in the World Light Athlete championship, which will begin on Friday in London.
The Head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Molecular Federations, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met in order to rebuild Russia.
According to his report to reporters in London on the International Association of M & D Councils, drug testing is still not done in sufficient volume, and the away coaches are still doing their work in peace.
The Court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of being a guest
The detained Ukrainian Security Service (SSA) journalist Vasily Muraviski has been arrested for two months, transmitting the IAS.
An Internet officer, Journal Gitomir, is suspected of treason by placing his publications on Russian websites and undermining Ukraine's territorial integrity.
However, Russia does not support measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering it a “war policy” against the media.
Two years after the outbreak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to enter into a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The Comandante Borsini patrol ship entered Libya's territorial waters to stop the influx of illegal migrants with the Navy.
The start of the operation was decided by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome has agreed to it with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of its territory.
The opposing Cabinet and the Yugoslav-based Libyan Parliament accused Italy of violating Libya ' s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe these threats and intended to ship another warship into Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week during the negotiations between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Jentiloni and the head of the Europeanly recognized Libyan Cabinet, Faiza Saraj.
The Italian authorities had entered the maritime mission to combat illegal migration since the publication of statistics in July on the number of illegals that had come from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
In the Government, the resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
A massive crash occurred in Skype
The global failure of Skype service was recorded today in several countries around the world.
Users on Thursday, 3 August began sending complaints to programme developers.
In Microsoft, it was emphasized that experts are already working hard to address the challenges faced by the European and North American people, and the RIA News has been updated.
We recall that Skype also happened in June this year.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the Ukrainian team on light athletes were suspended from participating in the CMM
Olga Landh and Olya Powh, specializing in short-range flight, are excluded from Ukraine ' s assembly to the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the country's light athletic Federation (FLAU) website.
This decision was made by the executive branch of the International Association of Molecular Federations (IAAF) in connection with disciplinary proceedings for light-breeding.
The Ukrainian delegation was also excluded from the training of Coach Sergey Bachenko.
According to Sportarena, IAF suspects female athletes using doping.
Prow is the bronze pool of the Olympics (2012) and the World Cup 2011, the European 2010 championship in the estaphate of 4 to 100 metres, and the Earther is the winner of the European firstborn in 2012 at Estaphet 4 to 400 metres.
A world championship in a light athlete in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How soccer rules will affect Neimare's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spend by European football clubs do not prevent the world record of Neimar's transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French "Pare Saint-Jerman".
Whatever the consequences may be further in the chain, for the Parry Saint-Jerman on the part of FEA, the governing body controlling European football in which the authorities prohibit the teams from participating in the Ligue of Champions.
It follows from the rules of the financial “fair-pire” introduced by FEA in 2011 that SWV will eventually have shown that the Neymar transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid Euro22 million ($262 million) only to free Brazilians from the contract, and Neimar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
The TSW can certainly be distracted in order to hire Neimar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the rich energy of the ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFF introduced Michel Platoni after his election as President of WEFA in 2007.
An ex-French football player believed that clubs that were heavily indebted in their quest for success, in fact, were chewing and risking a breakdown if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on the debt of clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change in business model that Roman Abramovic originally used in Chelsea in 2003 to buy a club with good potential and then to spend seriously to improve the team and build a world brand, it has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year assessment period in 2018, clubs can suffer losses of Euro30 million.
And while Platiní was reproached as president in 2015, his successor to UFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
“We know that FFP is alive, and we're going to press the rules,” declared the Associated Press agency Andrea Traverso last week, controlling the FFP in UFA.
While TSW will pay Neimar's contract a single purchase, it may, in order to be accountable, distribute the amount for the entire duration of its contract.
Neimar signed a five-year contract, so that transfer value can be shown on an annual basis as a cost of €44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the heavy sanctions were imposed on the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
The SWA imposed a fine of 60 million euros (at that rate $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the composition of its team to the League of Champions during the 2014-1015 season, 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UFA is tracking clubs that may try to intercept its financial inspections by spreading their income from the owners of the club.
While the Kathari company could have sponsored SWV, if the amount of funding had been found to be higher than the standard market rates, UFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014, when UFA decided that the funding from the Office of Tourism of Qatar had been spread out.
It was reported that part of Neima's earnings in SWA could have been paid by the organizational committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But TPW and Qatar 2022 deny that Neimar will be the Ambassador of the World Championship, and such a manoeuvre could easily have been detected by UFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on SWA mean that FEA will be even more careful to monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, people familiar with the situation reported that UFA did not have a preliminary discussion with SWA on the Neimar transfer.
They talked to Associated Press under anonymous conditions, since they were not authorized to discuss the situation of PAW.
According to the latest published report, between 2015 and 10 million euros arrived at €542.4 million.
Reporting for the last fiscal year has not yet been published.
The TSA expects Neima's arrival to be an enabling place for sponsorship, sale of attributes and T-shirts with the team logo.
At the club, it is assumed that it will increase by at least 30 per cent because of the recruitment of a new player.
Undeniably dissociated by the departure of one of the best football players, the Spanish League tried to prevent the Neimar transfer, stating that SWA would violate the financial “fair tribe”.
“This obvious case of “financial doping”, with the club and the State,” said the Spanish newspaper “AS”, President La Léfie Javier Tebas, referring to Qatar as the ultimate owner of the SWA.
Arsen Wenger, who belongs to the American sports magnet, shares the doubts of La L. League about the financing of the club by the State.
“It's all the impact of equity, and it's completely changed the landscape of football over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, perhaps everything.
It is becoming very difficult to observe the financial player play because there are many ways and many reasons why a country can be represented by such a serious player.
The order and place of oath will determine the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will take an oath of allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President will define such amendments to the second reading of the law as a Committee of the State on Legislation and the State.
A week ago, the deputies planned to define directly the order of oaths in the law.
From the solemn oath, children up to 18 years of age, as well as incapacity, will be released from the revised text of the amendments to the draft law on “RF nationality” (at the disposal of Izvestium), which the Committee will consider on 11 July before the second reading at its meeting.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of the oath of citizenship of the Russian Federation instead of the formal signature of documents on 6 June during a meeting with the Speaker of the State of Vácheslav Vladimir.
Members of the delegation have amended this idea in the form of a second reading in the bill to repeal the citizenship decision of those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, for public appeals to terrorism or its public justification in the media or in the Internet (art. 205.2 of the Criminal Code), as well as for the seizure of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is related to terrorism (art. 4 of article 211 of the Criminal Code).
According to the draft law, the logic of the bill was as follows: by making documents for citizenship, a person is signed under a promise to comply with Russian legislation - put on the path of extremism, and is in violation of that promise.
The draft law was introduced in April to the Duma by Vladimir Vasilev of the Duma, Gennady Züganov (CPR), Vladimir Zirinski (LDR), Sergey Mironov of the Russian Orthodox Republic and the Speaker of GD Vacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies adopted it on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on Hospitality and Legislation approved the text of the draft for second reading, but it has now been revised.
It now states that the oath order will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
The parliamentarians had previously been about to describe the procedure directly in the Law on Citizenship of the Russian Federation, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting before the Russian State and flag in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text where such an event would take place - a list of places where the Gerb of the Russian Federation might be located - was governed by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, the Cabinets of Heads of Government, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of the federal executive branch, etc.
Most likely, it could also be the Assembly.
A solemn oath of desire for citizenship will be made by officials after checking their documents.
But the Russian passport will not be available until after the oath has been delivered, it is out of a completed text.
A week ago, the draft stated that oath should be preceded by the signing of an order.
The updated text says that Russia will be sworn to at age 18, not at 14.
A rule has been maintained that the oath will be exempt from oaths that are ineligible or unable to act, as well as those that cannot make, read or personally sign the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release from this procedure and “others”,
Also in the updated bill, special arrangements have been introduced for the admission of Ukrainian citizens to Russian, which are considered bearers of the Russian language.
They would have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by making a declaration to the competent authority of Ukraine for that purpose.
Notarized copy of the application will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
A waiver of “other” nationality, as it is now, will not be necessary if provided by an international treaty or if it cannot be “for reasons beyond the control of the individual”.
The corresponding amendment of the Act was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first Vice-President, DD Ivan Melnikov (KPR), Natalya Polyxsky, Paul Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all “One Russia”).
I think many of you know that it's not possible to get a certificate from Ukraine.
Accordingly, a great many people are awaiting a decision regarding their citizenship of the Russian Federation, explaining the previous day the head of the thinking committee on government and law, Paul Krasheninnikov (ER).
Furthermore, the text made it clear that restrictions on certain posts for foreigners would not apply to those who had refused “other” nationality in writing and had given the former passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but “for reasons beyond its control” had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service, from being hired at facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Nor can a person with dual nationality or residence permit be a member of the State or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on 1 September 2017 and that the necessary regulations should be prepared at that time.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in the Jairus of the Americas and the Detective of the Detectives.
The current iteration of history is nostalgic, at the same time, about the glorious days of the figures in the 1980s; about the age of the boundary in the 1990s (sometimes when eminent masters David Wayne and Michael Schlatter made the comedy "State" for MTV); and about themselves -- that is, in 2001, before her stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Paul and Paul Radd went to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time an uplift and acquiesce of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise she seems to be an anachronism.
The camp's first day was surprisingly good, and not only because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the vegetable-speaking can, which was proclaimed by H. John Benjamin).
The result is doubling the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached the age of majority, thus making it impossible to get back into the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have played adults, have less emotional roots, and their parody is more system-wide and includes reefs from the 1990s steel movies of the type "Rucky Cooking Wheel."
In one episode, the character is delivered by Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled skaters, and "a bite of other things from 1991. "
Many stories are the same.
Good - bye Cup (Shoutter), now a writer, still has not reached a mutual agreement with Cathy, Margerit Moro.
Victor (Ken Marino) still has her virginity.
There's still a mad and vile conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (then Schoiler) is now instigating George Bush, the older man (an tested parody in Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the retreat from it.
It's especially fun to see young Randa, who's singing Matt Dillon's song from "The Ones," the character of whom the former big man Andy looks like now is an old man.
This franchise would have been a success if you had an accident in the spirit of a recursive series of "Seven Up" until it reaches the point that it would have been a logical conclusion: "A great American summer: twenty years later," where in the last scene the whole company would have went to a movie at the first film of "Gorce American summer."
The Master Detective in the Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: cold war memories from "Americans", "Bold Blonde", or even "Bleska" with its images of the East and West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alesandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas, depicts a telefilm: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheistism and Marxist-Leninist pathway.
The main roles — that of Gregor and of the idealist Joseph — are performed by Florin Pierre, Jr., and Cornelius Uly, while they were spoken in English by Changing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Leb.
That's a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (the police spend time watching a chess game, how Americans could watch soccer).
A team of famous human voices, including Jenny Slat, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevini, makes it interesting to play "Remember the Voice."
But "Strategic Detective" is holding such a hold on the unlikelyless propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are too long, and it's not often funny.
If he were to be done in a shorter manner, the "Trafficky Detective" could better cope with his occupation in the spirit of an agitpropa; for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the United States Embassy, two fat people sitting in the lobby that absorb a lot of hamburgers.
This image of an imaginary Communistist says that Western culture can do anything to make a fence.
The fabricated Romanian writers of the film are not so wrong: we do so with our own recent history, and with them too.
Russia's Super Bowl Cruise Fund between Spartacus and Locomotive will be in the order of 30 million roubles.
The President of the Russian League soccer Prime Minister (PFL) Sergey Porkin reported on this at a press conference.
According to the head of the EPF, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports the RT.
He also added that so far there were almost no matches tickets.
The "Spartacus"- "Locomotive" match will be held on Friday, 14 July, at 9:30 p.m.
According to the TLSS, Spartacus is a current champion of the Russian Federation, and Lokomoot is the holder of the country's Cuba.
Two young vices cleaned the furniture store for 200,000 roubles
A 37-year-old expert with a furniture firm approached the police the other day.
The man stated the theft of expensive tools from the store, causing serious damage to its production.
The antichrists ’ productions cost almost 200,000 roubles — two welds, a perforator, a hydraulic, and a swan.
The guards began to search for criminals and soon went out to the inhabitants of the Bashcortostan district, a group of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs press services, the accomplices entered the enterprise, broke the front door and removed the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the first car service to the stolen equipment.
A theft case has already been initiated against them, and only a portion of stolen instruments have been returned to the legitimate owner.
The State commented on Medvedev's attitude toward the Russian Federation and the United States.
The US and Russia should be able to work together.
The official representative of State Gezer Nauert made a statement in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, on the relations of the two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Government stated that by adopting the new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the FF a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a low level, but noted that there is a need to look for “beneficials for interaction”.
"Look at the south-west Syrian Truce, which has been observed for nearly a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the US and Russia," cites the words of a diplomat of REA News.
At the same time, the foreign policy representative refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK, President Donald Trump, signed in the past.
At the same time, he acknowledged that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior has grown amate rose and quartz
A major unit at the French fashion home of Dior - Dior Joalierie - supplemented by Ross Dior Bagatella and Bois de Rose.
They had five new rings and three rings of flax tapes.
Two new rings and amethyls, a pink quartz, and diamonds made up of glycotics (a manual stone cutting) and paviar about the 70-year-old house were released in the line of Rose Dior Paré Catelan.
The head of Dior Joelie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by the rose that grew at his seat in Granville by Cristian Dior, and the Paris Gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Kathelan.
Trump found the perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia
President Donald Trump, of the United States, strongly criticized the members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have worsened relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at a very low and dangerous level.
"Maybe you can thank Congress, these people can't even give us medicine," wrote the president on Twitter.
On the eve of Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They are particularly affected by Russian banks and power companies.
The White House subsequently circulated a presidential statement in which it stated that the law would not allow the US to enter into beneficial transactions and would further bring the Russian Federation, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian business refused to buy Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
The business member from Belarus, Victor Propesene, withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) the application for purchase of a subsidiary unit from Seberbank.
The business man's decision explained the BBC's intention to “focus on our other planned investments and projects that we're working on”.
According to Mr. Prokoccene, this would be a “best investment in time” despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Propeston became the main buyer for the purchase of a unit of the Russian bank in Ukraine following the rejection in July of the application by the NorvikBank Grigoria Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guzeriev.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Peter Porosenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiary structures in March.
One such financial organization, other than TBT and the Foreign Bank, was Sberbank.
Nova identified the cause of the blackout in Crimeu
In the Ministry of Energy, the Russian Federation identified the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of department, Alexander Nowak, explained what had happened.
He said that the peninsula was left without electricity because of a traffic accident in the Krasnodar province.
A truck caught in the accident running the electric transmission line resulted in the cancellation of Cuban and associated Crimean networks.
Errors in the electricity supply of large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Professionals worked out the trouble over a few hours.
Originally, it was reported that the cause of the blackout could have been an abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will retain interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and declining inflation have caused rumours of a possible increase.
The Bank of England had warned that economic growth would remain inefficient and had left interest rates without change among the growing pressures on family incomes.
Professionals of the Committee of Monetary Policy of the Bank (MPC) voted from 6 to 2 for retention rates at 0.25 per cent, with fewer members in favour of an increase in the rate this month because weak economic growth has weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly report on inflation, the bank limited its projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in autumn.
However, the bank warned that the increase in rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the offset inflation, and said that the cost of loans would probably be higher than expected in financial markets.
Committee members also voted in favour of abandoning a part of a vast array of economic development measures launched a year ago by a drug crisis.
Since the next February, the Bank will close the emergency funding plan for lending banks, although it has reported that it is currently due an additional £15 billion – up to £15 billion.
In its decision-making protocol, the bank said: “The growth of gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to remain slow in the near future, while the pressure on the real income of families continues to affect consumption.”
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that to halt inflation, “some tightening of financial policies” would be needed in a “almost greater” amount than expected of markets.
At this point, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “slow” and “limited”.
Bank projections for promotions this year and next year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank maintained a constant forecast of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After those news, the stringing fell against the dollar and the euro.
The cost fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and by 0.4 per cent to Euro 1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after the recent disappointing growth rates had weakened the expectation of higher growth; GDP then grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter compared with 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to a representative of the Bank, growth appears to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it begins to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little cause for joy to households affected by high inflation and very small wage increases: according to the bank, pressure will increase before a decline is made.
The Bank added that financial policies “could not prevent” earnings over the next few years, but expected that salaries would be restored “significant” by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also looking forward to growing as a result of the growing demand for British goods, owing to the low exchange rate, which offsets some of the lower consumption costs.
The decision was taken one year after the reduction of the rates in last August to 0.25 per cent following the shocking outcome of the referendum on the withdrawal from Europe, which resulted in the downfall of the pound.
Bank estimates are that it will take four years to fully influence prices and economies.
Before the bank made its final decision at the rates, there was a noise around the expected increase in rates, as inflation was also increasing the pressure on households, with three committee specialists asking for an increase to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month, from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that this fall was expected and was offset again in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher figure than the projected 2 per cent is fully attributable to the low rate of pound.
Andrew Montlake, the director of Korea’s mortgage brokers, said: “If you take into account the recent drop in the swap course, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive, as creditors are demanding business opportunities and are looking for a good year’s end.
The market is particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing agreements, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of having no commission, as well as a low rate, is more popular than ever.”
The Public Health Service has written an HIV-related drug to 10,000 people.
Since September, patients will have access to a revolutionary HIV prevention drug after the battle of the High Court on the issue of drug financing from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that HIV pre-respiratory prevention (PRES), a sexually transmitted pill which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection among persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year probation period of about 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court last year, which had argued that the National Health Service had an opportunity to pay the REP, despite its claim that it should be funded by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was called a “important innovation” by President Simon Stevens of the National Health Service of England, and the National AIDS Control Agency (NAAT) called it “a turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the programme throughout England by April 2018, the VTVs in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffilde will be among the first to register people and more dispersors will join the programme in October.
Preventive prevention (PRES) is a course on HIV taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that REPs significantly reduce the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When adopting PEP before human sex, a sufficient number of certain drugs are available to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs may be taken daily or at least two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for treatment include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Disployers will take the appropriate participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are not known whether their HIV status is being held back by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practice doctor in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the near venereal doctor participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England has signed a drug contract this week following the international procurement tender.
The study is structured in such a way as to assess all possibilities of PEP for collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its skills and its use on a large scale.
“This crucial innovation must complement and strengthen large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in fighting one of the biggest health threats facing mankind.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Control Agency), stated: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
REPs, if properly targeted by people in need and at risk, provide an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at risk of HIV in England have been able to access the new, innovative means that people can use themselves without discussing it with a partner, which will improve many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “Now, first of all, we need to make sure that the test is rapidly deployed throughout the country and that none of the HIV risk groups are forgotten.
Now that we are provided with the experimental drug PEP, we are going to protect over 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
The Shadow Minister of People's Health, Sharon Hodgeson, said: “We very much welcome the beginning of the REP test; it was very late for months of delays and delays on the part of the Government.”
The data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this rock infection.
This trial will bring us closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PEP.
It is now important that the test be expanded as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people at risk of HIV and to advance us further towards the end of the spread of HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution on support for the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WPC) adopted a resolution that emphasized the importance of retaining presidential positions in the Tatars.
According to the document, the post is “religiously recommended form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and the Tatars.
According to the document, he “has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and social development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
Recall that since 24 July 2007, a 10-year treaty between Moscow and Kazanja has been concluded.
On 11 July, the deputies of Gossoletha Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to retain the title of the head of the region.
Tatar is now the only subject in the federation that has a deal with Russia.
The head of the region is the only post that is called “President”.
There have been difficulties in receiving international driving rights in Russia
HYBDD units experience a shortage of international driving permits (IWDs).
To obtain such rights, a few weeks would have to wait, which would have become a real problem for vacationers who wanted to travel abroad on their own car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains controversial.
The MoU was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as it explained the information in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are also recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In reality, however, everything depends on a specific police or rolling-in office: some require the IDP and others have sufficient national rights.
To meet the challenge, international law operators are still receiving, but it is important to bear in mind that the non-ratification countries (e.g., the United States, Mexico, Indonesia, Spain) do not have the right to recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with forms in almost all HIDD units, reporting to the Commersante, conducting a study in a number of regions.
In Moscow, for example, HYODI units simply do not issue plates, and the forms have been missing for four months.
You can join the public - service site, but it did not take long until mid - August.
In Krasnoarsk, it is not possible to obtain “technically” for technical reasons, without any detail, in the Samarkan region frankly say that there are no forms, and the situation is similar in other cities.
Many Muscovites are already facing the problem, and the following are increasingly being reported in social media:
The Irina of Bourmierst: "Well, guess, why can't we get international rights in Moscow?"
Right, because all HID offices have completed their forms.
Elna Podcolzina: Question of those who know."
International rights must be obtained very quickly.
In Moscow, they have been struck far ahead, and there are no plates at all (which are there, but they cannot be delivered).
I'd like to see the guest portal shows that there's a time free until there's a thing.
Have you ever tried to obtain money in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the requirements for international driving licence forms have changed, and new forms are being shipped to the Gosauvetice.
This may be the case with a deficit, but it is not clear what changes are being made, and it has not been reported.
The Blanca purchases the IT-OBD Road Safety Centre and then supplies them to the HYDBD units.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with AO Ganca: in 2014-2015, almost 200,000 IDP forms were produced, 15,000 were purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with OO-OO-First Printing Court for the manufacture of 70,000 forms.
There's a theory that the CDF just wasn't able to conduct the tender on time, which is why the deficit was created.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: the crisis has caused many people to travel on their own, not to Europe, but to the cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are assumed there are unclear until the end, so people are being re-protected, and so there was a great demand for international “creatures”.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass an examination to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
A new model has been in operation since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Pavel Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
That's on Friday, 4 August, when he told an interview at the Osterster portal.
No distinguished international company will even be placed there because it risks losing its business on the territory of the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia against the Crimea.
"That is, I am convinced that the prospects for this project are actually not," Petrenko said.
He added that he felt Russia was unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller objects.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, whole stadiums are already being destroyed.
“So I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so poor to join this project”, the official said.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the Krim Bridge Road Arch site.
The Krim Bridge Road Arch has completed a thorough assembly on the border bank, which will lock it to a height of 45 metres from the base of the building.
“For one hour the bridge planners prepared to install the rail arch on the fairway side”, reported to the project's information centre.
In April, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, was informed by Mintron Maxim Soklov that the construction of the site was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula to the Krasnodar Land.
In Spain an official who hasn't been to work for 10 years was dismissed.
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) was to be enjoyed by the chief of a Spanish official, Carles Recio?
The permanent walk lasted 10 long years.
On the contrary, Mr. Recio was dismissed.
But not your immediate boss.
What's not going to happen in the world of bureaucratics.
They seem to have been used to all the gears of "public servants" for a long time.
Yet, officials are always surprised to find the people they live on.
This time, the “sanction” has burned from Spain.
There, a staff member in Valencia Karles Resio’s archives learned not to go to work for ten years.
At the same time, he received regular complaints.
It's all Euro50,000 per year.
And now, Mr. Resio's "miracle Times" is over.
He was dismissed by a decision of the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that a violent walker came into the office at 07:00 each morning to appear in the electronic system.
And then I went home.
Once again he appeared in the workplace at 4:00 to be mentioned again in the system that he left.
That's 10 years.
It has also become known that a walker has devoted all his time to drawing comics on the house.
Members of the Valencia Legislative Assembly are now considering how to punish Mr. Resio, the immediate head of the legislature, who could not have known how to “act actively” his subordinate in his workplace.
Judges Offer Protection From the Presidents
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HR Committee proposes limiting the powers of the presidents of the courts and introducing their electivity.
For Courts of Appeal and Cassation, the HRC wishes to introduce special districts that will not be bound by the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals within the framework of a presidential mandate.
The HR Committee has finalized proposals that would strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HR Committee on behalf of Vladimir Putin, on 3 January 2017, and was given by the President after a meeting with the councillors.
The meeting with Council members on 8 December 2016 discussed individual cases of judicial arbitraryity as well as problems of public control in places of detention (see “getting” dated 9 December).
As a result of the work of the HRC, 25 proposals have been made on both the issues of ensuring the independence of the judiciary and identifying judicial errors, as well as the financing of the courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to enhance the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the competition and has received the support of the judiciary, the President of the Court will, in the opinion of the HRC, present him for appointment without the right to refuse, as now the law allows.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the power to assign cases to the judges.
Experts are allowed to do this, and a written computer program may be available.
It is also the view of the HR Committee that the President is not entitled “to determine the outcome of the qualification of the judge, to initiate his involvement in disciplinary action, to decide on the imposition of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to “the election of the Presidents of the Courts by the judges themselves” and to “encourage their powers for a relatively short time with a mandatory rotation”.
All the presidents of the courts (from the Republic to the regional) are now appointed by the President on the basis of a presentation by the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRC proposes that a new appeal and appeal be organized before the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is linked to the administrative and territorial detachment in the Russian Federation.
The HR Committee states that “it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and appeal are organized, not at the regional judicial level, in the Russian Federation, but in the courts”.
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
There are “judicacy districts” that are not the same as administrative divisions in the Russian Federation, but that guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who find it difficult to use “telephone law”.
It is proposed that the justices of the world should be strengthened by the people's sittings to deal with certain “civil and administrative categories”.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, rehabilitation at work, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
“It's just our proposals”, explained the "day" member of the HRC, a judge of the Constitutional Court on the resignation of Tamar Morshova.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only HRC, but also the Supreme Court (SW), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the BC to carry out its mandate (in the middle of the performers, the Gender Prosecutor and the Human Rights Commissioner in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effective the Russian Federation is in ensuring the independence of justice, the President of the SS Váczlislav Lebedev must be until 1 September.
Living a high life: Half-story and cunning design techniques have turned this little apartment into a simple house in Earls Court.
Joan Lee, a former real - estate banker, moved from a vast apartment in Knightsbridge in 2014 to an apartment in Earls Court.
The apartment is on the very first floor of the cute model house in Queen Anna's style, and in favour of the new design, what says is that Joan didn't get his stuff together and moved around again.
"I used to live with my ex-boyfriend at Knightsbridge on a much larger square," says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
They showed me this apartment in Earls Court, and there were these same high ceilings here.
I fell in love with her and offered the same price on the same day."
Since its first visit, 1,000 square feet [1,000 sq m] have been renovated.
Initially, it was an apartment with one complicated design – to get to the bedroom, it had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and half-story to get the most out of the generous ceiling.
"I wanted tall ceilings, big windows, many lights.
Those were my demands," she said.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from an architectural and engineering studio in Notting Hill to use a ceiling of 12.5 feet and to create a home that would not only be a successful project but would be suitable for Joan's life.
The ceiling was not high enough to build two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-story space where full growth could be achieved.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the briefing.
“The steel robots are very complicated”, he explains.
“We had to put the premises above each other and not bend.
It was not necessary to build a simple platform, but to bend the structure so that it would be at the right height and allow space from top to bottom.”
This decision allowed Erfan to build two full - size rooms over one another in the outlying space — and a lot more interesting.
From the semi-story, a lush, copper light window from the Rottroquius opens a view of the magnificent living room below.
Starming furniture with gold strips, silver accents, and elaborate lighting instruments from Serge Muya, swirl the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding vision, space and light.
The short corridor is lined with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirror shield looks like a window to another room.
In the entrance, mirror closets serve to store all Joan's dishes.
In order to create a feeling of more luxuries, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new about the existing kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a sliding door up in the garage.
"There was an engineering event here," Herfan said about an infested steel-walled shield door.
“She's fitted with a counter, so when you push the door up, it's very easy to slide.”
With the reasonable use of storage space and space, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved design.
"In the end, the sex area is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your real estate is estimated to be," Erfan says.
“To put it out, the real estate agent will go in and pay off on the gender side.”
Here they were able to increase the gender area by using quality materials that provide the space for the luxuries.
“The mothers are the things we touch, so they help to create emotional relationships with the home,” says Erfan.
“No one gets in love with a wire in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't touch the strings of our hearts."
This is a testament to the fact that a well-designed and enlarged subway can turn an apartment from something that's normal to something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government has approved the establishment of a Commission on Cultural Policy
The Government of Russia has approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The order is published on the government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission would be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Head of the Commission has been appointed Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitriy Medvedev, approved in 2016 a plan for the implementation of the State Cultural Policy by 2030.
The Plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to increase the impact of Russian culture in other countries, preserve the same cultural space and cultural heritage, and it will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries has fallen to an eight-year minimum
The rise in consumer prices in the G20 countries has fallen to the minimum of eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to data of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent lower than it was in October 2009, when the price index reached 1.7 per cent.
Rosstat had previously reported a decline in Russia's consumer price index of 0.1%.
The agency thus registered the first week of deflation in 2017.
The rate of inflation in Russia is estimated to be 4.1 per cent.
The economy, however, believes that the target is already reached - by the version of the agency - at 4 per cent.
Putin Warning Against Illegal Snacking of Bayaquil Taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during a meeting on environmental development, was warning the natural United States of America against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergey Donsky, noted that a bill had previously been drafted.
It allows logging when fires are destroyed, and the Government is planning to adopt it in the fall.
The President, in turn, said that the project should be kept under review so that the cut “did not go off all the contracts”.
Donsky noted that the bill involves control by the MCS and the supervisory agencies.
Media: WSC elements in secret of command agree with the Donbasa militia
The Donbasa armed conflict line has a regular telephone network.
Opposers are constantly communicating with each other via mobile phones, and this communication is not known at headquarters.
The members of the WSA and the Donbasa militias have established mobile telephone communication in secret from their high command.
This is what Strana.ua reports on 4 August with reference to participants in the military operation in Donbasa.
According to the report, unit commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the other side of the front and are communicating with them by telephone every day.
Communication is not at all home: commanders are trying to reach some “tactical arrangements”.
Part of the result of these conversations is a reconciliation at a certain part of the front line.
Journalists were aware of instances in which an officer had received greetings from the front lines of his formal enemy since his birth.
The members of the WSA and the MFN/LWP militias sit in trenches on the line of separation from the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against the Donbasa.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs instigated the blocking of the UNSF attacks on the Russian Embassy
The Russian foreign political authority is outraged by the actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives, who block the statements of the UN-Sovede in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
At the office it was recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August was subjected to a third shell a month by terrorists from the Hait Tahrr Al-Sham groups (formerly Jabhat Al-Nusra) and Jacob Al-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community is unanimously qualified as a terrorist organization, and UNS resolutions call for opposition to this structure, the FFM stated that “it would seem to be in itself clear that the “Nusra” attacks should meet a general unequivocal and strong condemnation, and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions.”
However, as stressed by the Department of Public Information, “for a third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, France, the United States of America and Ukraine on the United Nations Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of the objections, in support of the alleged lack of information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft statement by the Security Council to the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
Failure to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the consciences of those delegations.
“It is most disturbing that the failure of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts has encouraged them to new provocations and attacks, has given them a sense of impunity”, stated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and added that “it would not be desirable for these barbarians to create a conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them at the same time”.
Vladimir Putin spoke in favour of limiting the number of extra-curricular business checks
President Vladimir Putin, of Russia, during the investment project meeting in the Far East, stated that the number of extra-curricular inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned number and that the duration of inspection should be limited to 10 days.
“Explanatory inspections are generally carried out without proper consultation with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3 per cent are in agreement with the Public Prosecutor's Office; everything else goes on its own” quotes the President of TLSS.
Vladimir Putin also said that it was necessary to prevent investigators from collecting servers and hard disks in businesses.
In addition, according to the President, business associations should be given the right to defend their members ' interests in court.
“This, I hope, will give some impetus to business-related cases or to the violation of the law in the business sector”, said the Head of State.
As reported by the report, other types of inspections by entrepreneurs have increased as a result of the planned audit moratorium.
In May, a survey commissioned by the President of Russia, Boris Titov, found that there had actually been a substitution of the planned checks by non-planetary (the losses encountered had risen from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raiders (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), as well as citizens ' claims (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations ( from 10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
The details of business checks in Little Business walked in on the other side of the paper.
Brothers are fighting for an empire of more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the biggest real estate empires in Victoria, worth more than $500 million, 40 years after their Italian ancestors established a dynasty.
The former Director of the Carlton football club and the builder Colin de Luthíz lives in the Thurk Palace three doors from his little brother Paul, who filed a claim against him before the Supreme Court for division of property and assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court still has a bitter dispute over divorce.
Along with their mother, Anne, brothers own 87 sites worth more than half a billion dollars bought since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew up with 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the de Feb family list now includes office buildings, buildings under construction in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Bank and Mount Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
By agreement with Colin's late father, whom Paul describes as the “main driving force and dominant personality” of the De Luuris family, owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one third of the assets.
According to this court, Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's property is 176 million.
The division of property and money was a stumbling block for Paul.
“The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best portions of property”, he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, following several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the Supreme Court heard its first hearings.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which Paul thought Colin had excluded it.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetence with certain objects.
In Colin's testimony at the beginning of the trial, he said he looked forward to resolving the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider my family the highest priority," he wrote.
Judicial costs are rising as a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports from companies such as Delotte, Pitcher Partners and Charles Keck Cramer are attached to the case; both sides have attracted the most well-known lawyers, including the royal attorney Allan Meyers, and the best of them.
Mrs. De Luuris and her late husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they managed milk bars and gastronoms, and bought shops in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood where Colin opened Colin's first family store of jeans.
Colin says he let Westco go when he was "in the last grades, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna de Luuris says that they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possession to sons without conflict.
"Louijie often told me she didn't want the brothers to sit in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the company group De Feb; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he got out of business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark were “unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL Club and, according to Eddie McGir ' s 2015 curriculum, the best friend of the television set.
Ferfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered by a text message stating that, since the case has not yet been brought before the court, "I have nothing to say in particular."
"I'm very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and fuck the name of our family," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding that "it's still hoping for a solution to the conflict."
On Friday, that hope must have been scattered.
"The decision in our case will soon be delivered by a court of law," wrote Colin.
The new head of Trump is planning to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others have tried to do so and have been defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
Then he'll be the first.
“Policco” reports that the new head of the White House's office plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news stories from the media, hoping to keep the Chief in a calmer state.
This is what the reporter Josh Douzie reports.
"At a meeting held by John F. Kelly, head of the White House on his first day of work, he identified the main issue in the White House of President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels to get information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information was to go through him, whether in paper or through briefings, because the president would be better off taking decisions if he received the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is perfectly correct, but others have already failed in trying to put Trumpa down, tracking the flow of information.
President Trump's relations with television were formed decades ago -- and now, when he's in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
“When Trump was a candidate who resented the unjust coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he received fair publicity in the publications that could be won,” said Sam Nanberg, former electoral staff adviser in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in Polico that "six former members of the election headquarters said that to control Trumpe's habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that the personal information he received was a constant stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing on Twitter has ever been "under control" was funny.
Maybe these election headquarters members know something that we don't know - for example, that if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets Trump never published.
If his staff kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not wasted.
But no one always managed to keep Trump from burning oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Trumpa with material - reliable or not - which confirms their views.
"Policy" -- just to this story -- wrote in May about the propensity of advisers to constantly give the President questionable information.
Here's an example described by a reporter named Shein Goldmeheer:
“The foreign and former officers of Trump say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially with dangerous leaks of information, and will not rest until he finds who was behind them.
That was the case at the end of February when someone put a copy of an article to the President with HotNews.com, the pro-invocator Web site, Charles C. Johnson, in which the deputy head of staff of Katy Wells was accused of standing behind a series of escapes in the White House.
It doesn't matter whether Johnson is forever forgotten in Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he didn't give a concrete account, or that in the past he'd been running false accusations and then he'd given up on them.
Trump read the article and started asking the staff about Wells."
Goldhouser adds that the then head of hardware Rens Pribus and the secretary of machine Rob Porter " tried to build a system to control and document the flow of paper that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Three months later Kelly's been trying to do the same.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has a stimulating disposition, and his assistants continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
The Tumen Public Prosecutor's Office is fighting HIV.
The Public Prosecutor's Office challenged the Kalinininsky Paradise Tumen's ruling, which stopped criminal proceedings against a local woman whose daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died as a result of being an HIV-positive mother and refusing treatment.
However, the Court relieved her of her responsibility in reconciliation with her father.
The Public Prosecutor's Office considers that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to set a precedent for other HIV students.
The case of the Tumeni woman was initiated at article 1, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (a cause of death due to negligence) in April, after her three-year-old daughter had died of HIV infection.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
“A woman has not been treated herself and has refused treatment of her daughter, believing that there is no HIV infection”, explained the Tumen District Prosecutor's Office.
The criminal case was brought to the Kalininian Paradise of Tumen, which decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The request was made by the father of the dead girl, explained that “promote the wife; she had no claim; she was harmed and apologized.”
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office did not agree to the court ' s decision and filed an appeal requesting that the decision to dismiss the case be dismissed and that it be referred for further consideration.
The girl died, and the harm done by the crime was impossible.
The HIV-positive mother, contrary to the recommendations of the doctors, refused to screen and treat the infant with a dangerous infection,” reported to the public prosecutor's office.
In the opinion of the supervisory body, it must be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents follow suit.
According to a report by the Tumen AIDS Centre, about 12 children living with HIV are currently not receiving medical care because of parental denial in the Tumen region.
"And this situation has already improved -- in the year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who have categorically refused to treat their children with HIV have changed their opinions -- allowed diagnostics, took drugs, and told the U.N.
She said that there was no legal way to influence parents and that not all children living with HIV could be detected - mothers were prevented from investigating, hiding, and running with children from hospitals.
HIV/AIDS is at risk
At the end of last year, Russian sociologists presented the results of the first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement in Russia.
HIV dissidents are referred to as people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Health professionals and AIDS service activists call such views anti-medical, and their proliferation poses a serious threat.
An unexpected photo session that ended on Thursday, 3 August, at the Grechna railway station in Hemelnitzka.
A busy company of youths lifted up a bridge over the railways, where the train was just standing.
One of the friends came up with the idea of making an efficient selves on the roof of the car and reported to the FACTAAMs in the police communications sector in the Hemelnica district.
The guy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but because of his carelessness, he stuck behind the power transmission line and suddenly hit the point.
Fortunately, this was the case with the station trainer, who immediately caused the “quickness”.
Before the arrival, the doctors were moved to a safe place and then hospitalized at the Kmelnica district clinic, the hot section of the Kmelnica district clinic.
Males have diagnosed dead body burns from 1 to 2 degrees.
His condition is now measured as stable.
Law enforcement officials recall that in recent times extreme selves have become increasingly popular on the roofs of multiple classes, bridges, transportation.
The police are calling on people to be vigilant and to prevent similar photos, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed oceans to exist in ancient Venus
Oceans could exist in ancient Venus.
That was the assumption made by French scholars.
Experts have set up a computer model that demonstrates the process of creating water on the surface of the planet, writing Science News.
It turns out that at the beginning of its history, Venus had oceans that had 10 per cent more water than now on Earth.
Previously, The Week's Arts said that according to scientists' hypotheses, the ocean could have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
Foreign experts have concluded in their studies that the water facility was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red World.
Three people were injured in a park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured by the shooting and handed over to Associated Press.
An incident occurred in Dolores Park, where a large number of visitors were present.
According to witnesses, a number of men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them took the guns and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the evilrs could not be considered, for they had all but their eyes closed.
Another medical treatment was provided, after which it was released.
A third injured person is a minor, no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park hill is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured while shooting at a night club in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured in an attempt to leave the premises.
Louna rock band will present a new album in Barnaul
The concert of the Louna rock band will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
The musicians will present their new album "The New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The collective is preparing a conceptual show that will become the brightest show in the team's concert history.
The "Diving New World" is the fourth album of the Russian rock band Louna.
His name is linked to the famous O. Hussley Anthitopia O.K.'s "A Strange New World."
The new songs do not deliver the book, but they tell of a society that lives by the law of anti-topia, "the blind belief in propaganda and imposed values."
The students helped collect the album money, and more than 1,200 people supported the project on "Platet.ru".
I released my first album, "Break Grouch!" Louna released in 2010.
Two years later, musicians presented the song "Time X", and in 2013 they recorded the album "We Is the Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, the Louna team played a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the "Peasing for Peace" programme.
In the section of Lusina Gevorkiang (vocal), Vitaly Demienko (Bas gytar), Ruben Kazarian (hytar), Sergei Ponkrainev (hytar), Leonid Kinsbursky (baraban).
The concert will take place at the Faraon Barnául Club on 17 October at 1900.
The price of tickets ranging from 1200 to 2,600 roubles.
Louna is one of the requested groups on the Russian rock screen.
The group was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The group has been defeated on several occasions in different movements of the Chest Dijine H-Parad.
The Roma have overcome the moat and returned to the millionaires' street.
Some of the most wealthy West Midland homeowners are again conflicting with the determined Roma who have been able to overcome the exploitation of the morays by the municipal authorities in order to reoccupy the field close to their homes.
The Tsygans parked 20 homes on their farms in a field bordering the rich street of Solikhalla, a lurid name for millionaires.
They returned with horses, babies and numerous homes on their farms after being expelled from their homes in May, and they were not stopped by the moat, which had been dug by municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defence facilities and opposed its vehicles to a section that was not protected to leave a space for the track.
The angry residents attacked the Solikhalla municipality, saying that it had proved to be “unable to solve the problem”.
The anonymous local woman said, "They came here the evening after they had been driven from Bentley Heth, where they threw stones at the passersby."
Municipalities should be humbled and forced to act because they are completely incapable of solving the problem.
They were here in May, they were chased away, and now they're back.
More gypsies arrived last night, and today probably more gypsies.
“The government of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term rulings to protect their parks”, she added.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't like that I keep paying municipal taxes, and the municipality can't even put an end to this.”
A local resident who wished to remain anonymous said, "It's funny, we just saw these Roma leaving the previous time, and here's the attack going on."
This time, there's more of them, and we've even seen a horse reclining on the meadow."
The representative of the municipality of Solival stated: “We know of an illegal camp on land by the Streetsbrew Road and we cooperate with the Solikhalla police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible.”
To help us gather evidence, it is essential that as many local residents report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by telephone as possible.
This makes it possible to draw up a picture of the situation that will be considered by the court when we present our case to them.
The Kremm takes control of the champagne wine plant "New World"
The Ministry of State of the Republic of Crimees of the Crimean Vinaries of the "New World" has decided to take part in the conversion to the UAO of the "Campanese Wins of the "New World", following the order of the Minister of Property and Land of Crimea Anuquina.
100 per cent of the stock of the enterprise will remain in the hospitality of Crimea.
The joint equity capital will be rouble of 594.5 million and will consist of 5.955 million regular shares at a nominal cost of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if no funds were to be found for upgrading the plant within the next three years, there would be a risk that the plant would stop.
The material contribution to the enterprise is about 60-70 per cent.
The enterprise needs 1.2 billion roubles to be modernized. Because of its specific organizational and legal features, it is obliged to give 50 per cent of its income in the budget.
What remains is not sufficient for the implementation of the modernization plan.
"To get money from the owner is problematic, to talk about borrowing by large credit organizations difficult," said Mr. Cryma Sergey Petlin's superintendent in April of this year.
The Crimean Parliament has incorporated the company into the projected privatization plan for 2017.
It was suggested that the stocking should take place and be put in the tender.
The source of Interfax in the Crimea authorities estimated the likely value of selling an enterprise of $40 million, and the investor's investment in modernization of another $30 million.
The “New World” increased the production of Igritic wine by 2.8 per cent compared with 2015 - 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The site was founded in 1878 by Prince Lvom Golitsinski as a wine-making plant in his New World name.
The plant is located on an area of 11 acres [11 ha].
The lower townsmen, the third class, broke more than 40 tombs
The members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the province of the Region below have identified the citizens who have destroyed 46 graveyards at the cemetery of the city of Liskov.
The third class of students proved to be malicious.
The first statement that the slabs were damaged by unknowns was made to the Russian PLAD on 27 June.
A total of 24 people were sent to the police.
As a result, criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code, “Education, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
The police had identified the suspects as two school girls at the age of 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were curious to see monuments falling, and that led them to boliganism.
Preventive measures have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone of the NGO rescue ships.
Italy warned NGOs who own rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they could not continue to work unless they complied with the new rules governing their activities.
“If NGOs do not comply with the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities”, said Mario Minni, Minister of the Interior, in an interview with the Tunisian daily Stamp.
Minni's warning was given the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, suspected that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had worked for a year, refused to comment on the substance of the detailed charges against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cargoio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is and will remain the highest priority, and we regret very much that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone now," says the statement of the organization in the social media.
“We will be able to assess all the charges made now, only after we gather all the information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities have been following the Juwent vessel, belonging to the Juguend Rette, since October.
His crew is suspected of taking full-blown boats aboard migrants who were sent directly to them and allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting was supposed to have taken place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast - so confirmed in the prosecution material, the contents of which were published in the Italian media.
The Ekipage is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coastal authorities, which control the rescue operations in the zone, rather than of any other reason.
The code of conduct implies, primarily, that the Yuventa vessels will be carried on board a Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to submit to the Code “Stay the Children”, the Maltese MOAS and the “Pro-Activa Open Access” from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they would not result in any “significant changes or interference” in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are the Nobel Prize organization Physicians Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minni said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and to cooperate with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, the Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict”
The FF has recently increased its policy in the Libyan direction, and visits to Moscow have included delegations of opposing Libyan parties.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Librian settlement at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the State Department, the assistant head of the Chechnya Republic, Lev Dayh, told me what the aims of Moscow in the region and at whom the rate is being met.
There is little or no knowledge of the Libya contact group you lead.
Let's say the Ukrainian contact group knows about her.
Here's a cover of secrets.
What do you specifically do, which goals are being pursued?
The Contact Group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activities are managed by the Deputy Foreign Minister, Michael Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Duuma ' s Deputate of Chechnya. "
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan track by the Speaker of the Lord Vácheslav Vladimir.
In September 2015, 11 people were arrested in Libya by the Russian tanker Mechanic Chebotavov (in September 2015 on board).
We thought about helping the crew.
That was when a contact group of military specialists, the representatives of the State Department, was established, and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did it happen that you took the lead?
As I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to chair the group.
Our activities have not been limited to the liberation of sailors from Chebotarev Mechanic.
We have been able to reach out to representatives of all the major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict, and the Tripoli side (based on the United Nations-recognized Government headed by Faiz Saraj. “One) and Tobruk (residence of Parliament which opposes the Government and maintains the Khalifu Haftar march, which is in control of eastern Libya).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Levia-Prime Minister-Hay), we were able to reach a quick agreement on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make better use of these contacts by establishing a contact group.
Its task is to assess the situation, identify key factors and actors, and engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict, and we are engaged in a dialogue with all.
How many are in the contact group, and how many are in Libya all the time?
The contact group now has five members.
Among them are people who have experience in the security forces, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include representatives of the Middle East Institute of Specialists in the region.
None of our personnel are permanently present in Libya, and there is no need to do so.
Whether there are Russian military advisers in Libya now, instructors.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military experts in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group is made up of ex-militarys...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or the cities that are closed up to a certain point for us, such as Misurat (where the militia is based, which played a role in overthrowing Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi in 2011 and which has been significantly strengthened in the years to come).
We arrived in Misurat in January this year.
We were scared, and we were told that it was the Islamists, the terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation ourselves, to examine the real military potential behind which is responsible, why the rumours that are really the role of Islamists are there.
In Misurat, we met all the members of the units that were involved in the destruction of IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this town on the Mediterranean coast was beaten up by fighters prohibited in Russia by the “Islamic State”, “one by one”.
We wanted to see them, to meet those people, to verify that they were the ones who played a crucial role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merit.
And what conclusion did you come to?
The Islamic State in Libya won not Haphtar?
It wasn't him.
The Haphtar was operating on the other front, in Benghazi.
The structures under the Government in Tripoli fought with the IG in Sirte.
And by the way, we've invited people to Russia who've been conducting this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived -- the visit extended from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was admitted to the Federation Council, Duma, MID and Rosgwardi.
You have understood that you are in all Libyan regions and are likely to imagine the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that the ceasefire arrangements, which were reached at the end of July in Paris at Khalif Haftar and Faiz Saraj, will be realized?
Or again, as has happened on many occasions in the past, agreements will be broken, hostilities will be renewed, and the parties will attempt to take over power alone?
It is a good signal to us that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not too long ago.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
As for Russia's position...
Often they write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many of whom believe.
We were faced with this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on board the Russian Air Force Admiral Kuznetsov on that day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurat, they didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave men who came to us today."
But our task is precisely to show that we do not support Haftar alone, we are engaged in a dialogue with all the key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar talked.
Does it make it easier to understand each other with Russian partners at the human, emotional level, the fact that it has been studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haphtar know Russian?
Russian, if he knows, it's pretty much.
But the fact that he has been studying, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way, he's not the only one.
When we communicate with military forces in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak good Russian.
And drifting towards Russia, to some extent, experience nostalgia on it.
Do you consider the imminent lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
We are concerned, of course, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict or want to arm ourselves to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be approximately equal.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling on Russia to assist in some way in lifting it.
The constitutional process is now actively moving forward in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve an internal consensus.
Then the elections are to be held, which was also mentioned at the meeting of Saraja and Haftar.
If the elections are held and the legitimate authority is finally elected (and no party currently has such status), the issue of the lifting of the arms embargo may be raised in the United Nations.
To raise the issue now meaningless and dangerous would only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The media reported on the day that Italy, faced with African refugees coming from Libya, felt abandoned by the EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its connections with the Libyans?
To what extent, for example, is the option that Haftar units control the coast and put an end to the smuggling of immigrants to Europe?
Very timely.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need support from Russia because Moscow is engaged in dialogue both with Haftar and Saraj and with Misurat and from the South.
In that regard, the tribes of southern Libya played a major role, and they were ready to cooperate with Russia.
It is a matter of ensuring that the southern borders prevent migrants from moving forward in a sustainable manner?
I mean, literally, back to the buses where Nigerian migrants go?
That's what we're doing.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to contribute to the integration of southern southern southern southern southern southern southern southern South of the southern borders between Sarajam, Haftar and Haphtar.
But to begin with, we would like to see a unified view on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The Head of Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered Islamist, a supporter of Sharia rules in the country.
How radical is he?
Would it not be an obstacle to developing relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he's, on the contrary, the opponents of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself maintains that Libya must be an absolutely normal country -- a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
How did he get such a reputation?
It was created by countries that were not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where the legislative, executive and judicial power is located.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not getting there.
And we mixed all the cards with them and started actively communicating with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosnepht entered into a cooperation agreement with the Libyan State Oil Company - NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosnephty Igor Sechin made a deal, himself from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first shipment of Libyan oil from "Rosepht".
What will Russia do to her?
I guess I'll resale.
What are Russia’s economic interests in Libya?
In plans to re-sign the contracts concluded at Muammar al-Qadhafi.
These include former transport arrangements (rail-building), energy (electricization) and a number of others.
And the Libyans have anything to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
So, like in the case of Iran, it's an oil-for-service scheme?
I don't know what the diagram will be, I don't really care about these issues.
It's not really Russia's economy in Libya.
We're actually working on peacekeeping.
It is for us to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree so that they can establish order and Libya is no longer an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and driving out terrorists.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries in the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee who said that to date there is no Russian and other former USSR countries there.
He said that he had about 50,000 phone records of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya) and that the Russian speech did not sound there.
And from which States, then, are these fighters?
I would not like to go into these details.
Then the question will be formulated differently.
How many Islamic fighters in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are practically none of the Libyans, not more than 5% of them.
The rest are hilarious.
Could Moscow hold intra-Lebanese talks on the example of Paris?
There are plans.
We are engaged in intensive negotiations with Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have indicated their willingness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
Several visits must take place, and it is hoped that the time and place of negotiations will become clear.
At the Czech Museum, the performers collected money for the expensive gift to the sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Macola, who has MCPT, brain hydrocephalus, and total blindness, will be given a special runway on 5 August.
A useful presentation is given by Sasha, the Minister of Culture of Moscow Region, Oksana Kosarev, and the Director of the Museum of Constantine Bobkov.
The money paid by the trainer was collected during the charity marathon, "Don't give up doing good," which was held in Melchizedek on July 15th, on Chekhov's Memorial Day.
On the eve of a marathon in the museum, they got a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manuskino Czechoslovakia, saying, "I don't have eyes, so I asked my mom to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a ride to make my feet strong, and I'd learn a little bit about walking."
And when Sashina was dreaming!
The "Concept post-scrapptum", a well-known pianist, is being served in the museum and conservation center of Russia, Alexander Gindin, will do his popuries from popular classical works.
During the charismatic marathon in Melchiov, a chorus of the Wiessen Daviva Desert, calls of the Ilya Drosdijin workshop, and students of the Moscow Conservatory of the name of P.I. Chikowsky and the Russian Academy of Greensnikov, artists of the Melikov Theater Theater.
The visitors were auctioned, a book fair and a gift-based gift shop with a marathon logo.
The Milihovo Sanctuary took the initiative to make Chekhov Memorial Day on 15 July the one day of charity for all Podmoskovaya museums.
A 30-year-old resident of Olyska Gitomir district near the local football stadium shot several times in the direction of the adolescents who were there.
According to the suspect, he was alarmed and told by FACTAAM at the police liaison unit in the Gitomir district.
After that, the man entered a nearby cafe.
He had a conflict in the building in which the man used rubber bullets to shoot the man, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old was given the necessary medical care and no threat to his life.
Police and emergency medical assistance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had disappeared by then.
The law enforcement authorities identified him and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man could not explain his actions.
He had a rubber bullets shot-off device that was sent to the examination.
On this point, criminal proceedings have been instituted under article 296 (holiganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces a prison term of 3 to 7 years.
You will recall that in Kiev, an attack was launched on 28 July at a shooting in the Lukjanovska street in Tatarskaya on the night.
Michel Carter's verdict for reports that led to the suicide of Konrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment for using text messages and phone calls that led to the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michel Carter, now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months in prison and another 5 years of probationary life.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on 13 July 2014.
Father Roy said at the hearings on Thursday, "My family is killed in grief.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free before the appeal.
She faced a 20-year maximum, but her lawyers claimed that she and Roy suffered mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and creamy blouse, listened to the sentence of a stand, shook his hands, and let his eyes down.
"By her actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her.
She didn't admit her responsibility," she said.
"She has not shown repentance."
But Attorney Carter said it was “a tragic case of which she deeply regrets”.
Justice Lawrence Monis said, however, that in his view, her “age, maturity or even mental illness have not had a significant impact on her actions”.
The prosecutor read out statements from Roy Lynn Roy's mother saying, "It wasn't a day that I didn't mourn the loss of my dear son.
I want him to be proud of me and of the way I do it -- I try to support his sisters despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy Kamdin Roy said that she was firmly interested in the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or be a aunt of his children.
"The pain that has been with me ever since I was born is the pain that remains with me for the rest of her life," she said.
This case would appear to be a legal precedent, since Massachusetts does not have a law that provides for the responsibility of advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The incident attracted the attention of the whole country when it became known that he had been led to suicide by Carter’s message.
"You can hang, jump from the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know how many ways," she wrote in a few messages sent two weeks before he died while he was resting with his family.
She wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you're going to be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to take care of Roy's death, and he forbade her to communicate with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on the matter were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for killing his British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published his separate opinion in Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Missil Carter deserves sympathy and assistance, not a prison."
I let Langford go like a high-aired bird.
One of the best basketball players in the Single League, Kit Langford, 33 years old, left the UNICS.
U.S. Defense Advocate Izves commented on the President of UNICS Eugeny Bogsev.
Keith made this decision on family circumstances, and told Evgenius Bogsev.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I thought I'd go see him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played at UNICS for three seasons, and in each match he showed a high level, all 100 per cent of them.
That's why I let him go like a high-air bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and in his career.
Keith Langford won a club in Casana for three years by winning the silver of the Single League-2015/16.
During the 2016/17 season, he received the prize of the most effective Euroligic season player ever.
He won 21.75 points on average for the match.
This result has been the second since 2004 when the award was established.
Langford, who won the prize in 2014, was the second player in the history of Europe, who received the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with China's Shenzhen, informing Eurohops.
An American is expected to contract for a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford is going to be the second on July to be the star of Eurolig, which enters a Chinese championship.
Previously, Jannis Bruceis has moved to Chinese CBA for an ex-centre called Panatinicos.
A sun - lit Podmokovya tourist was evacuated by a helicopter in Adigaa
The Adiga rescuers were now evacuated by helicopter from the mountainous region of the Republic by a pumping tourist, who received the worst solar burns.
The man was resting at the Pisht shelter, located at an altitude of 16,000 metres.
A 27-year-old tourist was exposed to pressure and breathing problems.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergy reaction.
The leader of the tour team approached the rescue workers and said that the man's burns were on his way.
Audi to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW, it was suggested that the software should be updated in over 350,000 vehicles.
The Chairman of the BMW stated that the company considered that “there are more intelligent routes than drive restrictions”, with reference to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – which considered the possibility of prohibiting or limiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Damler stated on Thursday that he was modifying three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their step a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers actively promoted diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to assist in the enforcement of carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But nitrogen oxides, which eject diesel engines, are considered to be carcinogens and may cause asthma.
It is also difficult to maintain a competitive car price for the installation of equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gas of diesel vehicles.
While German car manufacturers are under scrutiny, the Government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also accused it of being powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs of the problem.
The companies try not to repeat Volksloveen's mistakes, which hidden the use of so-called “damage devices”, which, during testing, could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules and, under normal driving conditions, shut down.
In the United States, several Folkswagen leaders were convicted, the others being prosecuted on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development team was arrested in Germany.
Former manager, Zakkeo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, and therefore unprotected from extradition, and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subjected to a German criminal investigation involving Volkslovegen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to circumvent European emission regulations and expanded the investigation, which was previously concentrated on the United States.
The inclusion of “Audi” in the investigation could create serious problems for “Folksvagen”: the vehicle manufacturer was the source of a disproportionate share of the income of “Folkswagen”.
In Astrachia, a Café visitor paid for false money
A report was made to the police by a bank official that a cash transfer had been made from the public hospital by a suspicious purchase unit of 5,000 roubles.
A study at the Centre for Expert and Criminalism found it to be false.
According to the Russian UVD on the Astrahan district, a visitor to a coffee shop bought a shaurma.
It should be noted that the cashier was not equipped with a means of identifying the merchant's authenticity.
Currently, police officers are assigned to deal with the manufacture and marketing of a fake CB RF ticket.
Such offences are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years, with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Oversight Services calls on residents of the Astrahan region to be accountable for financial transactions; it is recommended that workers of the facilities be equipped with instruments to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a "Adian" planet that can even float on iron
For the first time, the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b had been examined, astrophysicists were quite surprised at its temperature, which was able to vaporize iron and other metals.
Experts have noted that water molecules are so heated by the light of a star that infrared radiation is emitted.
The Hubble telescope has sealed the graying of water molecules on this gas hyganate, causing high temperatures in the atmosphere of the planet to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "heating maters" - gas giants, by size and mass, comparable to the largest solar-system planet system, but situated dozens closer to the parent star.
As a result of this year, the exoplane is only 1.3 "land" days, and its gas shell is nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit [2,500 ° C].
Climate change is threatened by lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but there are now concerns that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has grown worse because of dry weather and insect - borne diseases; this has caused the constant headache of scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Shes, an expert from the CREPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says, "Lavand is in real danger because in recent years this plant has been experiencing the effects of climate change: the spring and particularly the fall of rain have become much smaller.
This has an impact on the life expectancy of lavanda.
And there are some little cicadas that leap through the leaves by insects carrying microbacteria, and there are a great deal of them in very dry weather."
There are many things at stake.
Lavanda is not only a holiday; lavender oil is very much used for perfume and cosmetology.
Eric Schasts says, "We have small, undeveloped, weak, or missing, instead of very long skins with many large flowers.
So we have fewer ester oils."
The decisions currently under consideration include improved distribution of water and the slowing of evaporative water from soils, as well as the spraying of plants with protective mixtures of clay and water and the removal of varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador Winter Universale (2019 met with a number of red-headed school girls
The world's two-time hockey champion, Ambassador of Winter University-2019 Alexander Samin, met the day before with the new hockeyists and distributed autographs to the fans.
The meeting was held at the Winter University in the course of the thematic week of the Shaibah hockey.
Any visitor to a tent could ride on horseback at an artificial ice yard.
In addition, essays, Victorias, and games with the play of gift student products were organized, as was the difference between aerobic federations.
Fifty students attended.
Alexander Simeon encouraged the boys to do as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing in the early stages of education is hard work and a great deal of hockey.
"It's good that there's a space in Krasnoarska, such as a tent of Winter Universidad-2019, where start-up athletes can ask directly questions to team coaches," said the champion.
Let's just say that students' sports and healthy lifestyles are being promoted among the redheads by the Winter Universal War Ambassadors.
The Universidad Shater will work throughout the summer season until 25 September, reporting a press management service for the Winter Universal Nations-2019.
In Gosdep, they commented on Medvedev’s words
The official representative of the United States Department of Public Prosecutions, Heather Nauert, commented at the briefing by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, on the need to find areas to interact with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found to “ensure bilateral interaction”.
An example of such successful cooperation, Nauert, described the Syrian Armistice Agreement.
We are two nuclear super-Powers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
However, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev ' s assertion of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, of course, she has the right to speak, but I can't say anything else," said the representative of the State.
In the past, U.S. President Donald Trump had signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on a new package of sanctions, the Head of Government of the FF Medvedev stated that Washington had declared a full trade war in Moscow, ending the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that U.S. sanctions would be in force for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes that the U.S. artifact “clean play” of Trump.
Those missing in Podmoscow bodibilder were found on someone else's gift to those who lost their memory.
Bodibiler Shamel Huntethov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very peak circumstances: he left the cabin of a car to go to the toilet.
Seven days he was unsuccessfully sought out by acquaintances and local residents.
And Shamel's been on a strange date in Ramanski.
He was totally naked in his master's room.
The Dagatian athlete could not explain what happened and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was gone.
Personally, announcements of his missing have helped to establish his identity.
The medical personnel who arrived at the telephone recorded a partial memory loss and a brain injury at Hanmeta, a message to the Mash staff.
Probably there are other surprises waiting for the athlete.
The perpetrators of Shemil were likely already in his apartment, whose keys were also stolen.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion roubles
The oil and gas revenues generated as a result of July 2017 actually exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, reported by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to rouble, explained to the agency, was higher than the average monthly value of June used for assessment, as well as the excess of actual gas production and petroleum exports of projected levels.
“The rejection of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate in accordance with the Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected to be +40.2 billion in August 2017”, states the report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The total amount available for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is, therefore, 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency would amount to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the procurement of foreign currency.
Each working day of the year the CB will enter into transactions for the purchase of foreign currency at the organized biddings of the Moscow Exchange on an equal footing during the trade day.
The acquired foreign currency will be charged to the Federal Treasury in Central Bank.
The journalist's murder emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The weekly newspaper Riodose usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss plans for reporting recent violent crimes in Sinaloa, related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, devastated by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed to be safer: taking the children with them into the office where the grenade had already been dropped in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote on the room board, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name the names for each column - no evidence needed, no suspicions and internal feelings enough.
They are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being in the possession of a government or cartel, and they're a number of silhouettes that make it dangerous for the education of chaos in Mexico.
Violence is far from taking its toll, and more and more of the number of bodies in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, no less than 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people were killed in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and initiator, co-founder of Riodose, Javier Valdés Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdes in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is everywhere - a large photograph of Valdez showing the middle finger, with the inscription of “Justice” hanging on the front of the Riodose building; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, have t-shirts showing his smile, face in the eye or his commercial pan.
The seminar is held less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was organized in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated, according to the Committee for the Defence of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of drug-related and organized crime-related murders each year, journalists are rarely tried.
The journalists, Riodose, insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, even though they are killed by grief, although they're more dangerous around now.
Without information about the killers, without justice to talk about security at the meetings, Ibarra says.
"Very foolish to waste time at this seminar," he said.
"until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the Riodose office in Kuliakana, capital.
He was able to travel only a few blocks before his red Toyota Korolle was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of his car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twenty River".
The shotman left on his car and crashed it close by.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two grown children.
Hearings usually vary rapidly through the Kuliakana.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
Let us not say that every day one or more people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with painted double-eded mausoleums, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Let's just forget for a moment that a calm condition is just when one of the cartels takes control of the maritime state, with important ports and drug lines that lead to U.S. drug trafficking.
Despite this and the fact that Valdés was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was guilty of his failure to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso López, the leader of one of the rival cartel factions fighting Guzman's sons.
The publication might have made sons angry; people who were allegedly members of a gang had bought up all copies of the publications as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper was seized and written about the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was viewed as a regular milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Neroeste, and in 2003, he, along with five colleagues, founded Riodos, sold his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without affecting the subject of drugs," Bhorkes said.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publications, sales, and advertising.
Journalists liked to be able to publish bold reports, not for fear of censorship, but for readers, that they could read about what they no longer dared to write.
Eight years after its founding, Riodose received the prestigious Maria Murs Kabão Prize for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdés won the International Press Freedom Prize for the courage to investigate Mexico's drug trade wherever it may be.
He openly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ Prize.
Sinaloa's drug trade is "this way of life," he said last October in an interview with Romieento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks you have to face, whether you're a journalist or you're just a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around me... why didn't you say what's going on?"
Riodose staff members miss Valdes, a fool who fought like a cargoer in port, a friend who's generous in arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to sleep alive.
They trusted in the order they had set for them.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar in front of the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they're asking, "Did he lose love for the order that's been established?"
His death caused them both to wonder about their best way of doing their job and staying alive.
“They don't like when you're interested in their wives, children, in their legal business and in underground airfields for drug transport.
"These things were over the line," Bhorkes said.
The result, even in better times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-protection.
We have to believe our instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
Problem, says Andrés Villaral, editor of Riodose, that "absence can be deceived... and then what happens to Javier."
The old rules, he says and others, no longer operate in Sinaloa, as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there are poisonous mixtures of profitable smuggling routes, weak State institutions and corrupt officials.
The Landschaft is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodose staff had gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to enter cell phones: a few days earlier, it had become known that spying programmes, which were sold exclusively to Governments, were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
Two police officers have hidden in the shade of the wood from the 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the state government to protect Riodose's office, which is located in a four-story building in the Kuuliakana quarter of the burg city.
Some journalists, half of whom were asked if these police officers included 50 percent of the order that the Governor himself had said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous, de facto place under the control of drug gangs.
In the nearest Riodose, there were three main themes.
This is the murder of a former champion's brother, Julio Cezar Chávez, in Sinaloa.
They also had government expenditures concentrated in the governor ' s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Kuliakana's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who had been abducted or how it had happened, so it was necessary to exercise caution when it was time to write down that all in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant both of the drug dealers and the authorities.
One of their journalists learned from the open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling institutional revolution party (PRI), which dominated all levels of power over the past century.
Recently, a number of governors from PRI were accused of corruption.
Villaral asked journalists to write about the previous incidents at this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Guzman left the arms of the military.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdez's column with the most reliable information on kidnapping.
"We'd know what was going on," says 46-year-old Villaral, for his thinest carpenter, El Flacco.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdés Cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and dockers protesting the murders of journalists, because staff members have become someone they never thought they'd become, in the name of the press activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramírez took several posters and went to the local prosecutor's demonstration on another journalist the next morning.
El Salvador Adam disappeared in the state of Michoakan in the west three days after Valdez was killed.
A burnt body was found, and the authorities said it was based on DNA tests.
In all parts of the country, journalists have spoken louder, organized protests and written SOS Press on sidewalks and house walls.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., seeking international support for the requirement of justice in the Valdes case.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez Ramírez, the authorities accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then requested that she not give her more tasks to highlight the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdés used to say that the journalists in Mexico were “circumcisioned” of organized crime, its partners in the Government and the indifferent society.
In his last book, The Drug Journalist, he wrote that reporters were not just killed by drug gangs; they were doing so at the orders of politicians and security agencies in conspiracy against organized crime.
The Articolo 19 Press Protection Committee believes that half of the attacks against journalists last year were under orders from the police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez says.
Of course, people are afraid of murder.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body found a note supposedly written from the face of the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
Computer keyboards and headphones were next to her cut head.
Some publications have chosen to close up like El North in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Brić was murdered in March.
Others continue to stand as El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo following the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diyario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed the drug cartels through a drafting article on the first page entitled “What Do You Want From Us?”
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile and they are still exposed to danger in the streets.
They are sometimes killed, as was apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 with four women in a Mexican apartment three months after he fled Veracrosa.
Those who remain and continue to work have a daily balance between risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he's afraid of writing about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, which is why I became a journalist," he said.
Last Friday, midnight, when the final issue was ready for press, the publishers of Riodos were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when their phones rang at once.
A series of firefights between rival gangs and security forces near Masatlan resort left 19 dead bodies behind.
The war continued to unfold, as promised in a series of letters from cartels found in the area.
On the sidewalk, they put news on the Riodos website via their mobile phone.
The next day, we had to translate the first page.
There were sirens in the subsoil, another gunfire in the vicinity.
Bohorkes was looking at whether the police guards in charge were ready for defense.
If they were scared, they didn't show it at all.
Siting under a huge portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was displayed to cover the whole of Sinaloa, Riodos continued his case.
"How can you think of closing," said Bohorkes, "if the very day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street to report?"
Dinosaur used mosquitos to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, though a frightening one.
The researchers reported that the first remains found of an incredible substance, sized from rhino discovered by a Canadian miner, remained so well that the experts called it "Mona Lisa Among Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his skin was red brown and brown — and to say that he had, in some way, “the dark past”.
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the most well-established find and one of the best singles in the world”.
It is a fossil — a newly discovered copy of the nodosaur, living in the middle of the shallow period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition was brightened by researchers who call him “really remarkable”.
The most well-established herb in history, according to the articles in National Geographic magazine, is this herb.
He was found by Sean Fank when he worked at the fall of the Millenium mine of Sankor near Fort McMurrey in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from nature and decided to look more carefully.
The fossil record was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Plyeontology.
For the next six years, work was done to locate an animal inside the earth’s deep depth of 2,500 feet (1,100 kg).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the completed outcome can be demonstrated.
“It's only a little a little bit of a touch, and it's almost true that he's sleeping”, said the leading author, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrellow paleontological Museum, where the creation is shown.
“It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-established copies of the dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.”
In their study of his skin, researchers found that he was a herbalist, even though he was covered by a pancreas and was reminded of a walking tank, they seemed to have been exposed to considerable dangers by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The dinosaur, covered by a powerful pancreas, used a red and white mosquito to hide from predators and used protective equipment known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to join the environment more quickly and avoid encountering enemies, assuming that larger dinosaurs were hunting him.
This is a 110 million-year-old creature belonging to the Nodosaurov family, which was widely covered in the press in May, and is now at an exhibition in the Royal Tyrells Plyeontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and given it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli, in honor of the Mark Mitchell Museum Laboratory, one of the team members who spent more than 7,000 hours digging.
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the shies and pancreas on his body.
They found a protective colour, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the lower side was darker than the lower side.
Although colouring is common, the discovery is surprising because the Borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than the existing protected animals.
It may be assumed that this dinosaur has been the target of damscene dinosaurs, that evolution has preferred the masking of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the modern animals with protective colors – deer, zebras, or bronzes — are much smaller and more accessible — indicating that the nodosaurus has had to fight hard to survive.
“The serious threat posed by predators to massive, massive-covered dinosaur puzzles shows how dangerous the Meln's predatory dinosaurs were,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the Chischi dinosar also indicates that its skin was to be red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the contents of his digestive tract that he had to eat during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was carried into the sea, where it sunk and its back fell down to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans are likely to have spread much farther inland than now.
“This nodosaurus is indeed noted by the fact that it covers the leftover scaly skin, and at the same time it is fully preserved in three dimensions, while maintaining the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked back then, in the fallacous period.
You don't have to use imagination in particular to restore it, you just have to feel a little bit, and you can almost believe that it's sleeping."
The small period is an age when giant terrors, wild dinosaurs on two legs wandered across the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the Tyrannosaurus of the river, lived a million years later than Borealelta, Tyrephorus could have been hunted by one of his formidable ancestors.
These include the acrocantosaur, a 38 - foot [1.5 m] - long monster that weighs six tons.
Scientists whose recent discoveries are published in Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after death and mumified in the background.
The property was found by Sean Fank when he worked in Millenium Mine near Fort McMurry in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum staff, this is the most well-established Tyrophorus in the world, along with the skin and the pancreas, and he's whole, from the face to the bones of the femur.
On average, these were approximately 18 feet (5 m) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Their characteristic was the two 20-inch spikes of the shoulder.
The researchers believe that this herb of herb was a difficult step after being Canada's right now until it was brought into the open sea by a spill of river.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his shell with accuracy to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular instance are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the burgeoning shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
According to Michael Graszko in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of security as "other as winning a lottery."
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossil remains of the skin still cover the bungly pancreas of the animal’s skull.
His right fore leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it stretched upward.
I can count on his ass."
Michael Saakashily managed to reach Poland without papers
Mikhail Saakashivi, formerly head of Georgia and then the region of Odessa in Ukraine, arrived in Poland.
In doing so, he did so without documentation of his identity and nationality.
Saakashily's arrival reports to the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which placed a video on his YouTube channel with his presentation.
Saakasville gave a presentation on the anniversary of the Warsaw insurrection against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking that language, he had to speak English through an English interpreter.
During his speech, the politician touched on Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland and also on Ukraine.
About the fact that Ukraine's migration service had deprived its nationality, an opportunist learned from his stay in the United States.
How he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is not yet known.
The former Governor of Odessa, Mikhail Saakashili, stated that his signature on the questionnaire to obtain Ukrainian citizenship had been counterfeited.
Politician stressed that he had not completed any questionnaires.
The investigation period in the Weinziheer and Olkhukik case was extended until January.
The duration of the preliminary investigation into the Renov group owner of the company Eugion Olkhyuk and the head of the power hall, T Plus, Boris Weinzicher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court considers the extension of the accused ' s house arrest.
The representative of the UK reported on the last decision to extend the preliminary investigation.
“The particular complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need to withdraw and evaluate a large number of documents, as well as to carry out investigative activities in the territory of several FM entities”, the investigator stated.
He added that suspects regularly bribed the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzicher, Olkhik, as well as Mikhail Slobdin, former head of the OU, who led the Wimpel Company until 5 September, bribes were passed to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi for the imposition of maximum favourable rates for heat and electricity, as well as for the creation of a favourable business environment.
Weinziheer and Olkhik were detained, staged in the Sticovcar and arrested for two months, Slobdin was taken away from the investigation and announced a federal search.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question “The streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was heartbroken.
Only a day after arriving in New York, St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an airbnb apartment, watching the Facebook tape on the phone.
She attacked someone from high school.
It said, "The police have just killed a 18-year-old and he's still in the middle of the street."
Noting that no one else on her tape had taken this information, puzzled, she closed the Facebook and opened the Twitter.
Her tape had many user posts with @TheePharoah.
A real-time rapper from Greater St. Louis reported the death of Michael Brown, a unarmed black, eighteen-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's lifeless body, spread out in the street where it would be four hours.
“It's wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put off her phone, and later in the evening, she returned to tweet about the fact that people are going to Kenfield Drive.
There were photographs of the signal tape and of the shouting people and the man who claimed he was Brown's father, who said, "Ferguson's police officer has just killed my unarmed son."
She's been watching a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protestors with a swearing dog.
"I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
"It's an unstandard situation," according to memories, Ferrel said then.
“It's not like killing is what we're used to and what we can call typical.
At that point, I felt tired.
I was angry and cried."
She took a return ticket and left home the next day.
When she landed at 11: 00 a.m., she took her six - year - old daughter from her father's house and decided that they both would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson over the next nearly three years has become the subject of a new documentary film entitled “The streets?” that will appear on the screens of 11 August.
These are accounts of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and resilience in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets, asking for answers.
While Ferrel was driving to Ferguson with his daughter dressed in a flowered dress and a flowered crown, they remembered a conversation that had led a number of times before this morning “on the experience of the Blacks and on their condition”.
She remembers saying: "Do you remember when I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We're about to go to Ferguson, because a police officer killed a 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
'I couldn't take her,' said Ferrel later.
"What happens today is the culmination of what happened before.
She must know about it, see that, and be brought up for it.
It must not only be well understood in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of the Blacks and their situation and what we must do to be free to be released.
Even if I can provide her with a environment in which she will not personally face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel I would have given her a bad favor if I had driven her away from it."
When they arrived at Ferguson, the first stop was on South Ferrissant Road, on the road from a police station like a tent camp while activists were waiting for reports of the final innocence of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrel joined the local business company with his daughter, who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped to distribute them to the protestors.
A new kind of activist is gradually taking shape in Ferrel's mind.
“My activism changed completely after 9 August”, she said, noting that, as a student at the University of Missouri-Saint Luis, she was the President of the Association of Sanitarian Students, Representatives of National Minorities, and engaged in food justice and health inequality in black communities.
“I didn't have any experience with the organizer.
This came about on its own.
A few weeks later, Ferrel met Saba Folayan, one of his fellow directors.
Folayan said that she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, had “just wanted to document” the events.
Ferrell came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story that you can play with?"
This scepticism has been celebrated by numerous people, often white, who have come to the community to benefit from his pain and resilience.
“We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not in the focus of attention, and we wanted to do so otherwise, ” explained a recent interview by Folayan.
Folain had already merged with his associate Damon Davis, a local artist known for his death row activist.
His participation was encouraged by Ferrel's sympathy for the project and by six other local residents with whom the project "The Whose Streets?" had been connected over the years since the Brown murder.
“This documentary doesn't speak for us or us, we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was the most important thing for me to see these people, because it's the way I'm going to present it.”
Although the project did not focus on Ferrel's experience at all, it was in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the recipient leader but about how the community is united”, as Folayan said, that it was the most open film audience.
As a result, there are suddenly personal aspects of Ferrel's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, laughing at the first time when she saw the finished product.
“But I realized that if you were doing such work and dehumanizing black people there must be some level of vulnerability.”
Furthermore, Ferrel's story has been discussing and emphasizing the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Life movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - those who created the tag #BlackLivesMatter in social media after the murder of a black youth named Trevon Martin in 2012 - are treating themselves as homosexuals.
“Church homosexual women in leadership positions support this movement, ” says Ferrel. “And all because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folain accepted this assertion, noting that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and a multitude of homosexual black women”.
Nevertheless, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrel was not elected the central character of the film because of its distinctive characteristics.
"She was the man who lost that energy," she said.
“ On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that it’s on the first hand because when ”
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the film camera in Ferguson has been gone for a long time, but the racial links between the community and the police remain complex.
A further two and a half years will be on probation for closing the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called a house simply: Barack.
She's still holding on to a speech that she learned when she walked out on Ferguson's three-year-old streets.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualifyd for the bite of U.S. players
El Salvador's gathering of Henry Romero and Darwin Seren has gained long-term dissociation for unreserved behaviour.
At the 4th Grad Cup of North Central American and Caribbean Cups (CONCAAF), Salvadorans bitten American players.
The first was the lawyer Henry Romero.
El Salvador bitten the attacker, Josie Altidor, after which it pinched him to his chest.
Then Seren, a para-protector of the U.S. Ombudsman, bitten the coal in his fine area.
As a result, Romero was disqualified into three matches, and Seren was disqualified into six.

Similarity: an artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
There's a white, black, and brown, all of a sudden look on each other.
These 30 portraits were created by hisser Dewey-Harborg, an artist, with brushes and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Levenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year term for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called the Origin of Similarity.
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, information and art, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama reduced his sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
After examining the computerized DNA programme from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people with a genome like that, Dewey Harborg created a deep, although difficult, manifesto on how to understand the DNA data, the different ways of interpreting it and the integrative determinism of these interpretations, but also the concept of identity.
Manning, born with the name Bradley Edward, but from an adolescent age, had openly said that he considered himself a woman, had been sentenced in 2013 to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Spying Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs in the prison were not available, so that only one of her photographs was known: the grainy black and white selfi, where Manning at the platinum wall of the parlour, clearly awkward, was driving the car; with this photograph, she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg completed with great success its 2012 project, "A Visit to Strangers".
In it, an artist created portraits of unknown people by means of a judicial evidence of the type of shell and gem, removing the DNA from that garbage and creating images of how these people could look.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They took an interview from Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey Hagborg at a preliminary display of the new press exhibition.
At that time Chelsea was not to be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait from her DNA.
In this way, her artist and her prison muse became friends in correspondence and exchanged letters for two years.
They even wrote a book from the comic books "The Suffocated Images," illustrated by Shoili Canngo, who illustrated how the President would in the future ease Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book was released was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in the military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and strong about the fact that the exhibition opens itself right now when Donald Trump declare war on people who reveal classified information in the government and invents new ways of inflamming the enemy he's supposed to soften in Twitter.
When Dewey Harborg was asked about this coincidence just over time, she said, "It doesn't happen."
In a statement by an artist on the gallery wall, a huge signature by Manning at the bottom (as opposed to the "i" point in her name) calls for an end to the “auto-distinguishing division based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the other side is its mitochondrical DNA, which is a long caterpillar of pencil C, G and A.
After including 200 letters (or nucleotides, like a scientist in science), Dewey Harborg hoped to show us how we all resembled, in any case by our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn't determine what we are, how open genetic data are to interpret and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; its 2007 video production, "False Memories", is also displayed here.
"The DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibit in one room is the above-mentioned comic book novel.
It's where Manning comes over the U.S. Correctional Building with a loudspeaker in her hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it is written there.
"This is why don't you ever shut up."
'This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me,' says the artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I still have skin-skins when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person - like the pictorials were depicted in comic books - but when she comes, she'll be welcomed by the masks in the center of the room, her own genomes, gathered together like a crowd of protestors.
It's also done purposely, like everything on the exhibition up to a height (5'2), Manning growth, which has had genetic units drawn on by the pencil.
"I'd love them to look like a crowd of people earlier," says Dewey Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea as the movement that was standing for her release."
Professor of North-West University and staff of Oxford University are looking for police on murder charges
According to the police, there is a national raid on the Northwest University Professor and an Oxford University officer who are wanted as suspects because a man is trapped in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the records of the Cook District Court, on Monday arrest warrants were issued for pre-inducted murder, without the right to bail for a 40-year-old, Windem Latham, and for Andrew Warren, 50-year-old, in connection with his alleged involvement in the death of Trentton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, 20-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after he had been injured multiplely.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was found on 27 July.
The police came by, came to Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Durallo was declared dead at the crime scene, and now detectives are investigating the death of the stabbing wounds, considering her as a murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Latham served as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the North-West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabage, Vice President of the University of Relations, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was prohibited from entering North West University campaigns.
“It is now a criminal case that is investigated by authorized persons, and the University of North West is cooperating with the investigation,” said Cabbaj.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement, “We have communicated with the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the US investigative authorities”.
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
The police chief, Chicago Anthony Gulelli, said that he strongly advised suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” told Gulelmi.
According to Gullami, local, regional and federal authorities help in the search for suspects.
According to Gullamy, the police called the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who has just received mysterious reports of something that happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene terrible.
Gullami reported that it was unclear whether the incident itself had occurred on 27 July.
He said that the camera records confirmed that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had relations,” said Gullami.
The Grand Plaza Manual issued an appeal to the residents, saying: “At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of reasons, including a possible domestic accident”.
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko: "We will comply with the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future."
Russian Vice-Prime Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said that the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) conditions set for the resumption of work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would soon be met.
“A certain stage in meeting the requirements has been reached, RUSAD has been given the authority to plan and run tests together with UKAD (United Kingdom anti-distorting agency).
WADA's road map was accordingly updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map on the restoration of the status of compliance with the Code, which enumerated the modalities for the resumption of RUSAD and had recently been published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could have imagined difficulties for Russia.
"All was announced, all to be accomplished.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and VADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements listed on the list implies that Russian Andidoping Organizations must publicly accept the results of the inquiry commissioned by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who claimed that the doping in Russian sport was State-controlled.
On this point, Mutko said, "We're conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programmes, and we will not acknowledge what was not.
Mutko echoed the words of Vitalia Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian Rport, Smyrnov acknowledged previous problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We used to say on several occasions that the report contained certain controversial positions and provisions.
"No one else is going to accept this report without question," added Smirnov.
WADA has prevented RUSAD from carrying out pre-ping controls in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization's Moscow office in July, the Director General of WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSAD was “moving in the right direction” to rebuild his work.
Fire extinguished in the 79-year-old tower of Dubai
The heavy fire that took place in one of the highest housing buildings in the world, the Tower of The Torch, has been reduced, transmitted to Reuters.
Firefighters are said to be able to cope with all fires by four o'clock local time (3.00 msk).
The local authorities reported that no injuries had been sustained as a result of the incident.
At the time of the fire, the streets adjacent to the sky were closed.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
It has been reported earlier that in Dubai, a 79-line dwelling space called The Trust, which is one of the highest buildings in the world.
All the residents were evacuated on time.
The incomparable sight of the Bozoic shaking of the worshipers: pants that do not cover the panties
The scandalal reality show "Dom-2", Olga Bozoza, struck the viewers of the Europa Plus Live Festival with panties.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, the newly discovered singer a duet with Nasta Kudri filled the song "We Will Be Warmly."
The two girls went on stage in provocative "brunes" sewn up in such a way that they saw their underwear.
The inscriptions of Buzova and Kudry were made on the pants.
In the past, it has been reported that changes in the outside of Bouzoma were commented by a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, 4 August, by Radio 4 News Service, with reference to foreign media.
He said that it was the Russian authorities who were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and the “destabilization in the east of Ukraine”.
Stoltenberg assured, however, that dialogue with Russia was possible and that further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, President Donald Trump of the United States stated that the relationship between the United States and Russia was at a dangerously low level, and he accused the American Congress of doing so.
Metro Ekaterinburg is learning a new way of paying
In October, Paul Vedernikov, the director of the OA-I-Stet, will be able to pay a bank card in ekaterinburg.
Our goal is to introduce the same system of travel in the subway World Cup in 2018 as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want the fans from other countries, the guests of the Mundilla, to use the metropolitan system with their bank cards, and not to get their tokens or to be in line," he said.
The startups that will help your company not to become another Uber.
Amy Herrett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the staff of his startup in the area of electronic commerce, but the interviews did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, unscathed.
And even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He has never been consistent and objective”, said Herret, managing a 75-person company in San Francisco, Madison Red, an electronic trade in hair care.
So she turned to others for help.
There is now a new mode of startups in the area of personnel, which assists companies to find out how their staff are feeling.
By developing and licensing a software that is intended to measure staff participation, they allow companies to make express requests, to approach certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases to allow top-management informers to pass through and to take direct action.
“Now we have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City startup, whose analytical programmes are used by companies to measure staff participation.
Errett told me that she had reached a better understanding of what her staff thought and felt in three years of using Glint.
In addition to the express questions and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in visual form what units have more complaints and which managers have a low rating of approval, which allows them to understand why.
Companies are suddenly aware that they need to control the workplace, or they will become another “Uber” involved in a scandal when a former staff member published a post on a blog that described an aggressive environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like Glint, it's a desire to control the situation, a chance for a profit-making business.
According to the Internet portal Payout Talk, dedicated financial technologies, global governance, regulation and compliance could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Evercent Star of Denver, Colorado, helping companies to prevent and detect bad behaviour, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year, against the backdrop of the fall of the reputation of the Uber.
Almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tsla, are in the Convercent.
Recently, the Web was among the clients.
As with “Glint”, “Concontent” allows companies to send individually commissioned staff opinions, collect confidential real-time responses and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages, which allows staff members to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go right to the headmaster.
“The law of public opinion has overpowered the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinn, founder and president of Convercent.
If it is found that the company mistreated staff or behaves immorally, even if the inspector does not intervene, the company may face costly consequences as boycotts by clients, outflows of staff and legal actions, reported Quinn.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants where there are more than 25,000 employees in 500 institutions, used Evercent for over a year to make sure that staff members are aware of the rules and procedures, and to offer a simple way of accessing the company's main office.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or a email of the head office, file a formal complaint and hope that it would not be seriously addressed.
Often it was a frightening and awkward experience, reported James Vitrano, the head of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way of tracking staff complaints.
Now, when a company uses Convercent, the problems previously hidden from offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, strife and unfair pay – can be discovered and dealt with more quickly.
“I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff”, said Vitrano, who runs the Ruy Tuesday risk management team.
“And we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings with staff members.”
According to Queensland, companies began to take a more serious view of the ethics, values and authority of the staff in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen had failed due to ethical irregularities resulting from Dela Enron.
But as soon as “social networks were spread,” companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty laundry away from the virus on the network.
“How do we start using technology to control ethics people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, paying regular fees from companies for their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Evercent received $10 million from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tela Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Blamer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interrelated nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's staff expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In markets with fierce competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, it is only the minimum necessary.
Staff members want to feel that they are being received and appreciated and that they are spending their time with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, feel that they are being heard, and that the work they are doing is producing results, they are more successful,” says Nina McCuin, vice president of global benefits and satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors get income when the companies in their portfolio do well; the business of the companies goes well when the staff are committed and engaged.
While third-party analytical tools promise to increase staff loyalty and commitment, it is not surprising that they find support.
Workplace cultural professionals argue that it is important to have data on staff membership.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback, it may give the impression that the change is coming.
And if change does not come soon or quickly enough, frustration may develop, and staff members will lose interest.
“If you're going to ask 4,000 proposals, you're ready to hold 4,000 interviews”, says Russell Ratt, president of Lotter International, who had to see companies make a mistake with too much reliance on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will think, 'Do you really hear me?
Don't you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly staff surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports a problem with Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from staff who were unhappy with decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge of its staff and hopes that in the long run, it will be able to retain staff more effectively in a highly active industry.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose company.
In Barnaul, they open up a new asphalt on the Krasnoarmaya Avenue.
In Barnaul, decisive steps were taken to address the causes of the asphalt failures at the Krasnoarmaya Avenue.
The place where the pits appeared twice on the newly grounded carriageway (the young woman's street sitting) decided to "cover."
Remember, a small section of the road near the tramway was hit by the fact that the land in the area of the unexploited network.
According to Ivan Garmata, the Vice-Chair of the City Committee on Road, Health, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be conducted for detailed survey and the elimination of the prerequisites for the violation.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that a re-establishment and concrete of the impregnable communication deck will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the capital city.
Team Brewings has to do longer because the National student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day
The time is approaching 11:00 a.m.; a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles is being delayed to chat on the one side of the new training fields of the team on the compass.
Some of them have dragged their t-shirts off, found their backs shining from the sweat after a busy first day at a sports camp.
For many of the team, these moments of idleness take a mid-day break.
After three hours of training, the players will go back to their homes to prepare for final examinations and return to the Wassermann football centre the next morning to attend meetings at 6:30.
Not long before Monday turned on Tuesday, coach Brewings Jim Morea said, "The next three days these boys are waiting for a meatbag."
The fact that the National student Sports Association had cancelled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the workload of the players, actually extended their working days – at least until Friday exams.
So the start of the first three training sessions at the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already heavy game schedule.
The side effects of the lack of two exercises per day have increased in the number of days with one exercise, and Bruyins is moving the start of the camp for almost a week compared to last year and is conducting training in summer school for the first time in the six seasons of Mora in Vesot.
They are scheduled to conduct 18 exercises until 20 August before starting formal preparations for the first game in the season against the team of Texas University, A&M, in September.
Maura said that he supported the change of rules by the National student Sports Association, even though it had created one more point in the games.
“During the three or four days, we give them this tremendous burden, this is a serious test,” Maura said.
“They just beat it up, they work, they're great guys.
I think that when we live to Saturday and we have more time, it'll be really great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will set the practice off; it's not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view of the adjacent parking lot and the nearby Laskin Center, the expensive hotel, which has already been bombed by football balls that have crossed the protective net behind gates.
Brewins players are expected to take a hotel from this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, a problem may arise.
"We will have protection," Maura said.
“This is a serious problem, and I'm not overstated by the danger of someone taking a room, sitting there and recording the practice on video.
If you have a video recording of training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and park guards number 8.
We'll do what we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the attack in Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All those injured during the terrorist attack on St. Petersburg metro were released from hospitals in April.
This was reported in the press service by Vice Governor Anne Mititene.
At the end of July, there were three people in the hospitals, transmitting the TV Center.
We remember the explosion at St. Petersburg Metropolitan on 3 April this year.
Bomb was blown up by a suicide bomber, Aqbarjong Jalilov.
The terrorist killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Remember, the previous day, Rosybudsor recommended that the Peterburg Metropolitan review the road map for transport security, inter alia, by increasing the scope of metal detectors.
Facebook is increasing its stocking to fight against fairy tales.
Facebook will more frequently send texts suspicious of myth, independent experts, and present their findings under original posts, declared on Thursday the world's largest social network, which is trying to combat the so-called fairy news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible misifications, send them for verification and possibly show the results of a fact-finding under the entry post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fairy news that many people believe has influenced the Presidential elections of 2016 in the United States.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters have been misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May and in Germany before the September elections expressed support for the plan to fine social networks if they do not quickly remove hate-incitement posts.
On Thursday, in a separate German statement, Facebook reported on a test of a new fact-thkin algorithm that had been launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“Just to see which reports are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context in order to make reasonable judgements about what they read and what they are sharing”, wrote the Facebook News Manager at Sara Sue in his unit.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the "linked articles" function and work on other changes in the news feed to address the issue of fairy news.
Create a comic book: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scottney's tiny castle was shot in the music video "Squeeze," and in the 1970s and 1980s, served as a shelter for Margaret Tetcher.
But for 700 years from his comfortable spot in the Beul Valley in Kent County, he was watching the stormy history around him, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, theorkshire, with the back hair and the propensity of history, the comic book.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he said with encouragement.
"You feel it in person when you keep this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers the period of the Middle Ages to the Evardian era and tells of families living in Scotty; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkiewicz, Brian May Smith, William Accley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book, which is based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote "The Dead Man and Other Historys" -- a collection of British Library documents; this project suddenly touched him to the depth of his soul.
"I could have been touched by a print of a finger on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for a yakubite," he says.
"It's his finger print."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because at that time the lights were lit.
300 years later, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, I love archives!"
For a person involved in this passion for old papers, to gain support from the National Foundation and the British Artist Council and to live in the castle for four months (“To be honest, I've got a little lunch there”), it seems that it's too good to be true.
The family studied Victorian castle all day, went through archives and looked at numerous treasures of name and old things - such as walls or bottles on the walls.
He went through the park and the collapse of the old castle, talked to the foresters, gardeners, and sometimes to the artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
Then, at night, he would "drink whiskey and sit down to write."
The history of Scotty's castle is not very well understood, because the National Fund was fully accessible only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hasi, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff were just starting to deal with an archive that he described as "that the aristocracy had been down on the attic for centuries."
The daydreamers, the letters of the time of the British Empire, maps saying, "You think land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but this is where two families fought.
It's true, guys!
In some stories, the castle's collection becomes a starting point for wider research in English history, for example, at the "Rotnik", a hero leaving the newly built castle to join the Cretan Revolution of 1381.
“There is information about the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called the Knight Families of Kent and Sassex,” says Rhodes.
"The peasant revolt started in these places, and I thought the rebellion was a good start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle, such as the Sanctuary, which tells of a Jesuit priest whom Darrellov's family had been hiding during the English Reformation for seven years.
Or Contrabandist, about the 18th-century smugglers Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral, hit the tomb with stones (that was discovered several years later when the tomb was dug).
The Darrells, the beloved Rodza family of all who lived in Scottney, said, "Jentlmen seem to have been committed by a camel, they've been in debt forever, and they've spent money on what they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women, and I imagine them as a company of pretty guys who can take care of the heirs of great states."
Since the end of the work at the Castle, Rhodes has been looking for other opportunities to acquire unique written experience.
He spent two weeks on a Finnish hustle, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elemyanyak, a place where the sanatorium was at the beginning of the twentieth century and then it grew again in the forest.
But Scottie has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to reality."
Fifteen largest banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, TB-24, Alpha-bank, Gasprombank, Rosshozbank, Binbank and the FK Open, seven more are going to leave the public organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be affected by withdrawals from ARB.
But it is not simply a way out - all banks that have announced a break with ARB are negotiating with another public organization that brings credit facilities together - the Russian Association of Regional Banks, which is headed by a prominent politician, Anatoly Axakov, the Chairman of the Committee of the Committee of the Committee of the Committee on the Financial Market, which has been recognized as a result of the last session and the most effective head of the thinking committee and a deputies in terms of the number of bills that have been prepared.
The beginning of the conflict within ARB was the subject of a discussion in the Council of the Federation when new bills were considered by the Interregional Banking Council, in particular proposing a new classification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunyan, President of ARB, stated that, according to the association, the bill was adopted for the benefit of the largest banks, which were thus attempting to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions to intercept their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, in Tosunian's opinion, does not always rightly grant licenses to certain banks, which is true, was objected to by the representative of the CB: many of the heads of the banks, such as the Exprombank, were included in the ARB's governing bodies.
It seems that this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and is a visible reason that fifteen major banks, while not in agreement with ARB policy, are beginning to prepare for the association “Russia”, noting that “the performance of ARBs is at a low level and constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually taking place”.
I think the contributors are better off.
What's the end?
The primary question that arises in or near a bank failure or conflict is that the depositors are not at risk; rather, the reliability of the banking system will be enhanced.
Head of the “Rassie” Anatoly Axakov, known for his or her care in all matters relating to the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in Central Bank: almost all the CB leadership is present at the annual activities of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are based on the peer review of the “regionals”.
It was also clear that there would be no special shocks, on the staff-organizational side.
There is no question that ARB is in the difficult financial and administrative situation after such powerful and influential participants are deprived of their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, in that oldest, established in 1991, a banking community organization, there was a considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of monetary treatment in general.
It cannot be said that in Russia, with open arms, it is ready to accept new members on any terms, according to its leader's response, Anatolia Axakov (“may wish too much”), who, at a briefing on 21 July at the Parliamentary newspaper's press centre, stated that “at the next day, banks leaving ARB asked me to consider the possibility of building the capacity of our Rasi Association”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Council of Association and to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
A negotiating process is under way, the proposals of both parties are being examined, and an extra-convention agenda is being prepared to be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll be.
Also, Anatoly Axakov, stressing that “the chair does not stick”, called the possible new leader of George Luntska's updated association, who leaves the post of Vice-President of Central Bank in September, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Axakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to suspend vacations for one day and to arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Russian Association Council, which is scheduled to consider the issue of the extra-curricular “Rassi” Congress.
There will be no restrictions on the entry of gasoline vehicles into Russia ' s major cities.
The Deputy Head of Mint, Nicholas Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline cars into Russia’s major cities will not yet be restricted.
It is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we must gradually raise the environmental class.
And there's a concept that goes right into zero emissions.
I think we're technically not ready for this.
The question is, since what year?
It's the same thing at the slogan level -- let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
"In 20 years, I don't know if that'll happen," brings the words of the Minister.
An earlier newspaper, Izvetia, reported that by 17 August, the Vice-Prime of Arcordania Birkovic had been entrusted with examining the proposals for possible options for electric transport lords submitted to the Government by the G.P.A.O. G.A.O. G.S.O.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of vehicles from FAA in major cities and in resorts.
Washington's changing the rules for receiving a credit card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the rules for receiving a cartel.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are being proposed by the Republican Party and are supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will be for a change in the way the United States gives credit cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will benefit the candidates who own English, have the financial resources that enable them to maintain themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy,” said Trump, according to the United States media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and that should bother us.
We have not succeeded in thinking that 2017 could no longer get any worse, having produced a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots.
Mm-hmm.
Sex robots are the focus of the moment.
The Responsible Robots Foundation (FRR) recently produced a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
In the opinion of Noella Charki, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffild and co-founder of FRR, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robot’s eye, the shape of the juice, and the type of fingertip.
"People are sneering about this, but firms are already sending them to their consumers, and we'll soon see them a lot more," said Charlie at her presentation of the new report.
Modern sex-ducks evolved from their inflated collections of robots with silcon skins warm to the touch, and with almost human messages controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users may also “stipate” their robots by taste, selecting all the colors of the eye and the shape of the succulent work to the shape and colour of the fingernails.
But the fact that many robots have a "person" over which Stepford's wife would be very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex glasses have become robots with silconal skin.
For example, RealBotxrobot allows users to develop the quality jobs they find attractive -- for example, shyness.
There are also works of the Roxxixy Gold, developed by True Company, which are presented with already programmed identity -- the Cold Farra, for example, gives an impression of shyness, and the Young Vandy has a "feeling" character.
"The Roxxixy Gold has a very good character for yours," "True Company" is fascinating.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't like, and so on.
She's having a change of mood during the day, like a real man!
She might want to sleep or talk or she might "be in the mood"!
In the emergence of sex robots, much is a matter of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most disturbing thing is the subordinate image of a woman, the associations with rape that cause the cold—read the Farah to possess.
On the "True Company" site, Roxxxy is compared to a vibration only for men.
"If a woman can have a vibe, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" says on the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex with subordination as an option addition.
Most men would, of course, not buy sex robots, and while FRR noted their growing popularity, they were still on the field of consumer culture.
But what is being done to us from the field can be very instructive about the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid and aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complex sex robots came about when women's rights around the world were threatened when there's a president in the White House who boasts about what's happening to women.
The most frightening of the TV series is the performance of the maids -- not graphic images, rolled bodies and twisted eyes -- that is, how realistic that vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem that big right now.
The goal of the sex robots industry is to make a physical representation of women as real as women (with pornography only) as the technology allows.
Their creators want them to turn themselves into humans for the purpose of digging the movement of the human body.
But it's the robots that are not like real women with their "haracters."
They cannot break up or withdraw from their partners.
They don't have their life or their biography, anything that points to independence, or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful rabbis.
Or, as they say in 2017, the servants.
Los Angeles Eugene (Puh) Jeter, who has been in favour of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national basketball team of Europe, the final part of which will start on 31 August.
Andrey Lebedev, the general manager of the blue-yellows, was informed of this in an interview at the BeBasket portal.
We tried to reach out to Jeter, but unfortunately he's not going to be in family circumstances.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will give us the opportunity to develop our young players," he said.
I recall that, with Jeter's direct involvement, Ukraine's team took its sixth record place on the Eurobasket-20 and was first hit the basketball champion of the world, where the yellow blues failed to overcome the group phase, and the U.S. adult won an average of 15.4 points, made three selections, and gave five broadcasts.
Jeter stopped speaking in favour of Ukraine since the main trainer of our national team, an American man, Mike Fratello, resigned in 2015.
The male Eurobasket-2017 will take place simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will host a group tournament on Earth promised.
Supportive Evgeny Murzin would have five connections in group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our male team held two tests, in which Dutch and Belarusians were assigned.
A great feat of Trump?
Showing Mitt Romney seems pretty reasonable.
In the Trump era, it was common to see some families being hit by political disputes that polarized the American electorate.
Between Christmas and Christmas, U.S. newspapers told stories about how to deal with the horrible relatives who voted for Trump.
I think we're all strained so soon we'll pop.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about this because my cousin, the left views of a Chicago poet who had been under knives with Republicans in her family for a long time, came to New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
At Trumpa, in the White House, all she knows, including the publisher brother with whom she argued about politics for decades, were suddenly and strangely on one side.
That's certainly good for dinner; but I can't help but think that, in the broader context, it can be quite dangerous.
The Trump breathed into the left flank, but the distorting effect of its rule can push us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "reform," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will be cut off from his journeys.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which the Trump "reforms" the most right-wing republicans, who, on the basis of its standards, suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I found myself missing so much today from Mitt Romney's old-fashioned insanity -- with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax declaration looks like) -- compared to Trump and both, it seems like a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just have to be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the Central Park, the largest car in the New York Park Department and the best way to spend three dollars in the city, if you don't want the caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, glassboard images on the central drum -- scaly clowns and animals, who glisteningly look at their backs, are extremely vicious, and a strange music gravitating.
So many well - known things in this city are frustrating: the species from the skyscrapers grow old, the silhouettes of the buildings were too attached to make them tremble, and the reality of the city was not dreamt of their dreams.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day when I learned that the area of the Suisse Scottage is not really a Swiss shuttle (the thematic pob of "You Old Swiss Godage" is not in account) but a big round overlap in North London.
And the Carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, a 11-year-old child, and two women in 40s can have a great time.
If I could make an assessment, I would have put a five-year-old, but fortunately, no one asked me to do that.
And in the department store this week, I was asked before making a card on the terminal to evaluate my "test" on a scale ranging from one to five stars.
In a caffeine store at the corner of my street, the same thing plus a 15-per-cent tip is for the order of the desk.
As a result, neutral interaction is slowed down, but it is also necessary to make a personal contribution to a situation that does not involve it.
The poor dealer in the department smiled in an unsatisfied manner while I was tired of evaluating my experience with the delivery of a credit card to her in five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital for chest pain
Pitorius is leaving prison because of his visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which the prison administration said he had received as a result of his fall into a cell.
Pytorius was convicted of intentional murder following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office for an initial sentence for unintentional murder.
He killed Sténkamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shot several times through the toilet door in his house in Pretoria.
Pitorius claimed that he had taken his friend for a night’s thief hidden in his toilet.
The Public Prosecutor's Office announced its intention to submit another protest, this time against Pretoria's six-year term, which she said was too soft.
The Attorney General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that an appeal would be heard this year.
Pretoria's life could extend by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor's Office succeeded.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
A non-execution sign was selected for beating a journalist
Capital law enforcement officers chose a preventive measure in the form of a non-departure signature for a man who attacked a NNV journalist, Nikit Razzaev, during a live broadcast from Gorkoj Park on 2 August.
TTSS refers to the official representative of the IDP, Irinu Volk.
“In the context of the criminal investigation initiated under article 116 of the Criminal Code, a man of 32 years of age struck on the face of a correspondent of a television channel in the Central Park for the Culture and Rest of Gorkoj, a suspect has been elected a preventive measure in the form of non-departure and proper behaviour,” explained Volk.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for police misconduct had been drawn up against the suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, an extraordinary man approached the correspondent and hit the face during a live aircast to WBV Day.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the VFV.
On the contrary, they tried to arrest the Muscovites, according to Rizzójeva.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tenting
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the TV channel B-Te-V reported that two Bulgarian citizens had been detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people in Sitonia were detained, putting tents in an unsuspected location, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the television channel B-Te-V that the citizens of Bulgaria had then been released.
The Greek authorities have increased controls over the free camping and have already imposed serious fines on all who were caught while parked in a non-circuit area.
The checks will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, a court may impose a fine.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia accused U.S. Vice President of the cold war rhetoric
The statements made during the European tour by Vice President Michael Pens of the United States were criticized by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly streaming down to primitive ideological images of the cold war, which are totally isolated from reality”, states the statement of the Russian foreign policy department.
Thus, in the Middle East, the words of Pens about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly cross the borders he has announced in the Podgorica have responded.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out the destructiveness of the choice “or with the West, or with Russia” and the implausibility of the argument that the whole of South-Eastern Europe had entered NATO had been declared unalternative.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that had violated international law by using force to prevent Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“We call on the United States colleagues to cease Russia's leniency and foreign policy line, which has always been based on respect for partners and a willingness to work together in a constructive manner, on mutual consideration of interests”, states the statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Feldscher was injured in a "sharpen" accident in Podmoskovie.
The accident occurred in the pumping Stupino, as a result of an innocarca collision with the "Strategist" card, a Feldscher was hit.
Today, about 08:10cocks were hit by a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance carriage in the town of Stupino Moscow province.
“As a result of the collision, the ambulance turned over,” said the TTSS to the MLG press service in the Moscow region.
At the scene of the accident, there were law enforcement officers, and the circumstances of the incident were being clarified.
In Odessa district, a woman threw her newborn son on the construction site, turning her into a brick bag.
On the evening of 3 August, a local householder was informed to the Sectionnian Police Department that he had found a bag with a baby in a house that was not well built.
“The law enforcement officers and doctors who promptly took the child to a medical facility have gone to the scene”, reported to the National Police Head of Odessa.
Medical researchers determined that the boy was born a few hours before he was detected, as indicated by the umbilical condition.
Priority operational and investigation activities have identified the birthright as a 36-year-old local resident.
It has also been established that women have three other minor children.
As noted in the chapter, the family has not previously been included in the law enforcement field.
Police officers are now determining the circumstances and the reasons for forcing a woman to act, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under medical supervision.
As previously reported, in Nicolauve, a 21-year-old woman threw her unborn child in a garbage dump.
Gregory Leeps, "I'm going to fight, although 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful artists of the Russian epic, Gregory Leps, will celebrate his 55th birthday on an early Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke to the pollinator of the Isolation.
I remember what your "whoreman" said.
The special tent in the "Lucinaks", Gloria Ghenior's ashes for the noun, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have been pretending to spend your next five-year-old.
Is that right?
In terms of a profession, it was a good time.
I've been working a lot, I've been driving around with the country three times, and I've been giving 120 to 130 concerts a year.
I released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what I'm going to say 20 years ago.
Biological clocks don't lie.
Drinking like I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
I don't want to stop, though.
And I'm with new people, and I think I'm at a different level.
You write a new album with them, first in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it now.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we're gonna send it to the L.A. team.
It's called "What's so serious?" on a single song, written together with Timati.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't been teaching her anywhere.
We'll do it later when we film the video on her.
We'll present the album in November to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's "Crocus City Hall."
A nice American drummer, Chris Coleman, had a hand on your new plate.
Do you think you've wanted to get him into your own town?
I think Coulman is one of the world's most outstanding drummers today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I offered to join my group, and Jeremy Kolson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects).
But for long-term work in Russia, they have imposed disproportionate conditions, mildly speaking.
It was about fees between €35,000 and €45,000 a month.
So I thought in the post-Soviet space I'd find worthy musicians.
And I found Max Malishewa's great drummer.
It is best to feed one's own.
At times, I want to get on with some of them, not some of them.
For example, the guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly cited at the international level.
Western music magazines are written about him, and he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists, with another performing technique, has arrived."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are cooperating with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Are you trying to get rid of this ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I am truly sorry I can't get to America.
I've told you many times I've been there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We're not stupider than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have been completely without any of the tasks American musicians have always faced.
They sought as much quality as possible.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has denied me entry for ten years.
But I'm going to submit visa documents to the British Embassy every year to be allowed to return and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe belongs to me in a kind way.
And in August, you're going to have a concert in Monaco, not a registered concert, but a private concert, right?
Yeah, there's a good "Sporting" room in Monte Carlo, I've been there once.
Now they have been invited again, and as far as I know, all the concert tickets are already dissolved.
"Randwa Lyme Wykule" which will start on July 20 in Jurmale, will you go?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyme is a great singer and a wonderful woman who can serve herself with a beautiful eye, even a whisper.
After the garages and the anniversary concerts, I know you want to go to the crafts of Vladimir Wissowsky.
You already have two albums with his songs on your disco.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it'll be totally different.
I want to write about 80-90 Wissek's song down about the same as he did.
Just the voice and the guitar.
No other fences.
I'll be joined by our famous musician, Timur Wedernics.
I'll try to get involved in the album and Alexander Yakovlevic Rosenbaum.
I've talked to him about this subject, we've got a good relationship, but he's busy, so let's see what happens.
You and Boris Grebenzev's songs are slowly entering your repertoire.
Maybe you'll write an album of his stuff.
Boris Borisowicz is a wonderful man and a wonderful musician.
I had several times when I asked him if I could sing a song or something?
He said, "Grigoria, I write songs so they can be done."
Please try, sing.
I think it's interesting to write a album like that.
Until I have that kind of task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisowicz doesn't object, I might do this.
If you don't focus on your producers' business.
I don't suppose you've ever realized his potential by signing contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're independent, well-deserved people.
Do you mean Sergey Lazarusev?
Serge is a brilliant singer, I invited him in.
I can't agree to anything with his repertoire, but he's professional and he's got his development strategy.
And now, in my center, there's Alexander Paniotov, who I was driving to Golsa.
We have a contract with him and work.
In our pop music, these singers are rare.
It will be a sincere regret if he fails to attain the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, and I'm shooting the clicks.
I hope so.
I also try to move on to other artists in my centre, buying them songs, crying to poets, and sometimes their tracks get into the rotation of the television and radio channels.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They're going to get a recorded album on the way out, a few clicks.
And then, if they want to, they can go their way, and I'm not going to insist that they return the money invested in it.
While it would be a pleasure for me if any of them made commercial progress and paid me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I don't want to cover oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, try, prove how I once proved it.
If tomorrow you're asked to take a town tour in Ukraine and guarantee entry, will you go?
They still invite me in there.
In the main, these are closed activities.
And the big class...
I was a Russian-born man flying to Syria on the same plane as I did later.
If tomorrow says you have to go somewhere else in the interest of the state, I'll be mad.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that this has happened to Ukraine.
Because I think we're one people and we have to be together.
I'm sorry that this isn't going to work, at least in the near future.
I used to be in Ukraine for 40 to 50 concerts a year.
They've met like nowhere.
Thank you very much.
And with a few Ukrainian artists, they cooperated: Ania Loreak, Light Lobodoy, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, the masses of gifted people are very sorry that they are currently unable to fully reach out to the wider Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would be happy to invite a classed Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slav Vácarchuk, and to make a joint concert with him.
But I think it's not likely at this moment...
Andriya Oglopka was thrown from the cosmodrome
As noted by the report, the technical director of the East Andrey Olopkov Cosmodrome began his work at the Khrushiev State Space Research and Production Centre.
In the past, he had engaged in the construction of the East Cosmodromo, but because of disagreement with the management of the Centre for the Exploitation of Land and Space Infrastructure (CENCI), he had been transferred to Moscow Field, where the coordination of production would take place.
Mr. Oclopkov will not have a replacement: the post of Technical Director is likely to be abolished and the function is scattered across the CENCI units.
That the technical director of the Eastern and Deputy Director of Technology, Andrey Olopkov, went to work at the KNPC Khrunichev, the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as a staff member of the Government.
"He's been working for a new post for weeks," clarified the business interlocutors.
The CENTI operational commentary was not available on Thursday, and Mr. Oclopak himself was not available for comments.
However, the “get” information was officially confirmed at the GNSC.
He decided to take over the post of Director of Production Coordination, and announced to the enterprise.
Mr. Oclopkov went to work at CENCI in 2013, serving behind the shoulders of the space force, in particular on Baiconur, and in Pletzka on the cosmodrome as the first deputy commander of the Colonel's rank.
In 2009, Andrey Oclopkov became a figure in the criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: it was alleged that since his introduction, regional businessmen had been received for the pumps of the State, but had failed to meet the commitments made to clean up the separated parts of the carrier missiles in the Archangelic region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury court found him innocent.
The ENERGY responsibilities for technological development were extended to different projects, but the main ones were the construction of a launch site in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview, said explicitly that the situation in East “was critical as early as October 2013”.
The case was that a strategic error was made in the planning process: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Union-2.1 carrier rocket was planned for the same time, at the end of 2015.
In order to complete the run by the end of the year, the construction was completed six months earlier and the time frame was moved from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, the TRENI specialists have begun to maintain parallel installation of technology equipment in undeveloped facilities.
Andrey Olopuk was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks that existed and the transfer that took place (instead of December 2015, the Union left only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source “toy” on the cosmodrome: “If we would still not carry out a single bullet from the East but would be building”.
Vice-Prime Demetrius Rogozin, in charge of creating the cosmodrom, used to describe Andrea Olopukova as his “space Susan”, but he almost always requested information on the progress of the construction.
Mr. Ohlopkov was remembered and direct: for example, in an interview, he suggested that the Federal Special Construction Agency (Spanisher) be removed from the status of the only East Executive and work directly with the sub-contracters: "Why should we all put eggs in one basket of Specialstro?"
This idea has found support in the Government.
Since 2017, CECI has assumed the responsibility of the contractor general to complete the start-up and technical construction work by the fourth quarter of the launch.
According to Mr. Oclopkov, the reason for the transition to a new place of work was the disagreement with the TRENC leadership on how to complete the construction of the structures and the space probes, as well as the working methods with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be best for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the East Administration.
A government staff member, in turn, calls the decision odd: “He was one of the best specialists to find the equivalent of a replacement.”
As indicated by the Board, this will not be necessary: the post of Technical Director of the Cosmodrom will be abolished and its functions will be dispersed from the CECI units.
There will be a two-skills programme in music schools
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two skills at the same time.
According to the Ministry of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture of St. Goulbenko, students can be re-readed with repeated disciplines, and the question of the payment of the rest of the second course is to be resolved through special grants, which is to be passed to the RIA News.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we will work with the expert community to develop a mechanism that will allow two occupations, but will not conflict with existing educational legislation”, said Goulbenko.
Last Friday, at "No Child Talk" Vladimir Putin with her students at the Cirius Children's Center, a student, Maria Andreeva, reported that she had to pay for repeated subjects in second occupation at the CMM at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was studying in the class of violins and piano and was awarded competitions in both directions.
The head of State acknowledged her question to be very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man was detained on a skyscraper wall
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian, Cyril N., who had climbed to the roof of a towering building, reported the portal El Universal.
An incident occurred in the capital city of Mexico City.
The youth, with the help of two unknown men, moved through a three-metre fence into the Nestle office building complex and took one of his towers on his own.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or rope.
The young man was already being held on the roof.
The officers of the Ministry of Public Security put him on the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
It explains whether the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, the video with a young man who got up in the highlands became popular in the Network.
Users called the boy "man spider."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to facilitate KPC.
Red meat and chocolate are supposed to be a nightmare for your digestive tract.
Recent studies have suggested the opposite: diet rich in meat proteins and milk products can help to alleviate symptoms in those who suffer from inflammable intestine diseases.
It is an incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leading to blights and inflammation, chronic or bloody wear, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While meat and milk are commonly recommended to reduce symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid protein of triptofan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, chairman of the study, explained that immune cells in the intestines do not allow harmful bacteria from the food to enter the body.
Cells capable of starting an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance is too severe for inflammation, it may lead to inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The experiments showed that mice with a certain bacteria in their intestines appear to be more tolerant cells.
And this bacteria needs a triptofan, one of the protein's building elements, to start these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We've established a connection between one type of bacteria -- Lacobaccillus reuteri -- which is part of the normal intestine microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptofan the more a mouse diet, the more these immune cells are."
He suggested that the same thing would work for people: a combination of L. reuteri and a rich triptofan of a diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inclined atmosphere in the intestine.
Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barragawas, who studied the diversity of increasing tolerance in immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells and another group, which belonged to the same line but was kept separately, had no them.
She assumed that the difference could be caused by mice microbioms - bacterial communities, viruses and fungus that usually live in a stomach tract.
The DNA of the intestine cells of the mice were separated, and six kinds of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells, but missing in the mice without them.
Mics grown in the stereo environment, without good microbiom and without immune cell development, received L. reuteri, and immune cells came into existence.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew L. recuteri in liquids and then transferred small amounts of liquid, without bacteria, to unintelligible mouse cells.
Immunal cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it became a by-product of the processing of triptofane, known as the indolol-3-moleric acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptofane in mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the triptofan level was halved, the cell count also dropped by half.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same increasing tolerance of cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our stomach tract.
It is not known whether by-products of triptofane from L. reuteri have the same development as mice, but people with inflammatory intestinal diseases have found defects in the genes associated with triptofan.
She says, "Maybe we should strengthen the development of these cells because these cells are dependent on inflammatory processes on the inside surface of the gut.
High levels of triptofane with L. reuteri can potentially lead to a population expansion.”
According to José Mourinew, Manchester United hired “Genia” in the face of Nemanja Matic
Manchester United hired “Gebia” in the face of Nemananya Matić, thinks José Mourinu, after a semi-protector debuted a match against “Sampdoria” on Wednesday evening.
A player acquired 40 million pounds from Chelsea began with a 2-1 in Dublin at the last U.N. game of Super Bowl against Real Madrid on Thursday, and made an impression as a paratrooper, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke out first when they were envied.
However, as Matić did not attend the Chelsea Pre-Side Round in Asia, he was seriously short of preparation for the game, and he had only 45 minutes to endure, which, according to Maurenia, needed to be finalized before the start of the Prime League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, mind, genius, when he thinks he's thinking about football," said Muurina.
"We'll help him get ready sooner than late."
Like Matic, his comrades, Victor Lindellof and Romel Luka, started a game on the stadium of Aviv when Mourin began to form his main composition by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourin wanted to hire three more players, but it was suggested that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players it wanted to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for having obtained three out of four”, he added.
“I'll be even more happy if they get me four of the four, but they've done a great job for me already.”
Former leaders of the social democracies of Lithuania pressure them to remain in the ruling coalition
The former Presidents of the Lithuanian Socialist Democratic Party, the ex-Primencies Algirdas Butyavicus and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Seimas Social Democratic Party, Cheslovas Jurchenas, appealed to the same party to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the Parlatment newspaper, as a result of discussions with partners, the peasants and greens, the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion about whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
There were three senior experienced comrades with an open letter, which states, inter alia, that “It is clear the frustration of the party comrades with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the peasants has created for us a way that is not very easy, but it is still easy to pursue the goals of social justice that are envisaged by our initiative in the Government programme and to maintain the political domination of the left-wing centre over the right-wing parties”.
In the view of former party leaders, for the time being, “there has been an emotion-based expression of opinion without specific arguments”.
The authors fear that the thoughtless actions of their party may lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
A disabled man named Anton Mamav has been fined
Mosgordis reduced the penalty for disabled persons, Anton Mamaev, from four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
Earlier, a convicted person had been released from ICSO by a decision of the Tymirsaw Court.
Mosgordov, however, confirmed that the accused was a criminal, since he had organized the robbery and abduction of a motorist from a former special forces man.
Mossgordis, by his decision, reduced the punishment of Anton Mamav to 200,000 roubles.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be criminally prosecuted”, explained the “getting” of the press secretary, Uljan Solopov.
The court took into account Mamaeva ' s state of health, the factual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which punishment may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Ms. Vasili Serostová's assistant, the court did not establish circumstances that would give rise to a change in the category of gravity of the crime and to a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself claimed that he was dissatisfied with the decision of Mosgarso.
I'm disappointed with the court decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, will continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not rule out appeals against the sentence before the Court of Cassation of Mosgorso and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all the instruments up to the European Court of Human Rights”, he stated, “A RA Novosta”.
Remember, 28-year-old Musczych Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a criminal figure in the fall of last year.
The disabled claims to have bought a motorseller from people familiar with 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, the owner of a motorized gun, including a former special forces fighter, claimed that persons with disabilities and his assistant Vasili Serostov had taken their property to the point of threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Moscow District Court sentenced Vasili Serostova to three years of colony, and Anton Mamaeva to four and a half years ' imprisonment while serving a sentence in a general regime colony (pursuant to article 162 of the Criminal Code).
After the disabled person had been placed in SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Human Rights Commissioner of President Tatian Moskalkov, had joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from SISM by a decision of the same Timimasev Court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorso.
ONF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The outcome of the Action Forum of the General People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, inform the Izves of the source in the IDF and confirm the Chief Executive Officer of Alexei Anysim' movement.
He said that at the end of the Forum, the pro-frontonics planned to prepare a report to the President on problems with the national environment, as well as to propose a strategy to address them.
The Ethodi interlocutors in the FNL note that the report of the Head of State will contain “deep analysts” on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
The Ethodi data indicate that the EPF outcome forum will be held in autumn.
The exact date for its holding has not yet been determined - it is generally aligned with the President ' s timetable, which is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key UNPF events.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts, in Rostov-na-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan Ude.
On the basis of the suggestions made and will be made at these events, we will formulate systemic proposals to address environmental problems, and spoke to the EDF interlocutor.
The Co-Chair of the Central Headquarters of the Mouvement of Olga Timofev, Chairman of the Committee of the State on Environmental Protection and Environment, reported that "Fronts" would report to the Head of State on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Environment in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the ONF Forum are likely to be combined.
During the year we grew up with a powerful team of experts on environmental issues, saw gaps in legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "Frequentials" are also given an account of the work on the priority projects of the ONF, as told by Olga Timofiev, the “Researchers”.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues would be invited to the Forum.
He had previously participated in the UNF Mediaforum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of the Environment will go back in history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to set up environmental mechanisms to work for years.
So that they do not fall out of their agenda, Ollah Timofeev added.
Andrey Kolyadin, head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), noted: by raising environmental issues, the ONF acts in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they have proposed as experts in various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the President, said Andrey Kolyadin to the Experts.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded to date, which could give the regions additional impetus to development.
In the future, with the help of ONF, regions will be able to address not only their environmental problems but also ecotourism, adding an expert.
The relevance of environmental issues has demonstrated the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the debris dump in Balashich (even closed) and coal dust in the port of Najduk (hereinafter drafted a bill banning the open transfer of coal in human settlements, one of the authors, Olga Timofeev).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for dealing with environmental problems has been established in Russia as a whole and that the question lies in further enforcement practices, as well as in the position of civil society.
Leonid Bochin, head of the Ecology for All charity fund, needs to be clearly implemented by the State.
HRC Member, the head of the Russian non-governmental organization Greenpeace, Sergey Tipplenkov, in talking to the Izves, stressed that a responsible approach of society and business and legislative efforts is needed to address environmental problems successfully.
As soon as society and business realize that addressing environmental problems is a much more beneficial step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, as Sergey Tsplenkov noted.
The expert stressed the need to reverse the tendency that violations of environmental law were economically beneficial for business.
British inventor used a microchip to get into a house and car by arm's blow.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open his house's door, go into the office, and even run a car with a simple armpit.
Stephen North, a 30-year-old, used a tiny chip between a large and indexing finger and now, through his bioTeck firm, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives on the basis of technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from Royal Winchester, to ensure that the application procedure is conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is similar to the microchip used by cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northham company also replaces locks in homes and cars that are compatible with a 300-dollar chip price for one lock.
A child's married father has already installed technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The White House report was worth thousands of dollars to taxpayers.
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the magazine TIME, the decision of the White House last month to oppress the marine infantry helicopter in the South Lawn on an event dedicated to American industrial production cost the taxpayers a total of $24,000.
The White-Green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, was a central element of the 17 July White House event that showed American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pens and senior white house officials examined technology products from all fifty states.
The helicopter, which took place in Connecticut, was fired next to a boat from the state of Man, a fireship from Wisconsin, and a trainer from the Mission.
According to the records of the first marine infantry helicopter (HMX-1), the helicopter management department ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order or “FRAG” just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn in the case of an “unustrative” event.
“I just wanted you to be sure that you were aware of this because it's an unusually widely publicized press event”, wrote the Commander of HMX-1 in an electronic letter to his superior, the first Deputy Air Commander of the Marine Corps, on the e-mail before the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive in South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend the 3-hour event before the lawn would be released on the same day between 6 and 9 p.m.
The letter adds that, if departure from the White House is delayed, the second crew will be required to travel back in accordance with hours constraints.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the operation, while the unit security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records received by TIME whether the second crew was required.
The Hetcha Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 has clarified whether the event is inconsistent with the regulation.
“We asked, among other things, if it was a violation of Hatcha's law, and we were told it wasn't”, the commander wrote.
“You look like you don't have to go anywhere,” the Deputy Chief replied.
The event “Acade in America” was declared an official event by the White House and was not covered by Hetch's law.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the health reform that was then being developed in the Senate and commended the attempts to regulate government regulations.
Use of aircraft known as the Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is unlikely to be new.
Presidents are required to use them for their journey.
But it's not unusual to ask for them alone in the interests of photoability.
Trump had already been the subject of a discussion in February, when the presidential plane had passed to the rear at his first election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was overwhelmed by reports of the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is enchanted by the showing of ‘Docile in America’, which presented products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” said Deputy Press Secretary of the White House Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights around Washington Agglomerations and on the South Lawn to train the transport of the President of the United States to the White House with accuracy to an inch.
When Trump was at G-20 in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight performed for “America” was recorded to the crew on the basis of the required training flights per month.
The units also took 11 additional hours on that day as part of “non-president support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers had no expenses for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorski reported that the company had not been involved in organizing a demonstration of the helicopter in South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not report on the presidential flight budget and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Ministry of Defence time rate of 2017 fiscal year, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes each way from its airfield at the Quantico Marine Air Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than this rate.
“The value of the taxpayers is completely incorrect, ” says Walters, on the basis of an estimated rate of reimbursement.
“These indicative rates include personal composition, services and many other irreversible costs, which are included in annual assimilations.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by the REND corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the value of fuel, services and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, the former White House Spyser press secretary spoke out in favour of the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to demonstrate this week the things that have been done in America," said Spyser.
“And I know that Sikorski and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked so hard on.
It is, of course, entirely appropriate to draw attention to this.”
It was not clear whether Trump worked with the helicopter as he examined the South Lawn during the exercise, but he was clearly sitting in the driver's seat in a firefighting car.
At the inside of the White House, Trump made a statement to Sikorsky, a press joked on the subject of his own fleet of products.
"I know "Sikorsky," said the President. "I have three."
Moscow will provide grants for the intensive care units of the urban hospitals
Safe Life Grants will be allocated to intensive care units and intensive care units in the capital health centres each year.
Funds will be sent to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobian, visited the Judith City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he sent a generous letter to the doctor in the Travmatologist orthopedae, Victor Procco, which was led by a major reconstruction operation for the juvenile feet.
Sergey Sobian also referred to the decision to allocate grants to intensive care units and intensive care units each year.
Funds will be directed to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the capital grantician, the Judas Clinical Hospital is today one of the largest hospitals in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment to enable its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the Colorado Rural Hospital.
Currently, health-care units are designed to accommodate more than 1,000 patients.
In addition to intensive care, there are day-to-day offices.
The number of hospital staff is 2,800.
The total area is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the Medical Establishment became a participant in a pilot project on the organization of short-term residences (SCR).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
Surgeons use advanced medical equipment to significantly reduce rehabilitation time.
After the operation, they only spend a few hours in the hospital.
In the first half of the year, 36,000 patients were provided with permanent medical care at the Judith Clinical Hospital.
Medical staff at the clinic performed 15800 operations of various degrees of difficulty.
IA reported that there were no Ukrainian “daughters” of Sberbank
In Nazbank, Ukraine (NBA) there were no requests for purchase of Ukrainian “daughter” Sberbank.
This is on Friday, 4 August, with reference to the NBA press representative.
The IAS confirms that on 3 August 2017 a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokopene, to agree on an indirect (through Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 per cent of the Sberbank shares has been withdrawn.
“No documents were received from other potential investors to purchase the Sberbank shares in the U.S.A.”, notes the communication.
On 3 August, a Belarusian businessman, Victor Prokoccene, withdrew an application for purchase of the Sberbank subsidiary structure.
On 28 July, it became known that Natzbank of Ukraine had denied Russian businessmen Saidu Gucériev and Grigoria Guselnik to purchase the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
The regulator based its decision on the failure of businessmen to provide the necessary documentation for verification of compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank reported on the sale of its Ukrainian “daughters” consortium, Nrvik Banka, and a private Belarusian company, in March of this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, son of the Russian businessman Mikhail Gucreiev.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from raising their capital to the benefit of their parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, stated at the United Nations.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, are present on Wednesday, the head of the United Nations mission to Afghanistan.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial elections, three women fighting for Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Selections can only be fully representative when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
The provincial council and the presidential election will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threaten to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from military operations to advisers.
In this year ' s election, power is for the first time moving peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Hayse said that enhancing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
Of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women, according to the Afghanistan Independent Electoral Commission.

In Venice, fines were tightened for misconduct by tourists
The Venice authorities tightened the penalty for bathing between Euro50 and Euro500.
For walking around the city in a bathing room or with a treadmill, the fine of Euro200 will now be fined.
For 100 euros, those who make a pickup at a public place or ride a bicycle in the pedestrian areas will need to have the TSA transferred to Russia’s Association of Tourists.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities impose a fine on the 400 euro monuments and on the debris of 25 euros.
To inform tourists of the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice, the ad hoc company "Religion, Respectable Venice" (#EnjoyRespectVenesia) in social networks, as well as through advertisements and posters on the web site of the city council, in the belboards and in the most common tourist sites.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Paula Mar's Tourism Adviser, fines will be sent to the embassies of the country of the violators to warn them of such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she said.
In April, the Italian city administration announced plans to restrict the Turks.
Venice has already successfully restricted the number of tourists visiting the city centre.
Only 60,000 visitors were allowed to attend the Festa del Redentore festival instead of 100,000.
In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on the establishment of new hotels and fast-food restaurants in the historical part of Venice.

The FF has freed Lake from the position of head of the committee
The Council of the Federation endorsed the statement of the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Victor Lake, and dismissed him.
He remains the senator of the Khabarovsk province.
A request for his release from his post, Lake, wrote last week.
He explained his decision to the need for rotation and his desire to “change the rhythm of life”.
The senator also noted that the decision to leave had not been interpreted.
Víctor Lakerov has been submitting to the FMF the Khabarovski Legislative Assembly since 1996.
The Senator ' s Defence and Security Committee has been chairing since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers.
The long-standing efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buratiy (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for consumers of electricity are beginning to bear fruit.
From 1 September to 25 per cent, the cost of electricity in low voltage for industrial recipients is lower.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the decision of the Government of the Russian Federation “On amending the Regulations of the Whole Energy and Power Market and on the Consolidated Projected Balance of Production and Supply of Electrical Energy (Strategy) within the framework of the Single Energy System of the Russian Federation” (17.07.2017, No. 842) established indicative prices for electricity and power for the industrial consumers of the Republic of Buratia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for drilling producers is reduced by one quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades, the leaders of the republic have been breaking down the thresholds of the Moscow Cabinets in futile attempts to equate the region with the tariffs of the neighbouring Irkut region with those of the Angara hydropower stations coming from the Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buratia.
And it was only this year that the movement started.
In March, the electric energy tariffs for the population of the Republic are reduced from 4.24 rou/kWh to 3.93 rou/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the Federal Government ' s inclusion of Buritia in the list of wholesale price zones, which set out the characteristics of wholesale and retail markets for industrial consumers.
According to the analysts, this is only a beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/hour 1.01 rubles.
But no one dare call it a near date for the new tariff movement downwards for Buratia.

The National Trade Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Coy Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment at the McVitie's Factory in Glasgow
The trade union requires guarantees from the Bacter McVitie's managers for his long-term commitment to plant production in Glasgow.
The GMB, Scottish office, reports that the company was silent about future investment in a Tokros facility.
More than 500 people are working on a factory that produces products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea.
Pladis Company, the owner of McVitae's, reports that over the past few years, it has invested more than 5 million pounds in the site.
It adds that in the event of any changes in the work of the site, staff members and representatives of the trade union “know them first”.
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the GMB Scottish office demanded from McVitie's reaction to concerns that funding would not be launched for modernization of production lines.
The senior organizer, Drew Duffy, stated: “The core concern of our trade union is that we cannot obtain clarity from the head of the business needs facility and the investment plan on Tolcoss' future.
Families worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers was great in local society and the Greater Glasgow; it was a crucial pillar of decent work in the Territory of high unemployment and social degradation.
So, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brekzit, the growth of subsistence minimum and the chronic decline of production, East Goslago desperately needs the flourishing production of the McVitie's factory.
According to the representative, “The head of the Tokros facility only received a letter yesterday from the Scottish GMB office, and the company will respond immediately because we appreciate our continued cooperation with the employees and representatives of the trade union”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tokross with the officers and representatives of the GMB, at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We talked to the staff about how all the companies working in the most competitive and volatile economic climate are constantly reviewing their actions – and that is true of all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tokros facility, especially in the production lines and the improvement of the functional indicators.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcros as a production facility, and in the event of any change in the work at this site, the staff and representatives of the trade union will be aware of this first.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give orders to Rosnephty and Gazprom.
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas supplies to the East Petroleum Company (WNPC) should be joined by the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but that the Gazpromom, like the "Rosephti", would not be issued.
Thus Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin’s request to help resolve the contradictions that had arisen.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between “Rosephew” and “Gazprom” must be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Igor Sechin, the former head of the "Rosnephti" meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of Gazprom agreement on gas for HNPC endangers the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gasprom on this issue was continuing.
Gazprom suggests finding gas resources from the perimeter of "Rosnephty," but we don't have that, added Sechin.
Recall that the “Rosepht” requested that it be allowed to use gas from the Kyrenia field of Gasprom, located on the Sakhalin shelf.
In June, Gasprom stated that negotiations on the issue were continuing and there were no “strike angles”.
Did TPJ warn Barcelona of Neima's transition three years ago?
The member of the La League may regret his interest in Marco Verrati
The Paris Saint-Jerman will not stop pursuing Neimar after the club offered $189 million for his ransom, but have they warned Barcelona of the world's record of three years ago?
The countervailing proposal reactivated the summer transfer window when the League 1 Club was ready to beat the world record at the cost of the transition, more than twice as much as the previous mark of Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is over, Neimar will be the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's most highly paid professional athlete, since SWA offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week to be clean.
It is well known that Barcelona and the rage from the way the proposal was made and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the claim of the source close to the leadership of the Catalan Club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since its transition from Santos in 2013.
But has the football world not been warned of such a possibility three years ago by the President of the TSW?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in the employment of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khalifi warned strongly to any club that would like to lure one of the best players in the U.S.A.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll come against them, we'll make proposals to their players," Al-Khalaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences."
Barcelona appears to have crossed this line when a Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in Marco Verratti, a paramilitarist.
The WPW made it clear that it would not release the Italian player's assembled game under any circumstances, and it is likely that Barcelona now feels the consequences of its proposal in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neima.
Putin has been assigned to deal with the payments made by victims of forest fires.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia has been charged with handling the material assistance that is allocated to residents who are affected by forest fires and the construction of new housing.

“On this point, I would also like to ask the respective colleagues how much money has been allocated,” said Putin at a meeting with the regional leaders in the Baikal region.
On 4 August, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Biosphere Reserve.
Putina was accompanied by the Executive Representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District of Sergei Vinilo, and the Chief of the Bail of the Baikal branch of the Glagaribour Foundation, Leonid Mihaik.
They told us about work to clean up the lake.
Then they showed the boys in an open tank next to the container, which they had prepared for distribution.
First, Putin let go a couple of little ducks.
Then I pulled a special lever on the back of the container and let the others out.
Also during his visit, the leader had to deal with the environmental situation in Lake Baikal and build a road on the island of Olhoon.
According to Minström, one volume is needed and another volume is alleged to be required.
"I want to figure out what exactly we're funding going on there," said the Russian leader.
It will be recalled that in the forest fires of 2017, residents of Buritia, Irkutsk region, and houses and economic buildings were destroyed.
