The rapidly growing incidence of coroner infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The coronal morbidity of the coroner's infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union/Economic Area and in Britain, thus reaffirming that, despite different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Given the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, there is a need to increase the preparedness for treatment and, in particular, intensive treatment of patients with COVID-19.
On December 31, 2019, Hubey, China, reported a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown heretics.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the inflammatory disease was a new type of coronavor known as the 2nd type of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov-2).
From that point on, the disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 was called the coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to available data to date, about 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 are suffering from a mild disease, i.e., in the form of an infection in the respiratory pathway with or without pneumonia, with the majority of the people infected with pneumonia.
In about 14% of the cases of COVID-19, the disease is more severe with the need for hospitalization, and in the remaining 6%, it takes a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate for patients hospitalized from COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
This study analyses trends in cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) country and in Britain, and compares them with those in the Hubei Province of China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in Great Britain with data for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 disease in the EU/EEA and Great Britain
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is now developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamics as China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID 19 pandemic.
In Eurosurvellance of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the presence of the disease.
The three first confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were recorded in France on 24 January 2020, all three of which had returned from Hubey Province of China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections had been detected in all 30 EU/EEE countries and in Britain, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and 1,757, of which 1,750 deaths, including 1,441 fatal deaths, accounted for only Italy.
Definition of cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (EDC) updates, on a daily basis, at 8:00, the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources, such as health ministries of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the distribution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in Great Britain, and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an indicator of the rate of prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, the cumulative cumulative disease of COVID-19 was calculated in 14 days, taking into account the normal COVID-19 flow in each EU/EEA country and in Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also provided a cumulative number of cases in each country at 8:00 on 15 March 2020, compared with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in the development of COVID-19 in EU/EEP countries and in Britain
The trends in the development of the cumulative cumulative problem of COVID-19 during the 14-day period in the EU/EEA and in Britain generally corresponded to the trends observed in Kubey Province of China (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in Britain as a whole began to rise about 21 February and a sharp leap (additional material) occurred on 28 February 2020.
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEE countries and in Britain similar trends have been observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EE countries and in Great Britain compared with the figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded at 8:00 on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEE countries and in Great Britain is comparable to that recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in Britain.
The observed trends in cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This, despite different stages in different countries, different responses to national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases of disease and different rules for the selection of patients for COVID-19 analysis, including “verifying” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 required intensive therapy, while the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already as full as possible.
At present, only 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases (unpresented) are available for data on the admission of patients from COVID-19 to hospitals and/or intensive care units to the EU/EEE.
However, such data should be systematically collected to supplement current surveillance data, which are the subject of the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a 2010-2011 study, Europe has a large number of beds in intensive care and intensive care units, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC Risk Express Assessment Report on COVID-19 presents scenarios for modelling the loading of health system resources with estimates of hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in Britain, where the risk of lack of available beds in intensive care offices exceeds 90 per cent.
As cases are currently grouped for certain regions of the EU/EEA and Great Britain, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, information on infections and the number of beds in intensive therapy offices is recommended to provide territorial units for statistical purposes, if possible, at level 2 of Nomenclature (UTS-2).
Italy ' s experience and current trends in other countries show that the EU/EEA and the British CWID-19 pandemic are developing rapidly.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy units should be prepared for the SARS-Cov-2 contact scenario, which has been persistent, and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical attention and, in particular, intensive treatment, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the last ECDC Risk Express Assessment Report, the rapid, proactive and integrated approach to curbing the spread of SARS-COV-2 is important because, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to understand, take and adjust their responses accordingly, unless such measures are taken in advance.
The Risk Express Assessment Report also listed public health interventions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time in which they can step up their verification efforts to slow the spread of SARS-Cov-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks the health system will face in other EU/EEA countries the influx of patients who will need intensive treatment.
The outbreak of coronaviral infection 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronary of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has become a tragedy for humanity: at present, more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries around the world, and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the SARS-Cov homologic virus, which has developed a massive acute respiratory syndrome among thousands of people in 2003, SARS-Cov-2 may also be transmitted from bats and produces similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less of a disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and targets older people more than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on new diseases, this article offers a relevant and comprehensive overview of the rapidly developing subject matter of study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, theology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many of the answers are yet to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The spring holiday (Chinese New Year), which was struck in 2020 on 25 January, was an unprecedented and memorable event for all Chinese who were urged to remain home for and for many weeks after the outbreak of the new virus.
Given the high level of similarity with coronavirus (Cov), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the SARS-Cov-2 virus on 11 February 2020, and the related disease as a coronaviral infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Huhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then almost 50 other countries around the world.
As at 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been identified, more than 40,000 patients had been cured and more than 3,000 had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a “society number one” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, ethics, diagnosis and treatment, beginning with the first report of 7 January 2020, which defined the order of the virus from a number of patients.
The review is an attempt to consolidate research results into a new and rapidly developing subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronary disease, the coronary of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss current evidence of prevention and forecasting of the current disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Some 15 per cent of the general respiratory diseases have been classified as pathogens, which are not deadly to human beings and are mainly responsible for approximately 15 per cent of general respiratory diseases.
However, in this century, we have met twice the highly inspired coroner of human beings, that is, the coronavor of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) and the coronary of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-Cov), which caused a outbreak of disease at first China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other States with the terrible severity of the current disease and mortality.
Consequently, the present COVID-19 is the third outbreak of a coronavirus infection in the history of mankind.
As shown in figure 1.1, the first report of the workings of the Pneumonics of unknown origin was submitted to the National Health Commission of the Republic of Hungary, on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, Huhan ' s first death case was recorded.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health-care workers was reported, suggesting the possible transmission of the virus from a human being.
On 23 January, a quarantine was introduced into Ouhana and the city ' s public transport operation was terminated.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronary infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Uhan, which was considered the starting point of the infection against an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the coronavirus outbreak is a global public health emergency.
By the time the report was being prepared, the disease had spread throughout China and had spread to about 50 other countries around the world (figure 2.2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and level of the risk of outbreaks are yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.wixin.q.com/s/UlBi-HX_RHPXa1qHA2bhdA) was presented on a multi-centre clinical study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19.
SARS-Cov-2 was targeted by all age groups, but people between the ages of 30 and 65 were mostly infected.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few under 20 and only 14 had not yet reached the age of 10.
The induction of SARS-Cov-2 among men is greater than (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed mainly in the Hubei province and in the surrounding regions.
On the average, 5 (2-9) days were taken from the moment the COVID-19 symptoms were detected.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
From the time of symptoms to the time of death, the average was 9.5 (4.5-13) days.
The base value for reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons, which coincided with large-scale transport on the eve of the New Year's celebration of China.
Mortality among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10 to 1.86 per cent), while the adjusted death rate for patients was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02 to 4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors in the case of COVID-19 infection were: gender (male), age (?60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaus are a sub-unit of large cloud viruses containing one thread of a meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alphas, betas, gammas and deltas, of which alpha- and beta-organizers are known to affect people.
In the event of damage by SARS and MERS, the glycoprotein of shelled schilling (S) is connected to receptors of type 2 angiotensin, fertilizing fermentary fermentation (ACE2), and dipeptyleptias-4 (DPP4), respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.
The citoplasm is released by the virus gene RNA; after the replication of the virus gene, the genome RNA, together with glycoproteins and nuclecocappside protein, produces emitting vesiculars, which then merge with the cell membrane released by the virus.
The first reports of the SARS-Cov-2 genome sequence appeared on 10 January 2020.
SARS-Cov-2 has been identified as a new type of beechorogyrus, the gene of which coincides with the 10 consecutive samples collected at the first outbreak of the disease in the Huangian seafood market.
Genetically, SARS-Cov-2 is closer to SARS-Cov than MERES-Cov.
The SARS-Cov-2 particles have been found in extreme human respiratory cuts with the help of a illuminating electronic microscopy.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-Cov-2, as well as for SARS-Cov.
However, SARS-Cov-2 works with the ACE2 enzyme less weak than SARS-Cov, which explains that SARS-Cov-2 causes patients with less severity than SARS-Cov.
CARS-Cov-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein coded orf3b and a secret protein encoded or f8.
Orf3b of the SARS-Cov-2 virus may play a role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the IFNC virus; however, orf8 contains no known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, the authors' team, headed by Zhou (Zhou), reported on the cryoelectron scan of the structure of the full-scale ACE2 enzyme with a permit of 2.9 ° for the B0AT amino acid transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed co-information, was collected as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could be linked to two S-proteins, which served as evidence for detection and infection of the coroner.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-Cov-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Master
It is known that both SARS-Cov and Meres-Cov were the flying mice from which the virus was transmitted to the human person through the cyvetium and camel respectively.
The phylonetic comparison of SARS-Cov-2 with other coronarys has been found to be the first owners of SARS-Cov-2 to be the volatile mice, since the new virus is 96% identical to the SARS coronaviruses, namely the coronavirus mice of SL-CovZX45 and SL-COVZX21.
However, it remains unknown which species became the intermediate host, which has enabled the virus to overcome the type barrier and infect the human, and the way of transmission is also yet to be explored.
Mr. Jazi (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the virologist of the virus from flying mice to the human being was a snake, during which the homologous recombination in the S protein occurred.
According to a study by Chinese scientists from Guangzhou, the pangolins, which feed on ants and which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate masters of SARS-Cov-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the coroner-Koravis-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1% divided between the two genomes is still very large, so the final results with specific evidence are not considered to have yet to be obtained (figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-Cov-2 remain largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov may survive 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and 40 to 50 per cent humidity.
SARS-Cov-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-Cov-2 is known to feel at ultraviolet and heated to 56 °C for 30 minutes; the activity of the virus can be effectively blocked by air, 75 per cent lead alcohol, chlorinated disinfectants, peroxide, chloroform and other fattening solvents but not chlorhexide.
The human population as a whole does not have immunity to SARS-Cov-2, so people are receptive to the new virus.
At present, no detailed Immuno-Reaction studies are available.
Thus, we can refer only to earlier studies of other coronarys, primarily SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov (Figure 4).
Normally, the host of the virus will first recognize the innate immune system by means of image-discipline receptors (RRRs), including C-tape receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
By means of various mechanisms, the virus is causing inflammation factors, the ripery of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagosis for viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-bel of SARS-Cov, it may be possible to avoid an immune response.
An adaptive immune response is soon included in the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
The T-sticks of the CD4+ encourage the generation of virus-specific antibodies in the B cells, and the T-cells of the CD8+ kill directly the cells infected by the virus.
helper T cells produce anti-inflammatory cytocinins that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can instil the functions of T-cells by causing their programmed death.
Moral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against the virus infection.
For example, antibodies separated from a recovering patient neutralized MEERS-Cov.
On the other hand, the hyperrelation of the immune system entails a large number of free radicals, which could cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, could lead to polyorganic insufficiency and even death.
The SARS-Cov-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster exposure, is more likely to target older persons with co-demnifications and pregnant women.
The risk of infection is higher for those exposed to large numbers of viruses or violations of the immune system.
According to a survey of the first 425 infections in Uhan, the estimated average incubation period is from 1 to 14 days, mainly from 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases revealed an average period of 3 days, with a difference ranging from 0 to 24 days.
More recently, the above study based on the demographic data of 8,866 cases revealed that the incubation period was 4.8 (2.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for the health authorities to adjust the time limits of the quarantine measures, taking into account the most accurate calculations for the period of incubation, thus preventing the spread of the virus to those infected with a disease that is not symptomous.
The general practice is a 14-day quarantine for persons who have contact with the virus or who are infected with the virus.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, headache, headache, throat pain, narcelain, chest pain, diarrhea, thorax and thorax.
Some patients, a week after the beginning of the disease, had an obsolescence and/or hypotheses.
In severe cases, the disease has progressed rapidly and patients have developed a severe respiratory disease, septical shock, metabolic aciosis, and koagopati.
Patients with high temperatures and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even if there is no pathology in the chest.
A demographic study carried out at the end of December 2019 revealed the following prevalence rates: 98 per cent high temperature, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent breathing, and 3 per cent diarrhea; 8 per cent of patients required lung artificial ventilation.
Similar results have been obtained through two recent studies of cases of domestic infection and transmission of the virus from inflammable infections.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-Cov, with the main symptoms of high temperatures (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and obsolescence (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial ventilation of the lungs, a figure much higher than that of patients with COVID-19 and corresponding to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.
MERS also had diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), plumbing (40–42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and throat pain (13–25%), and lung artificial ventilation is required between 14 and 20 per cent.
As at 14 February, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2 per cent, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world was 66,576.
Compared to this, the death rate from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of the confirmed cases of 8,096 cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study carried out in June 2012 showed a 37 per cent mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study determined that the base value for SARS-Cov-2 was 6.47 at 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, whereas R0 for SARS-Cov was only 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-Cov-2 with Meres-Cov and SASA-Cov with symptoms, mortality rates and R0 is shown in table 1.1.
The above figures show that SARS-Cov-2 is more likely to be distributed than MERES-Cov and SARS-Cov, but the mortality rate is lower than the latter.
Thus, it will be far more difficult to contain the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic than the MERES-Cov and SARS-Cov epidemic.
Classical exposure often occurs when infected within a single family or group of people gathered together for any reason or in combination on any transport, such as on a cruise liner.
Patients often went to Uhan or other affected regions, lived there, or contacted the infected or sick in the last two weeks prior to the outbreak of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be suffering from the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and those cured from the hospital may again become carriers of the virus, and this is an alarming signal to extend the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in their field blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 have been diagnosed with white blood cells < 4x109/L, including licocells < 1x109/L, as well as with increased asparaguine-monoporosis and virus.
Some patients have found elevated levels of fertilized liver fertilisers, muscle fermentants and mioglobin in the blood of some patients, while most patients have elevated levels of C-reactive protein and blood red blood cells.
The level of D-dimer for patients with a severe disease, the product of fibrin decay present in the blood has been increased and the number of lymphocytes has been steadily reduced.
Most patients with COVID-19 have been X-rayed by a breast study with pathology characterized by uneven eclipses on both sides or by eclipses in the type of “matric glass” in the lungs.
Survivors often develop as a result of asphyxiation, severe lung damage, and severe respiratory disease (ORS).
In the development of ODS, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant gas exchange violation.
The function of the type I and II pneumatic pneumatics reduces surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increase the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of X - ray research often coincide with the most serious cases.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed that the pneumatic cavities were broken, the formation of the gylinal membranes and inter-sacular lymph infections, while the multi-nuclear synthic cells in the lung patients who died of the disease were consistent with the pathology of the virus infection and ODS and similar to those found in the patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion in the diagnosis of COVID-19, the RNA SARS-Cov-2 was detected by means of a polymerized chain reaction with opposite transcrysia (re-critorial transcrysia PCR).
However, in view of the high rate of phony that could accelerate the epidemic, from 13 February 2020 a diagnosis was introduced in China on the basis of clinical events (not relying solely on the reverse transcrysia PCR).
The same was true of the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, for effective diagnosis it is critical and it is necessary to combine data from the history of disease, clinical events, laboratory tests and X-ray research.
On 14 February 2020, Mr. Feng Zhang, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang, described SHERLOCK, based on CRISPR, for the detection of SARS-Cov-2; this method allows the detection of synthetic fragments of RNA SARS-Cov-2 with a density ranging from 20 × 10-18 mol/l up to 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10–100 copies per microliter sample) by means of detective strips less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new method, if successfully tested for clinical products, can significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of the tests.
Due to the lack of experience in countering the previously unknown coronary, doctors may, for the most part, provide patients with COVID-19 with only supporting therapy, while at the same time trying to apply any therapeutic methods that were used or offered in the treatment of other coronarys, such as SAS-Cov and MERS-Cov, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-virus drugs, applicants of immunity, steroids, plasma of recovering patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even plasma should be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in the process of developing antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the early stages of SARS-Cov-2, attacks are mostly light and may be less striking to other authorities pushing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, the disruption of work and the refusal of the respiratory organs are the main threat and cause of the death of patients.
Thus, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive lung ventilation, are crucial to facilitate symptoms and save lives, depending on the gravity of the current disease.
Support in the form of extracorporative membrane oxidization (ECMO), a modified extrapolmonal blood circulation technique used to treat a life- threatening heart or respiratory deficiency is necessary.
Furthermore, maintaining the wet balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septical shock, and protecting vital functions, are essential for patients with SARS-Cov-2.
Cytoquine is known to be the result of the hyperrelation of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
A cytocinal storm is the form of a system-wide inflammation process in response to a series of cytocinists, including TNF mythium, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFNCRP, IRN and MCP-1.
These cytocinates trigger immunocytes into the release of huge quantities of free radicals, which are the main causes of the development of ODS and polyorganic deficiency.
Oppression of immunity is of paramount importance when dealing with cytoquine, especially those with severe patients.
Corticosteroids and thicilymubs, monopolic antibodies, used as interleucine inhibitor, 6 were used to treat cytocinous storms.
Other methods of dealing with cytoquine storm based on immunity control include a simulation of the immunomyal response to control of T-cells; a blockade on the production of cytoquines, IRN-1, and TNF; the suppression of quinnus; the use of blintomamba, cytocinal stimulators; and hystonadecatasis inhibitors.
The steroids are widely used as agents of immunity to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes.
However, steroids in large doses do not benefit from the treatment of severe lung injuries from SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteoporosis, which greatly diminish the forecast.
However, short corticosteroids in small and medium dosages are recommended with caution in treating patients with COVID-19 in critical states.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective antivirus therapy.
However, the internal introduction of a remunition, a nucleotide analog, has proved effective in treating an American patient with COVID-19.
Remducir is a newly developed anti-virus drug originally developed by Gladad to treat the diseases caused by Ebola viruses and the Marburg virus.
Later, the remale also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with one-way RNAs, including MINS and SARS viruses.
Based on this data, Glad provided the Chinese medical team to conduct random studies on patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 and the results are eagerly awaited.
In addition, barnitinib, í-interferon, lognivore/ritovary and fishermen were suggested as options for treatment of patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with raccoon/ritor may be accompanied by diarrhea, toast, rudder, beating of the liver and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other medications designated to patients should be monitored with caution.
The plasma of the sickening and the development of the antitel
Blood collection from patients who have been treated for other patients who suffer from the same disease, or for the protection of a healthy population, has long been used.
And indeed, the blood of the recovering patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
The antibody is in an immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign targets, and they recognize and address individual pathogen molecules.
On this basis plasma from blood samples of a group of patients cured of COVID-19 was released, which was then introduced to 10 seriously ill patients.
During the 24 - hour period, their symptoms improved, inflammation became worse, and blood pressure increased.
However, requiring large-scale use of this method before taking specific treatments requires that there has yet to be an unchecked and unexplained explanation.
Furthermore, given the therapeutic effect, some deficiencies related to plasma use should be carefully studied.
For example, antibodies can be over-enhancing to the immune system and cause cytocinal syndrome, which, given their toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
Blood - containing antitels is usually low, and plasma is often required to treat patients in critical situations.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to identify the B-cells of the recovering patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
That's how we can quickly move on to the mass production of antitel.
For thousands of years, Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on a combination of multiple components of the formula, which varies according to the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have uncertain effects, as it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the main alternative methods of treating patients with mild and moderate symptoms or for patients who develop post-partum disease.
For example, the Su Feng Tse Dou (Shu Feng Jie Du) and the Leang Hu Qing Wen pods (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The largest percentage of curing patients from COVID-19 was reported in a number of provinces in China, where 87 per cent of Chinese traditional treatments, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ninxi (50 per cent) and Hunha (50 per cent), were used in Hubei, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, with the lowest rate (13 per cent).
However, this is quite a rough comparison, since the evaluation should take into account the many other influence factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Bolí Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment only with Western medicine and combined treatment on Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time limits for normalizing the body temperature, eliminating symptoms and providing hospital care were significantly less for patients who were treated in Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients treated only in Western medicine.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients whose symptoms began to deteriorate (from mild to heavy) was markedly lower in the group treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only by Western methods (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficiency and security of Chinese traditional medicine still require more detailed and controlled research on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest to receive, where possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness or combination of components used in traditional Chinese medicine.
Patients who are suspected of or confirmed by COVID-19 are mostly afraid of a acute or even fatal disease, and those who are closed to quarantine are also suffering from boredom, loneliness and extreme frustration.
Moreover, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as by - products such as corticosteroid sleeplessness, can be even more alarming and psychologically stressful.
A number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotoral instigation, psychotic symptoms, deliriums and even suicide, were reported at an early stage of the outbreak of the SARS virus.
The mandatory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, which are among the measures taken by the health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people ' s anxiety and guilt related to the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
Psychiatric and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons suspected of being in contact with them and to all the others who require it.
Psychological support should establish multidisciplinary mental health teams, provide clear and up-to-date information on the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and use professional electronics and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission from infected animals and infected people to receptive hosts and are often used in addition to anti-virus treatments used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines aimed at developing long-lived and highly neutral antitels and (or) protective immunity to SARS-Cov.
In animal research, live, weakened vaccines were developed from the SARS viruses.
However, before the beginning of clinical research, it is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in the natural environment when they are applied to older patients, the death dose infection model and the level of protection against the infection of zoonic viruses.
The reason may be that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
At the same time, controversial cases and clusters of disease caused by the MERS virus originating in the Middle East and spreading to other regions by the conservation of zoonic sources in the habitats of the endemics continue to occur.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed with the use of the estranged virus, DNA plasma, virus vectors, nanoplastic particles, and recombinant protein elements, and some have been assessed for animal use.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-Cov-2 for persons without immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to contain the bouting epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to long-term (an average of 18 months) necessary for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic transformation of the crowns.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical flow of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases patients are able to recover progressively without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also linked to the high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe illness.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a pro-prescriptive model of the disease in order to prioritize their response, especially in areas where there is a lack of resources.
Based on the clinical data presented at the present time, the following factors may affect the forecast of or be associated with a patient with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the flow of disease caused by the SARS virus, which also corresponds to the truth in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 is mainly for patients aged 30 to 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study 8,866 cases.
Patients with intensive therapy were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications and were much older than those who did not require it (on average 66 years compared to 51 years), which suggests that age is a diagnostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-Cov-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Morbidity and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute damage to myocardium and aritmia.
Cardiological phenomena have also been the leading cause of death for patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-Cov-2 could also be linked to ACE2 positive cholera cells, which could result in disruption of liver function to COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and the underlying diseases are closely interrelated and can distort results.
The deviations identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-Reactive protein in the blood reflect the severity of the inflammatory process or damage to tissue and is proposed to be considered as a potential diagnostic factor of the current of the disease, reaction to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that consideration should be given to the relationship between reactive protein levels, the severity of the disease and the forecast at COVID-19.
In addition, the result could also be predicted by an increased lactatde hydrogensase, asparagus-minoporosis, alanine-monoperase and kreatinasis.
In large quantities, these enzymes are allocated to different organs, especially the heart and the liver, and their release occurs when the tissue is damaged.
They are, therefore, traditionally the markers of the heart or the liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: In order to forecast results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, the X-ray of the chest and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are agents of immunity commonly used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with heavy shapes, many of the survivors had developed avascular osteoporosis, which caused permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small dosages and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, many patients suffer from unforeseen and severe stress against the epidemic of COVID-19 because they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the death of their relatives and other patients.
Psychological advice and long-term support must be provided in order to reduce the stress of such patients and to help them return to normal life.
According to demographic studies carried out to date, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory pathways, the SARS-Cov-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that are common to cold diseases, can flourish in the upper respiratory path and produce weak symptoms or do not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who have either an early stage of illness or have not yet completed the incubation period may spread the virus on a large scale, making epidemiological control very difficult.
However, it was believed that SARS-Cov transmission was occurring when patients were very ill, with most of the cases not occurring at an early stage of infection.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe and more difficult to control.
There is now much work in China to declare universal quarantine in Uhana and neighbouring cities, as well as to extend the Carantin regime to almost the entire population in order to break the distribution chain of the SAS-Cov-2 virus.
While these measures have caused enormous economic and other harm to the country ' s life, the number of new patients identified is declining, indicating a slow rate of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak of the disease will end in March, with a period of three to four months.
However, some experts were less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Gunter) and his colleagues calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which appeared to be much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers at the team headed by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-Cov-2 virus might affect two thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-Cov-2 virus was detected in nose and throat strokes collected from patients recovering and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that a new virus could become a cyclic disease similar to influenza.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China was encouraging, pointing out that the strategies currently in place might have had an impact.
Originally, Ebola was expected to affect up to a million people and cause half a million patients to die.
But by strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to be controlled.
It is likely that, like the SARS-Cov virus, an inflammation of the SARS-Cov-2 virus may weaken and will eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus occurring with a human.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Figure 55).
The SARS-Cov-2 virus is characterized by a high transmission rate through coughing or drying, and possibly through direct contact with the virus contaminated material.
The virus was also detected in the potassium, which means that an oral method of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 cases studied may have resulted from hospital infections, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Therefore, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders, who are in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defence in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is the wear of masks for a person; and surgical masks and respirators for class N95 (Series No. 1860s) help to monitor the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent microclips from flying in the air from potentially infected and settle on surfaces from which they can be passed to others.
However, only class N95 masks (series No. 1860s) can protect between 10 to 80 nms from inhalation, they are only missing 5% of the bill; the SARS-Cov-2 virus is the same size as SARS-Cov, and they are both about 85 nm.
Since particles can even penetrate five surgical masks together, doctors who are directly connected to patients must be class N95 (Series No. 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health workers should wear protective robe to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also be caught in the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-Cov-2 even though he wore a class N95 mask; perhaps he was infected with the virus because of inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type protective glasses.
All populations in the affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more often by disinfecting detergents, to keep away from home while respecting isolation, and to limit contact with potentially infected persons.
Admissible distance to a patient is about a meter away.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-Cov-2 virus was previously unknown to humanity, the high level of its similarity with SARS-Cov, as reported on 7 January 2020, was to be a worrying signal for China, taking into account the experience it had gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020 did the Director of the Uhan Center for Disease Control calm the citizens, informing them that the new virus had a low rate of homogeneity and limited reproductiveity, and that prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
That statement had significantly reduced social tensions, particularly in the period when the whole country was preparing for the celebration of the New China Year, and a critical time had been lost when the disease could be kept within the limits of minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, the health authorities should (1) make more cautious public statements, since each word is citizens-sensitive and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) more closely monitor and respond to unusual medical information rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain a potential epidemic at an early stage of its development than to discourage the public; and (4) more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and to regularly verify and improve the public response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the previously unexplored coroner of the heavy respiratory type II syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease spread throughout China and had spread throughout the world at the time of writing.
Because the virus is very similar to the heavy respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-Cov) and the COVID-19 symptoms are similar to those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a sense of relapsion of SARS emerged at the outbreak of COVID-19.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS in terms of controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 is more striking to older persons than young people and men than women; the proportion of serious cases and mortality among older persons is also higher than among young people.
SARS deaths are higher than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is insatiable, whereas SARS patients tend to target people only in serious cases, so it is more difficult to contain COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-Cov-2 is spreading much faster and wider than SARS-Cov.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative common tests for the RNA SARS-Cov-2.
On the other hand, those treated can show positive tests again for the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of the virus.
Against the backdrop of such rapid promotion of COVID-19 research, some key issues remain pending, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-Cov-2 virus?
Despite the detection of 96 per cent homolog between SARS-Cov-2 and two SARS-like coroner mice, we still can't claim that the infection of SARS-Cov-2 was due to bats.
What animal became an intermediate species that passed the virus from the original master, for example, from bat flying to human?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we can't really stop the transfer path, and the epidemiological environment can get worse any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-Cov-2 is linked to ACE2, but how is it that the virus is being implemented into respiratory tracts and is triggering future pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to the ACE2 cells that produce them in other bodies?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in transmission from human to human?
Is it the cause of the world’s pandemic, whether it will disappear as well as SARS or recyclize flu from time to time?
Those aspects were of paramount importance, but it would take time to find answers to those questions and many other questions.
But we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zoonic origin of the crowns of mankind
Muttation and adaptation have encouraged the co-operation of coronavirus (Cov) and their bearers, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coroners (HOV) were known to cause a slight disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life - threatening a person's coronary disease can be.
The appearance of the second-type heavy-spoil respirator (SARS-Cov-2) coroner in central China at the end of 2019 drew attention to coronavirus and surprised us with the high transmission, but less pronounced pathogenic, of the virus than the SAS-Cov native virus.
The Cororous human infection is zoosis, and understanding of its zoo-based origin will be very helpful.
Most of the human crowns come from flying mice for which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate tank vessels of some human crowns are also known.
The definition of animal carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction between the animals that carry the crowns can also shed light on the coroner’s pathogen in humans.
In this review, we present available data on seven human crowns, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoo-based origins and inter-species.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human crowns in terms of viral evolution and genetic recombination.
In this context, the epidemic of the disease caused by coronavirus discovered in 2019 is also under consideration today (COVID-19).
In addition, there are the conditions needed for successful change of wearers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Coronaus belong to the Coronavibe family, which is a group of cloud viruses with a positive and polar RNA thread.
These viruses, with the largest of the MERs containing the genome, ranging from 26 to 32,000 nucleotides, were named because of their form, which, when examined under electronic microscopics, resembles the crown.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain non-segmentated genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open overlaps (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are broadcast into polyproteins of pp1a and pp1b.
These polyproteins are subsequently reprocessed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading framework for structured proteins, including schiposed protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleotene (N).
In other coronavirus lines, a number of linear accelerical proteins are also coded.
Based on the differences in the order of the protein,\ coronerships are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma, and deltakoravirus), with the type of betakoravior, consisting of most of the human crowns and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogological evidence is available that the genetic source of most alpha- and beta-rorogens is the volatile mice and grazs, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltakorarivores.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have been constantly overcome by interspecies, some of which have evolved to the dangers of human pathogens.
To date, seven human crowns have been known.
These include human alpha-depleting HCov-229E and HCOV-NL63.
The remaining five betakoravators include HC43, HCOV-HKU1, SARS-Cov, Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronary syndrome (MERS-Cov) and SARS-Cov-2 severe respiratory emergency coronary syndrome.
Human coronavirates HCov-229E, HC43, HCov-HKU1 and HCov-NL63 typically cause light-shaped symptoms such as cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-Cov viruses, ERS-Cov and recently detected SARS-Cov-2 are extremely pathogens that cause severe lower respiratory infections, with relatively higher numbers of patients with a higher risk of acute respiratory disease (PRDs) and extraterrestrial symptoms.
The first human coroner, HCov-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of a stand-off nasolet of patients with cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has created more detailed knowledge of the HCov-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a widely accepted concept that the conception of human coronary was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were affected and the total mortality rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years after the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the long-term epidemic on the Arabian peninsula has been spreading haphazardly to the rest of the world.
The new human coroner (2019-nCov), who was subsequently renamed SARS-Cov-2 in 2019, was identified as the cause of the current epidemic of coroner infection 2019 (COVID-19), which, as of 3 March 2020, cost more than 3 120 lives and the number of people infected more than 91,000.
The warning signal has been received, and the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-Cov-2 pandemic.
All seven human coroners are zoonic, and their sources are volatile mice, mice or pets.
Many sets of data show that the evolutionary nature of all human coronaviruses from flying mice that have been adapted to and without pathogenic properties of viruses, but show widespread genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has left China and the world a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
A study of the Zoonic mechanism of the origin of human coronerships will help to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting intermodal transport.
It is also likely to advance or accelerate the search for a container, intermediate and amplifying the SARS-Cov-2 wearer, which is very important to prevent a resurgence of the disease in the future.
This review provides general information on Zoonic origin, inter-view transmission and pathogen of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following common feature: the original viruses from which the human corona have occurred are not usually pathogens for their reservoirs, but become pathogenic after the inter-species of the new bear.
We are also looking at the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by reduced pathogens.
In the same context, the result of the current break-out of SARS-Cov-2 is also being considered.
Animals are known since the late 1930s.
Before the strain of B814 HCOV-229E was first obtained from a sample of the nasolets of cold patients, various coronavias were found from various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human crowns have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 presents in an informative and visual way the brief history of detection of human coroner vessels in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCov-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory pathways of patients with infectious effects from the upper respiratory pathways in 1966; subsequently, the virus was adapted to the lines of the WI-38 pulmonary cells.
Patients infected with the HCOV-229E had cold symptoms, including headaches, tea, general infirmity and throat pain, with high temperatures and coughing between 10 and 20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCOV-OC43 virus was removed from the organic culture and the subsequent serial paste into the brain of the sun mice.
The clinical signs of infection by the HCOV-OC43 virus appear to be similar to those of the HCV-229E virus, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable to other pathogens, such as Type A influenza viruses and prinioxies.
Both the HCV-229E and the HCV-OC43 virus are widespread in the world and are generally transmitted in winter at moderate latitudes.
Mostly the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of illness.
According to a volunteer study, healthy people infected with the HCov-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity have been severely infected with the lower respiratory pathways.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the epidemic of typical pneumonia, was the first in human history to be well documented by the pandemic caused by the human coroner, and the causer of the disease was the SAS-Cov virus, the third of the detectable human coronaviruses.
The first SARS case was detected in the Chinese province of Guangun in late 2002.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were recorded, and the disease spread in many countries and across continents.
Without taking into account superactive proliferators, it was estimated that each patient could have an estimated two more; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days and the peak of the virus was 10 days of illness.
The patients with SARS-Cov initially had muscle pain, headaches, high temperatures, general failure and chilling, and among the later symptoms were obsolescence, cough and respiratory deficiency.
The laboratory deviations from the SARS standard are lymphops, liver disturbances and the higher kreetinasa level.
Patients with SARS also suffer malfeeding of alveolar damage, licipation of epithelial cells and rise of macrophages.
About 20 to 30 per cent of patients subsequently need intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such serious cases, other organs may be infected, in addition to the lower respiratory pathways, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney organs, usually accompanied by cytocinin storms, which may be summer, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
For the first time, the virus was released from the open biopsy of a minor patient’s relative who arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made to explore human coronerships.
At the end of 2004, HCOV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
First, it was found that it was mainly affecting young children, older persons and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory diseases.
The diseases caused by HCov-NL63 are characterized by snags, silencing, high temperatures and broncholite.
Another independent study describes the selection of the same virus from an 8-month-old boy in the Netherlands who suffers from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
HCOV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases and for peaks of diseases caused by them at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is connected to an elaborate laringitate, which is also called a kross.
HCOV-HKU1 was allocated in Hong Kong in the same year to 71-year-old men who were hospitalized with pneumonia and bronze.
In addition to non-malmonal pneumonia and broncholitis, HCov-HKU1 are linked to the upsurge in asthma.
Like HCov-NL63, HCov-229E and HC43, the HCov-HKU1 virus, which produces respiratory diseases of light shape, has been detected worldwide.
All of these four human coronerships, which are causing incurable infections, have been well adapted to people, and their mutation resulting in high-pathous diseases is usually unlikely, although their causes are not known as in the rare example of a more incurable subtype of HCov-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has led to a serious lower respiratory infection in China.
Usually, an acquired ability to communicate effectively and to remain in the body, these human crowns become less curled or downplated.
The coroner of the Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS-Cov) was first released in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal deficiency.
Most of the laboratoryly confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, import and distribution cases have been recorded with close contact.
Another secondary outbreak, with 186 confirmed cases, occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal deficiency, which thus far distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronavirus transmitted to humans.
More than 30 per cent of patients have stomach-to-oxidant symptoms, such as diarrhea and rudder.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratoryly confirmed cases of the Middle East high-death respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent) were reported, and MINS-Cov was therefore considered one of the most lethal human-known viruses.
From mid-19 to the end of December 2019, Hubey, China, discovered patient clusters of pneumonia, which are now linked to an infection caused by the coronary of the 2nd type of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The World Health Organization has declared that the continued outbreak of the low respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-Cov-2 is a global public health emergency and itself is referred to as “Corogenic infection 19” (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide, accounting for approximately 3.4 per cent of deaths.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in Hubei China is 4.2 per cent and outside 1.2 per cent.
SARS-Cov-2, like the SARS and MERS coroners, produces a heavy respiratory infection characterized by temperature rise, cough and dust.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Penetration is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become respiratory deficiency syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82 per cent), these viruses nevertheless form different phylonetic tree branches.
CARS-Cov-2 is apparently less pathogenic but has a greater transfer capacity than SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov.
There have been recorded cases of unsubstantial infections of SARS-Cov-2, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly throughout the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-Cov-2 with six other human crowns reveals important similarities and differences.
First, the transmissions to the person of the coronary have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-Cov-2 is showing the same trend as the remaining six human coronaviruses.
Second, by the severity of COVID-19 symptoms, there are between SARS-Cov and four human coronaviruses causing non-abuse infections (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-Cov-2 infections are similar to those most common when infected with human coroner viruses that cause non-participant infections, including non-specific events, mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, like SARS-Cov infection, a small sub-group of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, there are also interesting patterns in the transfer of SARS-Cov-2, which are characteristic of both the human coronary coronary infections that cause non-munitions infections and the SARS-Cov.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses that cause non-munitions.
On the other hand, it is still to be checked whether the transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 is decreasing with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e., infection of each of the following individuals), as in the case of SARS-Cov and Meres-Cov.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses causing incurable infections, SARS-Cov-2 can be found in coffee samples.
We have yet to answer the question as to whether the feces-ordinary route of the SARS-Cov-2 is as significant (at least in certain circumstances) as it was in the case of SARS-Cov.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-Cov-2, which is characteristic of human coronates that cause extra-blown infections.
However, future development of the continued COVID-19 will depend on the characteristics of SARS-Cov-2, including transferability, density and sustainable dissemination after human transition.
All four human coroneracs, producing non-patient infections with mild symptoms, have been well adapted to people.
On the other hand, they may well have adapted to these four human crowns.
In other words, both could be called the only survivors of the pandemic of human coronerships in the past.
Human coronerships, which cause serious illness in humans, and people with coronaviruses causing severe diseases simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in the human body to the extent that there is a accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the wearer's restraint.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-Cov-2 flash will continue and the more people will be infected, the greater the chance that the virus will be fully adapted to the human being.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult for people to stop by quarantine or other control measures for infectious diseases.
For many years, four out-of-breath coronauruss, which are common in people with healthy immunity, have spread among the population.
These viruses are not required by the animal resurbure.
SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov have not adapted well enough to the human being, and their transmission to the people cannot be supported.
They need to stay and multiply in their zoo-based reservoirs and find cases of human exposure, perhaps through one or more intermediate or reinforced wearers.
SARS-Cov-2 has features like the SARS-Cov/MERS-Cov and the four HCOV non-contamination viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as off-board HCOV, at least currently.
But it's more pathogenic than HCOV-free, and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MINS-Cov.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts fully to man and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a container or with an intermediate carrier animal.
Before we discuss the animal origin of the HCOV viruses, we will benefit from discussing the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and reservoir-based HCOV viruses.
The animal is an evolutionary carrier of HCov if it carries a close-born ancestor with the same high homologies at a nucleotide sequence.
The preventative virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in the wearer.
Similarly, the resurvey bearer is constantly carried over the HCOV for a long time.
In both cases, wearers are naturally infected and are natural HCov carriers or their parent virus.
In contrast, if HCOV was only absorbed in the intermediate wearer right before or about the time when it was hit by a man, it was not well adapted to the new bear and is often pathogened.
This intermediate bear can serve as a zoo-based source of human infection and play the role of a reinforcing wearer by allowing the lightning virus to reproducing and then passed it on to people by increasing the spread of human infection.
HCov may transpose a dead end of the infection if it cannot withstand the transfer inside the intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCOV viruses may also adapt to the intermediate holder and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate bear becomes a natural tank bearer.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that a zero patient, SARS, had had contact with animal hunting (baby).
Further research on sero-validity has shown that animal dealers have an IgG-to-SARS-Cov prevalence higher than the population as a whole.
The Himalayan cives (Paguma larvata) and the cenotide dog in the animal markets were the first to be identified as the first viruses similar to and almost identical to the SARS-Cov.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that the SARS cases were no longer reported after the destruction of all the cigarettes in the markets.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayans, living in nature or on farms that did not reach markets, had in most cases not been defined, which concluded that the Himalayans could serve only as an intermediate energy source rather than a natural SARS-Cov reservoir.
Notably, since 80 per cent of the various animals in Guangzhou market have antibodies for SARS-Cov, the likelihood that multiple types of small mammals can also be used as intermediate reinforcing wearers cannot be ruled out.
They all seem to be the dead end end of the SARS-Cov virus.
The subsequent search for a natural SARS-Cov animal revealed a closely related CoV fly mice, which has been described as a coronation-related coronary coronary of HKU3 fly mice (SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3) and which is present in Chinese submarine mice.
These mice are positive on the antibodies to SARS-Cov and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3.
These and other crowns of bats have the same homologies for nucleotides as SARS-Cov.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats became bearers of new human pathogens.
The flying mice also identified several SARS-like crowns (SL-Cov), but none of them, except one that stands for WIV1, cannot be isolated as a living virus.
The receptor SARS-Cov is known to be human angiotensin-to-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, obtained from a sample of falcal bat, was shown to use ACE2 bat, cythet and human as input receptor for cell entry.
It's interesting that the serums of the recyclable patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date WIV1 represents the closest ancestral ancestor, SARS-Cov, in flying mice, separating 95 per cent of the homologies of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homologies between the two viruses, WIV1 is generally not considered to be a direct parent virus, SARS-Cov, and the bat is not a direct SAS-Cov tank vessel.
The phigogenic analysis is assigned to MERS-Cov in the same group as CoV-HKU4 bat, and CoV-HKU5 bat.
CoV-HKU4 bat and MERS-Cov use the same wearer receptor, diptylpyptide-4 (DPP4) to infiltrate viruses.
MERS-CoV phlognetically closer to the bio-narcodioxic mice detected in Europe and Africa, the RNA dependent RNA polymers sequence of the MERS-Cov virus.
So far, wild bats have not found a living MERS-Cov virus.
The homologic nucleotide sequences of MEERS-Cov and his immediate relative CoV-HKU25 fly mice coincided with only 87%.
That is, flying mice might not be a direct MERS-Cov reservoir carrier.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have shown that single camels are seropositive to neutralized antitels specific to MEERS-CoV, as well as those of Middle East origin in many African countries.
MERS-Cov, identical to the human virus, was identified from the nasal camel strokes of a single camel, which further confirms the role of camels as the true MERS-Cov reservoirs.
It is also worth noting that camels that have been experimented with by MERS-Cov have had slight symptoms but massive virus.
It is noteworthy that the infected camels provided the virus not only with respiratory but also in the fecal and oral way, which is also the main way of identifying the virus with bats.
However, questions still remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome have not had an anaesthetic contact with camels prior to the occurrence of symptoms and are likely to be attributed to human transmission or to the transmission by unknown channels involving unidentified species of animals that are carriers of MEERS-CoV.
The nucleotide homologies SARS-Cov-2 by 96.2% are the same as the CoV RaTG13 flight mice assigned from the Asian submarine Rhinophus affinis.
As with the SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov cases, the intercomparison between SARS-Cov-2 and RATT13 is too large to attribute to them parental relations.
That is, flying mice could not be the direct SARS-Cov-2 tank vessel unless in the future the almost identical coroner of bats was found.
The direct animal carriers of the SARS-Cov-2 virus are expected to be among the wild species sold and killed in the coal bulk market for seafood, which was associated with many initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates a possible transmission from an animal.
A number of recent studies based on metagenomal separation have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also carry the parent betakoravior, the SARS-Cov-2 family strain.
The homology of the sequence of nucleotides of these new coroner genes, 85 to 92 per cent, coincides with SARS-Cov-2.
But they are also closely linked to RaTG13, with the identity at the nucleotide sequence of about 90 per cent.
They are classified in two branches of differentiation of viruses such as SARS-Cov-2 in a phylovenian tree, one of which has a receptor-linking domain (SRD) closer to SARS-Cov-2 with the identity of amino acid sequence of 97.4 per cent.
On the contrary, the RSDs of SARS-Cov-2 and RATG13 are more divided, despite the higher homologies of consistency in the entire genome.
An earlier study of pathogens also reported on the definition of viral contages in lung samples that were similar to those of SARS-Cov-2.
Other methods of assembly and hand-processing were used in the study to obtain a genome sequence of about 86.3 per cent of the full-scale virus genome.
It cannot be ruled out that the pangolin has become one of the intermediate SARS-Cov-2 animals.
However, as a result of the intercomparison of the sequence between SARS-Cov-2 and the pangoline bithorogirists of SARS-Cov2, there is currently no evidence to support direct origin of SARS-Cov-2 from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-Cov-2 and RATG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-Cov-2 and the pathogens associated with SARS-Cov-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-Cov-2 is not yet established by flying mice, Pakistanis and other mammals.
While the highest homologies of sequence were found in the RSDs between SARS-Cov-2 and the pancurogens beakorogenes of SARS-Cov-2, SARS-Cov-2 and RaTG13 are the highest homologies of sequences throughout the genome.
Very theoretically, the high level of reference between the pancreas of SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov-2 relates to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The counter-proposal proposal was in favour of recombination between the bitakoravirus ofangers born of SARS-Cov-2 and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among the betakorogyrus.
The final decision on the direct zoonic origin of SARS-Cov-2 is not yet in place.
In addition to high-pathogenic HCov viruses, the Zoon-based origin of HCov-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Philogenic evidence shows that both HCov-NL63 and HCov-229E can occur from the crowns of volatile mice, while parent viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 are found in grazins.
It has been reported that the coroner of flying mice, known as ARCOV.2, (Appalachian Ridge CoV), discovered in North America’s tricolored bedstead, shows a close kinship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E is genetically linked to another crown of flying mice called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate bearer might also have been camels.
For the sake of clarity, the modern animal knowledge of the origin of known coronarys is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
The philogenic analysis provided proof of the events of the HCov inter-view transmission in Anasene.
When the HCOV-OC43 virus was transmitted to people about 1890, the respiratory pandemic was registered.
The history of HCov-229E inter-view is not so clear.
Alpha crustorogens of flying mice, close to HCOV-229E, were found.
Between them lies the alpha - colored alpaca.
Some data supports direct transmission of the virus from flying mice.
First, it was humans, not the alpacas, who could contact the flying mice in the overall environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpacas.
Secondly, the alpha-quorogens of flying mice born in HCov-229E are diverse and non-patogenic in bats, while the alpha-corodor alpacas have caused a respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-quoise alpaca was not found in wild animals.
Thus, the probability that the alpacas received the alpha-quorogen of HCOV-229E from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, flying mice are a direct source of pathogenic human viruses, including the white blood virus, the Ebola virus, the Nippah virus and the Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that flying mice could directly transmit the HCOV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while alpha crustariums of flying mice could serve as a wild pool of HCov-229E virus, alpines and camels could become intermediate bearers that transmit viruses to people, just as in the case of the MERS-Cov virus.
MERS-Cov provides a fine example of inter-view transmission from the flying mice to the unicorn camels and from the single camels of a man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-Cov virus from flying mice is known from its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent research.
It is clear that flying mice provide a rich pool of viruses for interspecies exchange and interspecies.
The years, the densely populated colonies, the close social interaction and the ability to fly make the bats “ideal proliferators”.
On the other hand, the MERS-Cov virus was given to camels decades ago.
He has adapted well to these camels, which from the intermediate carrier have become a stable and natural container.
These animals have a very mild MERS-Cov virus and have a relatively low mutation frequency.
His occasional transfer of a person is an accident, and the human being remains a dead end to MERS-Cov, as his transfer is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MEERS-Cov, the role ofangers, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
The pancreas, in particular, are highly pathogened.
They may be endogenous to the SARS-Cov-2s, as well as cytites in the case of SARS-Cov.
In future studies, it is necessary to confirm or exclude several possibilities for inter-divisional transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus from the animal.
First, flying mice can be a tank vessel for the virus related to SARS-Cov-2, almost identical to SARS-Cov-2.
People can share the environmental niche with flying mice by carbing or cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Secondly, the pangots can be one of the intermediate amplifiers to which the native SARS-Cov-2 has recently contracted the virus.
Humans are infected with the virus through carcases and the use of wild animals for food.
SARS-Cov-2 may well have a lot of animals, including domestic animals.
An antibody survey of domestic and wild animals is justified.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-Cov-2 could have occurred in the third form, which was in contact with both the bat and the pangolins.
The search for animal origin is ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal wearers, the three main factors on the part of viruses have also contributed to the crossing of inter-species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared with other one-chained RNA viruses, the estimated frequency of coronary mutations can be considered “intention-high” with an average replacement frequency of approximately 10 to 4 replacements per year at one section 2, depending on the adaptation phase of the coronary to new masters.
Coronaurus have a correcting exorbitonucle, the removal of which results in an extremely high frequency of mutationization and weakening or even non-sustainability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog Remdexir suppresses the replica of coronarys by inhibiting this exorbitonucles and the dependent RNAs.
Remdissire is one of the most promising anti-SARS-Cov-2 tools to be tested in clinical research.
Nevertheless, the frequency of coronary mutations is nearly a million times higher than their bearers.
Furthermore, the frequency of mutation can often be even higher if the crowns are not sufficiently adapted to the wearer.
Compared to SARS-Cov, which is highly mutations, the SARS-Cov-2 mutations are probably lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to people.
This virus has probably already adapted to another carryer close to a person.
In addition to SARS-Cov-2, this also applies to MEERS-Cov, well adapted to camels per se.
It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and anti-virus drugs from SARS-Cov-2 will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in the coronavis has resulted in a more plastical modification of mutations with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-spective takeovers that are conducive to the emergence of new coronavrus, subject to conditions.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open-ended reading and function of proteins encoded in the direction of the 3-* end of the genome.
Third, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, crowns are by accident and often switched over during RNA replication.
During the transcryptation of the coroner’s DNA in the wearer, which serves as a dilution receptacle, the thread is often switched over.
High-diversity and sub-genic RNAs can recombinate and create new corona.
The phygogenic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCov-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in coronary animals, such as SL-Cov and betaCov-HKU9 flying mice.
Interacting of the transmission virus
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, another key factor important for inter-view transmission is the interaction of the virus with the receptor of the wearer.
This article is a typical example, which also demonstrates positive selection in inter-species events, and is given as a recombination by SARS-Cov.
Based on comparative analysis between SARS-Cov human strains and cyvettes, SARS-Cov is considered to be undergoing rapid adaptation in different media, especially with regard to SWD stimulant selves.
In general, S coronaurus Proteins interact with the cellular receptor and the wearer ' s antibody response is intensively selected.
RSD at SARS-Cov is an amino acids, 318th to 510th, per S1 section, which is linked to human angiotensensensor 2 (APF2) for the introduction of the virus in the cell, as well as its corceptors.
RSD SAS-Cov has the capability to recognize APF2 receptors from different animals, including bats, cyvettes, mice and cenotoid dogs, making it possible to transmit the virus in an inter-species manner.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in RSDs, which are different from the human virus strains and cyvettes, of which 4 are in the receptor for interaction with the PPF2 receptor.
SARS-Cov cythetes have mutations of K479N and S487T in RSD, which can increase the affinity of schip protein interactions with human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two substitutes for amino acids can be particularly important for adapting the virus to a human.
It is worth noting that SARS-Cov-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-Cov.
The difference of 30% between SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov in S1 segment of S protein has led to the possible change in the relationship of S protein to human APF2.
Indeed, a study by cryoelectron microscopy says that the affinity of this connection is 10-20 times higher than between the APF2 and the S S virus SAS-Cov protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other proofreaders were needed for the transfer of SARS-Cov-2.
It is surprising that HCov-NL63 also links to APF2, but to another segment of S protein.
There are many other HCov receptors, such as N amnoptide for HCov-229E and 9-O-accetylene acid for HCov-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronary vessels in the people after inter-species have been transferred from domestic animals.
In addition to celebratory receptors, the result of HCov inter-species is also managed by other factors of weariness and limitations.
Dives of these proteins between humans and natural HCVs reservoirs, such as bats, camels and grazs, may constitute a barrier to inter-species.
For successful inter-divisional transmission of HCOV viruses, it is necessary to take advantage of dependency factors and to submit itself to media response factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important interface between the virus and the wearer still need to be defined and categorised.
Good results can be achieved by an impartial, complete screening of the dependence and response factors of the media for SARS-Cov-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
Getting new HCov back to zero
The diversity of bat crowns creates a wide potential for new HCovs.
In this sense, bat crowns serve as a genetic pool for HCov.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recovery are also a driving force for the evolution of HCOV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new proteins coding genes has the potential to radically modify phenotype viruses.
Among the acustrolic proteins, SARS-Cov is important for adapting people to ORF8 because the bats of the flying mice of SARS-Cov have been isolated but found to code ORF8 strange proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-ycleotid mission, which is characteristic of the coronaces of SARS-Cov, was found.
This delegation breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered to be adaptive mutation, which accelerates shift of bearers.
In addition, SARS-Cov has a history of possible recombinations with lines of alpha- and gamma-carrivores, where a large number of smaller reccombinant sites have been identified in the RNA-dependent RNA-Policy.
Recombination is also found in unstructured proteins nsp9, most of themp10 and parts nsp14.
It has similarly been shown that the epidemiological MERS-Cov has been subject to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, recombinant events were also observed in other HCOVs where HCov was recombined with other animal coronarys in its unstructured genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial breeding may lead to unintended changes in viral genes, which are likely to result from the removal of the virus from the plant pressure, such as from the wearer ' s immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-scale ORF4 in the prototype HCov-229E strain by a two-to-cell division.
While the intact open-reading box of ORF4 can be seen in flying mice and camel viruses related to HCov-229E, the alpha crust of the alpaca shows a single nucleotoid box, which causes a shift of the frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCOV is also due to the selection pressure on their reservoirs.
Poorly expressed symptoms or lack of symptoms were recorded in the contamination of bat crowns by coroner, indicating mutual adaptation between crowns and bats.
It turns out that flying mice are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, inflammation defects in flying mice effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cages in flying mice is suppressed by an inflammatory receptor of natural killer cells, NKG2/CD94, and the low rate of exposure of molecules of the main complex histocompatibility I complex.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen, which is ensured by high metabolic activity in flying mice, may suppress the replica of the coronavor while at the same time affecting the reading of exorbonucleosis, thus creating a selection pressure to generate the strains of the virus which, when entering the new wearer, are high-potential.
The more pathogenic strains of the coroner may also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the wearer.
Thus, it is no coincidence that over the past 20 years, three new coronary men have appeared.
Cornogens are not pathogens, or they cause mild symptoms in their reservoirs, such as bats or camels.
They're definitely replicating without causing a strong immune response from the wearer.
This is the secret to why we see insensible bearers and that causes serious human infections.
Heavy symptoms are related mainly to the hyperpersing of the immune response and the cytoquine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the greater the hit of the lungs.
On the contrary, it does not involve the replica of the coroner for the insatiable bearers.
The same non-immunal response strategy can have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-Cov-2.
The flying mice have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, the type 1 interferon, at least during the initial phase of SARS-Cov-2 infection, must have a beneficial effect.
In addition, flying mice have a violation of NLRP3-inflammoma.
On this basis, the inflammation of NLRP3-inflammoma with MCC-250 may be useful for COVID-19 treatment.
The emergence of SARS-Cov-2 follows the common pattern of SARS-Cov and MINS-Cov.
While it was found that flying mice had been found to have a nucleotide homologies of 95% that coincided with SARS-Cov, there was also a coroner of flying mice whose nucleotide homologies coincided with 96% with SAS-Cov-2.
Although cives and other animals on markets were found to carry viruses identical to SARS-Cov, no directly intermediate bearers for SARS-Cov-2 were installed.
The pangolin betakorosaurs, amazingly homological SARS-Cov-2, were found, indicating that the pangolins could serve as an intermediate wearer, or that fragments of the bitakoravosauric genes could enter the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Despite the remaining issues, there is no evidence that SARS-Cov-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by a human.
Coronaus have attracted general attention because of the recent outbreak of SARS-Cov-2.
The study of crowns from bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonics and reservous animals in human transmission.
The convincing evidence has been that SARS-Cov, RES-Cov and SARS-Cov-2 are from the flying mice and have been transmitted to the human person through intermediate bearers.
If SARS-Cov infection occurs between people and cyvettes in markets, closing the diocese markets and destroying the cytium could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of various pathogens of pancreas, closely related to SARS-Cov-2, the pathogens should be removed in order to prevent zoonic transmission of infections from the product markets.
However, whether SARS-Cov-2 is passed on to individuals through Pakistanis and other mammals, and how this can continue to be the task of future research.
The MERS-Cov virus, on the other hand, existed for a long time in a single camel.
The camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MEERS, as has been done in China ' s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2.
In order to stop MERS periodically, an integrated approach must be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-Cov for camels combined with other communicable control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, there may be new genetics that are causing outbreaks of the disease.
The world is full of zoos of zoos.
In particular, the crowns of flying mice with zoo-like potential are extremely varied.
There are many opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonic crowns, which in the future will create new crowns that are more easily passed and (or) more deadly for man.
To reduce excessive contact between humans and animals, a culture of animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned.
Following the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be seized.
While many of the characteristics of flying mice are favourable to the spread of viruses, if you train people to stay away from them, you can minimize the likelihood of having contact with flying mice and other species of wild animals.
In order to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, there is a need for continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronavor from humans and future outbreaks of disease.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent zonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of the zoonic virus.
The SARS-Cov-2 puzzle still lacks some fragments.
First, if flying mice have passed the SARS-Cov-2 longline virus, it is interesting to see under what circumstances flying mice and pangoons have divided the same environmental niche.
Second, if flying mice play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how people have been in contact with the bat.
Third, if the role of the true intermediate medium is to be played by the third mammal, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pancreas.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be sensitive to SARS-Cov-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
Whether it's a bat, pangolin or other mammals, it is expected that in the future, SARS-Cov-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified from their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-Cov-2 on animals, which will have important implications for human prevention and control of COVID-19.
The diagnostic criteria for “suggested cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID 19 need to be updated
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief reference manual on diagnosis and treatment of the new coronary infection 2019 (2019-nCov), which provides information on our experience and provides correct guidance on the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
However, coronaviral infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for “suggested cases” and “confirmed cases”, in accordance with the recommendation on diagnostic and treatment for COVID-19 (seventh version), issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
A new coroner of 2019 (2019-nCov), now officially named coronavian infection 2019 (CVID-19), occurred in December 2019, while the virus itself was described as “a severe acute respiratory syndrome of 2” (SARS-COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the infection, our group developed a short reference manual and published it on the website of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication received great attention.
Let us note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven editions of the Recommendation on diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19, issued by the National Committee on Health of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), were issued, with some of its provisions significantly changing.
Recently, comments were made on our recommendations in the work of Zhou (Zhou) with co-sponsors, containing simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and also provided valuable background information on the pandemic, which has spread throughout the world.
We reaffirm the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19 (test seventh version), and on the basis of ongoing research, their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of the document (3 March 2020), a comprehensive analysis of the case of suspected disease must be combined with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of transfers or placements in Uhahan and its surroundings or other settlements where there have been reported cases of COVID-19 within 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with patients infected with SAVE-Cov-2 (with a positive test based on nucleinic acid); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperatures or respiratory symptoms from. Uhhan and its surroundings or other human settlements, where there have been incidents of COVID-19 during the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (> 2 cases with high temperatures or respiratory symptoms recorded during 2 weeks at small sites, such as home or apartment, office, class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperatures and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external infections of COVID-19; (3) the total number of white blood cells is normal or reduced with fewer lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for the confirmed case should be based on a case of suspicion of a disease with one of the following points of pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-Cov-2; (2) full-gencerization of the virus shows a high degree of strength with respect to the new coronaviruses; (3) the positive serodes results for the SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM and IgG; or the change in the result of the positive test for the SAS-Cov-2-IgG antibodies specific, or an increase of at least four times the rate of recovery for the acute phase.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) releases of this document, a real-time PCR test for nuclein acids in respiratory or blood samples was added.
The pathogenic diagnostics of blood samples were added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions, and the need for serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal set for the detection of nuclear acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as to analyse samples derived from respiratory pathways, including blood samples, which improves the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the diagnosis criteria.
There is, however, increasing evidence of the need to be cautious in treating patients with a common symptom and unmarked symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou (Zhou) et al., should be updated since it classified persons with no clinical symptoms as a group of “low risk”.
The evaluation system also needs clarification in further clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments behind.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suggested cases of disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations in the countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19 - maximum daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 a day.
That's the largest number of deaths a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the registered cases included 114 current cases, as well as 33 surviving patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In the online press, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, Director of IEDCR, reported that four men and a woman had been victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two deaths were over 60, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID 19 pandemic.
The clinic staff member informed the local news agency Anadola that one of the victims was Jalal Saifer Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Maytri Kuwaiti clinic.
On Saturday, on an online video release, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obaidul Kwader, stated that public transport would be terminated for longer than originally planned until the next Saturday.
The public transport work was stopped on 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of basic necessities — medicines, fuel, and food — was still permitted.
The first COVID-19 infections were reported on 8 March in Bangladesh by two people who had returned from Italy as well as their wife.
As of 19 March, the three people had recovered.
CARS-Cov-2 has crossed a million-dollar infections around the world
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, the total number of cases of coronation by the SARS-Cov-2 was more than one million worldwide on Thursday.
At least 52,000 people were killed by the COVID-19 coroner.
Reuben arrived on the same day when the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and Zambia recorded the first death from the coronavirus.
North Korea claimed that it was one of the few countries that had not reported cases of coroner infection as of Thursday.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 incidents in the twenty-four hours preceding 1000 Central European times (800UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronaviral contamination were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to the University of Jones Hopkins, reported that more than 1,000 deaths were recorded on Wednesday in the United States due to coronavibic infection.
Countries around the world have announced increased measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, the Mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobian, extended the regime of self-determination of citizens of the city until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin had previously stated that the Russians throughout the country, despite their isolation, would be paid until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of the extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of the vote was 215 “for”, 10 abstentions and one “resist”.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas earlier the curfew lasted only from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce curfews from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The U.S. Governor, Ohio, Mike Daoin, announced that the state house self-insolution regime had been extended by order until May 1.
Stores in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian networks of Wallworths and Colosse stores reduced the number of toilet paper packages that could be purchased at one time in all the country's shops, to two and one package, respectively.
On Monday ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions were reported in cash announcements, as well as on the Facebook page.
Citizens are said to have started to make emergency stocks because of the fear that COVID-19 may lead to the introduction of a general self-insolation regime.
The Wallworths network also restricted the quantity of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Previously, on 4 and 5 March, respectively, Volorths and Coles had already restricted this quantity to 4 packages.
The Colles trade network, in a press release dated 8 March, reported that, with a restriction on four packages, “many toilet paper shops are still being purchased too fast — one delivery within an hour,” and called such a demand “unforeseen”, while ALDI in Facebook, published on Tuesday, called the trend “unforeseen”.
According to the representative of Wallworths, last week there was a sharp rise in sales.
Costco's shop in Canberra last week also restricted that quantity to two packages.
In order to fill the deficit, Colles began ordering suppliers with larger shipments and increasing the frequency of supplies, Wallworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made reserves for a special stock of early sales by Wednesday.
Russell Romerman, executive director of the Australian Ryyyler Association, reported that Rynilers were trying to supplement stocks, but this was difficult because local authorities were limited in their vehicle travel schedule.
He looked forward to increasing the cost of products because suppliers were trying to meet demand, but fewer and fewer value-added offers were available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of the depletion of stocks, some stores are unable to conduct environmental stock.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer expert from Queensland University of Technology, said that shops were filling up every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky commodity, so the stock was small, and after the sale of the entire product, the long rows of floors remained empty, increasing the feeling of lack of stock.
“Colos and Wolworths believe that if fields could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers would probably not have panicked,” says Russell Timerman.
During the past Wednesday, the manufacturer of the reprocessing toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, reported the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex toilet paper manufacturer and Solaris Paper, also manufactured by Sorent, reported that they were operating 24 hours a day to provide sufficient supplies.
Domain.com, the real estate sales site, reported that when auctions in Melbourne declined due to the absence of buyers of the Labour Day Week, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first auctioners.
The Thursday issue of the daily NT News printed in Darwin included a tab of eight pages designed to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia report of 3 March, first the shops were reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, stating that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Romerman added that other products also use increased demand, including medical masks, disinfectants, galintera, hand washing, and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the online contagion of the British Ocado supermarket had also restricted the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID 19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of communicable disease (COVID-19) caused by the coronary of SARS-Cov-2.
Although the term “Pandemia” refers only to the extent of the disease rather than to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to take measures:
“All countries together are still able to influence the progress of the pandemic”.
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate the sick, monitor the occurrence of the disease and mobilize their citizens, ” explained Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus, Director-General of WHO.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming prevalence and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unforeseen”.
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that “a single respiratory virus other than influenza has not yet been tracked from the moment it emerged to a continuous global distribution”.
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that “we never observed the pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled.”
First, in January, WHO declared the disease an international public health emergency and then a pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, said about the outbreak: “It's just a beginning, it's going to get worse.”
According to Associated Press on Thursday in the world, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported, more than 4,600 people died.
The coroner's pandemic of 2019-2020 is now the coroner's coronary disease of 2019 (CVID-19) caused by the coroner of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uhan, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 the international public health emergency, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic, on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, 210 countries and regions recorded approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 disease, killing some 97,000 people.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
China has a mortality rate of 4 per cent, while the world varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and heavy breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory respirator disss syndrome.
From the first symptoms to the peak of the disease, it is usually about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
At present, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and the recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering coughing, keeping the distance between people, and identifying and ensuring self-insolating individuals suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by imposing restrictions on travel, quarantine, curfews, workplace risk control and closures.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic consequences for the transport or elimination of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as widespread shortages of goods exacerbated by panic-procurement purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's students.
There have been instances of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people who remind them of their appearance, as well as other groups of people living in areas where there have been significant cases of the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions decreased as a result of reduced travel and closures of heavy industries.
On 31 December 2019, the public health authorities of the town of Huhaang, the capital of Hobey, China, reported that there had been incidents of pneumonia with an unknown cause and an investigation had begun in early January 2020.
The cases of contamination were mostly related to the wholesale market of Huangan seafood, so the virus is believed to have a zoo-based origin.
The virus that triggered the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-Cov-2, which is a recently discovered virus that resembles a great number of bat crowns, coronaviruses of the pangoline and SARS-Cov. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not attend the market after that date.
Two thirds of the infections reported in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, in the south-China branch of the newspaper The Morning Post, whose information was not verified, it was suggested that the first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident in Hubei province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China had declined but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that the number of new infections outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases may be significantly underestimated, in particular because of the many cases with weakly expressed symptoms.
By 26 February, there were relatively few cases of infection among young people, with 19-year-old and younger patients accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide, and the United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallans, calculated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until an effective group immunity was created in the country.
Statistics include cases of infection of people tested on COVID-19 and whose test was positive in accordance with official records.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had adopted a formal policy requiring that testing should be done with only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that 86 per cent of the cases of COVID-19 were not detected in China before 23 January, and that such unregistered patients became a source of infection for 79 per cent of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of base reproductive infection (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this might be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are well-equipped.
In other, more complex cases, from the start of symptoms to the moment of death, there were between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent period being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, some 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over the age of 60, while 75 per cent of deaths were related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include data on deaths of patients with positive results from COVID testing performed under the official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher because official figures may not take into account dead people who have not been tested — for example, in the case of death at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID figures from 4 to 5 times.
The U.S. Spokesperson for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes: “We know that [the claimed number of deaths] is below actual.” His words are confirmed by reports of certain single cases in the United States; this is often the case with pandemics, such as the G1N1 pig influenza epidemic, which was recorded in Uhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded in the Philippines on 1 February and outside Asia on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents other than Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods were usually used to measure mortality.
All indicators vary according to the region and the time of the disease; they are also influenced by the level of testing, the quality of health systems, the use of treatment schemes, the time from the beginning of the outbreak of the disease and the population ' s parameters, such as age, gender and general health, with the mortality/ morbidity factor representing the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed infections over a given period of time.
According to statistics provided by the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 10 April 2020, the total number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97,039/1,617,204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the ratio of mortality to morbidity declined from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the definition of the rate of mortality due to illness (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from disease and the percentage of deaths from infection (IFR) - which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from disease.
These statistics are time-bound and reflect the figures of certain population groups from the time of contamination to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to figure out these figures for specific groups of people.
The Oxford University Evidence Centre estimates that deaths from the pandemic in general range from 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The upper number of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as a statistical study analysing the impact of the CFR test.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
Sand and exact flash duration are not identifiable and may differ according to location.
Macei Bonie, a staff member at the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to go to the plateau and then, when the number of available carriers ends, they extinguish.
However, in the current situation, it is virtually impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will occur.”
The Chinese Government's Senior Medical Adviser, Zyong Nanjang, argues that “all can end by June” if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to end the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucarski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-Cov-2 “will circulate for perhaps a year or two”.
According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) is established, physical distance and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a staff member at the University of Vanderbilt, believes: “I don't think that this coronary will ever disappear, because it's so easily transmitted,” and that it “can turn into a seasonal disease every year.”
The vulture of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may undergo the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are elevated temperatures (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetness in the respiratory pathway (if any), the loss of absorptive, absorptive, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headaches, chilling, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or cyanos. WHO claims to be seriously affected with the development of respiratory problems of about 1 in every 6 persons.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms such as respiratory problems, permanent pain or chest fatigue, sudden sense of unconsciousness, difficulty in waking up and inflammating a person or mouth, and these symptoms should be immediately followed by medical attention, and the further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may be exposed to a disease without clinical evidence, but the results of the tests confirm the infection, and therefore doctors recommend that persons in close contact with patients diagnosed with a diagnosis be placed under strict surveillance and examination.
Chinese scientists estimate that the number of cases of insatiable disease varies from several to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; normally, it is five days; until it is fully clear from the symptom of the abdication: the initial estimate of the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptom was originally 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still unknown.
The disease is deemed mainly to be transmitted during close contact, as well as through small droplets emitted in air with cough, snorkeling or during conversation; close contact means contact in a radius of between 1 and 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some of the open cough studies, the drop may range from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
It is assumed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops emitted into the air during conversation that can remain in the air for longer periods of time, and respiratory drops may also be formed during the breath, including during a conversation, although the virus is usually not transported by air.
Paples can reach the mouth or nose of a number of people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as injection and cardio-drugal renegation (SDR), may lead to dilution and, consequently, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It may also enter the body if the person concerns a contaminated surface, including skin, followed by a touch to his eyes, nose or mouth.
There is also a fear that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Government of China denies the possibility of a fecal-organic transmission of SARS-Cov-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days of symptoms, although its spread may occur both before the symptoms and at the later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where the tests have been positive in testing three days before symptoms, indicating that the virus can be passed on to an express symptom.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of unspoiled disease, but surveillance studies in some countries have also revealed cases of transmission from unsymptimated carriers.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (EDC) claim that it is not yet fully clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient is usually infected by 2-3 other people; the virus is capable of surviving on surfaces of several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could live for up to three days on the plastic surface (polypy) and on stainless steel (304), on the paper surface for one day, and on copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, with a positive result of COVID-19 in households and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to people, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with the animals, just as after contact with other surfaces to which infected people could touch.
Heavy acute respiratory coroner syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus discovered for the first time by three people with pneumonia from a group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-Cov-2 virus occur in nature from the coronary coronas, and the human body is destroyed by a soap that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-COV-2 has a very similar character to the SAS-Cov reference virus.
He's supposed to be of a zoo-based origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it was genetically clustered with the genus Betaconavirus, the subgena of Sarabetovirus (B label) in conjunction with two other strains of bat viruses.
At a holistic level, 96 per cent is identified by other specimens of the coroner's muscle (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome of the messenger and human viruses.
A whole-human comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of the similarity (92 per cent) is between the coronaviral of the pangolin and the SARS-Cov-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate hosts of the virus.
The virus may be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it must be confirmed in the final analysis of the polymerous chain reaction with the opposite transcrystration (RT-PCR) of an infected secret or computer scan.
A study comparing the Uhan methods of PCR and the CTC showed that the CTC is much more sensitive than PCRs, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease currents.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnostics”.
WHO published several RNA test protocols to SARS-Cov-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is under way.
It may be performed on respiratory samples and blood samples.
The results are usually produced for periods ranging from several hours to several days.
The test is normally used to carry out spore oils, although it can also be used to use pots, and a number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them had been accurate enough to obtain broad-use approval.
In the United States, the Celex serological test was approved for use only by certified laboratories in emergency cases.
The characteristics of visualisation of X-ray and computer scans (CT) are asymmetric peripheral variation in the type of uterine glass and the absence of plemetres.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for the development of an international database of confirmed cases of infection.
Because of the connection with other infections such as the adnovirus, COVID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests have a limited clinical feature.
In China, a major study was carried out that compared the results of the chest TC with that of the PCR, and it was found that although images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be encrypted faster; they are also more sensitive and therefore can be considered a screening tool in infected areas.
In order to diagnosed the virus with X-rays and computer scans, direct neural networks were developed based on artificial intelligence.
Strategies to prevent disease transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touch to the eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using coughs or teas to be thrown out immediately after use.
Those who may have already contracted the disease should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that physical distance be provided from people; many Governments recommend refraining from any short-term travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus has been spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread among the population whose members do not know where and how it has been infected; it is recommended that standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with other people and eye protection, should be used by health-care providers to determine the source of the infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens by their mobile phones for this purpose raised concerns about confidentiality, and statements were made by organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as by over 100 other organizations that would need to limit this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use had been developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups had worked on developing solutions to ensure personal data confidentiality — for example, recording the proximity of users to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user was in close contact with the person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he would receive the notice. There are also baseless versions of how to prevent the infection - for example, slit the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working towards its establishment.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hand-pollution, before eating, after shrivelling, coughing or buming.
This is necessary because while outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the domestic soap that masks its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to handle hands on alcohol-based basis with a minimum of 60 per cent alcohol.
WHO recommends that people avoid having to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated by a number of solutions (a minute after application) with 62 to 71 per cent ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent isopropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen dioxide and 0.2 to 7.5.5 per cent water-id.
Other components, such as benzalconium and chlorhexide glucose, are less efficient.
CDC recommends that, if suspected of COVID or confirmed in an institution, such as office or daytime space, all such spaces, including rooms, toilets, general premises, electronics, such as tablets, sensory screens, keyboards, remote control remote controls and bankers used by sick people, be infected.
Medical organizations recommend that when coughing or tea is done, cover the mouth and nose of the elbow or salphet and immediately throw out the hygiene items used.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to use medical masks, as mask use can limit the amount and range of food distributions which are dispersed in the air during conversation, tea and cough.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “the use of medical masks may reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and exposure to the face by dirty hands is the main mode of infection.” Masks are also recommended for use by those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, for example, those who take care of a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of a mask actually reduces the number of contacts to a person.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks in public places.
The CDC centres, the U.S., recommend weed masks for non-medical use, and China specifically emphasized the importance of using one-time medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with other people.
It is recommended that Hong Kong wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Thailand's health officials are calling on people to make and erase face-to-face cloths in their home environment.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going outside without masks closing their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has committed all visitors to the food store to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where ten million masks per day are produced from mid-March, medical masks were ordered to be used for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents are obliged to wear a medical mask on the street; it was recommended that they wear it on their own in the home.
Medical masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an anti-infection measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures while staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding people, using endless greetings and physically moving away from others.
Many Governments in the regions, particularly those severely affected by the outbreak, now prescribe or recommend social distance.
The maximum number of people who can meet in one location, as recommended by the U.S. government and health organizations, has been reduced rapidly from 250 people (in regions where there was no data on the dissemination of COVID-19), to 50 people, to 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering of older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and weakened immune system, and faced a higher risk of infection in serious form. CDC recommends that they stay home as long as there is a outbreak of disease in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began replacing the term “social distance” with “physical distance” so as to specify the purpose of this measure by reducing physical contact within the framework of social relations, whether through virtual communication or through physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood in a way that people should be completely excluded from social exclusion rather than stay in contact with other people in alternative ways, and some agencies had published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
Among others, it was recommended that only permanent partners with whom you live be involved and in whom you are sure that he does not have the virus and his symptoms.
People with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected are recommended self-insegration in the home environment.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines on appropriate self-insegration, and many Governments have also introduced mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas self-incarnation.
People in high-risk groups had been ordered to have a hottest quarantine.
Persons who may have been in contact with an infected COVID-19, or have recently visited a country or region significantly affected by the epidemic, were recommended quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat outbreaks include controlling, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease is carried out in the early stages and is intended to track and isolate the infected, as well as other infectious control and vaccination measures, with a view to halting the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are directed towards mitigation: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Control and mitigation measures may be taken simultaneously.
The spread of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below 1. Part of the control effort is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the leveling of the epidemic.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to deal with outbreaks include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-insulgence; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as closing schools and the removal of mass events; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and environmental protection, such as surface cleaning; and once the seriousness of the flash was apparent in China, more decisive action was taken to contain the outbreaks, such as the isolation of whole cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries have also adopted a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced, and a system of alerts for the displacement of infected persons was set up.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected individuals who were self-insured and imposed heavy penalties on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks increased and fined excess medical supplies, and British and U.S. modelling showed that there are serious problems with the mitigation (slow, but not the spread of the epidemic).
A best policy for alleviating the effects of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3, while mortality can double, but can lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapses of health systems.
Pressure may be the preferred method, but it should be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until a vaccine is developed if it is sooner), since otherwise the spread of the disease will be rapidly resumed when the measures are weakened.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have resulted in social and economic costs.
There are no anti-retroviral drugs approved for COVID-19 treatment at present, but efforts are under way to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Accepting unreceptive medicines from colds, drinking sufficient fluids, and relaxing can help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous introduction of fluid, and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only be harmful.
Several compounds previously approved for other viral diseases are also considered for use for COVID-19 treatment.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic” tools could facilitate the symptoms caused by SARS-Cov-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and adaptation of health to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a key response to the outbreak of the disease.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (EDRC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to assist in the redeployment of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the elimination of non-recurrent procedures where possible, the detection of the virus and the isolation of patients with confirmed diagnosis COVID-19, as well as the expansion of intensive therapy by training staff and increasing the number of available LILs and beds.
There are different theories as to where the first case of infection might arise, the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of infection with the new coronaviral infection probably occurred on 1 December 2019 in Huhaang Province, China.
Over the course of the month, the number of coronavirus infections in the province of Hubei has gradually increased.
They were mainly linked to the wholesale market of Huangans seafood, which also sold live animals, and one theory was that the virus had spread into the body of one of these animals; in other words, the virus had a zoo-based origin. On 26 December, a mass pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in a clinic in Hubey province with a doctor named Zhang Tianji, who reported on 27 December to the Centre for Monitoring and Prevention of Jiangang's Disease in the town of Huhan.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at the central clinic of the town of Huhan warned their colleagues about a “Koraviar similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlian, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Fen, received a speech from his superiors for having raised a panic.
Later on, on 31 December, the Uhanya Municipal Health Commission issued a public notification and informed WHO of the situation.
Uhana health authorities reported the number of undisclosed pneumonia cases, which proved to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of incidents doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year's holidays and the fact that Uhan is a transport and main railway unit.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to the more recent official data, by 20 January 2020, symptoms had already appeared in 6,174 persons. As at 26 March, the United States had denied China and Italy the largest number of confirmed cases of infection worldwide. As at 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories reported at least one reported case of contamination.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries of the Shengen Zone have restricted their free movement and have established border controls.
National responses included measures to control the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory stay, compulsory shelter or isolation), as well as curfews. As at 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population of the United States, were in any form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are isolated in the Philippines, some 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were isolated in some form, and two days later that figure rose to 2.6 billion — about one third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Uhana on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the reliability of which was not verified, the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jianxian worked for an unknown type of mass pneumonia disease, which was notified on 27 December by the Centre for Monitoring and Prevention of Jiangyan Diseases in the town of Huhan.
Initial genetic testing of samples of patients on 27 December 2019 showed the existence of SARS-like coronary.
On 31 December, Uhanya Municipal Health Commission issued a public notification.
WHO was notified the same day.
In connection with such notices, the police warned the Uhan doctors about responsibility for the “disarmament of rumours” of outbreak.
Initially, the National Health Commission of China claimed that there was no “extreme evidence” of the ability of the newly detected virus to be transmitted from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, later called the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Ci Jinpin, the “national war”.
The “most large-scale quarantine in the history of mankind” has been unfolded, and on 23 January the border on sanitation and the ban on entry to and from Uhan was declared, and the measure later extended to a total of 15 towns in Hubei province to a total of about 57 million people.
The use of personal transportation was prohibited in the city.
In many places, the celebration of the Chinese New Year (25 January) was cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Huoshenhani, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Laishhan, was built to receive other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also rededicated 14 other institutions in Uhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including the issuance of health reports for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year.
Universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced remote working regimes.
Travel restrictions were introduced in the Hubei province and beyond.
The timetable for public transport has been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
The civilian movement control regime has been introduced in many cities, and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) have experienced some form of open-air restrictions. After the outbreak of the global phase in March, China's authorities have taken strict measures to prevent imports of the virus from other countries.
In Beijing, for example, a mandatory 14-day quarantine was introduced for all international travelers entering the city; as at 23 March, only one case of internal transmission was registered in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, China's Prime Minister Lee Keazan reported that the spread of intracountry cases had largely been stopped and the outbreak in China had been controlled.
On the same day, the restrictions on travel to Hubey other than Uhanai were lifted, two months after the closure of the province on quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons holding visas or residence permits would be suspended as of 28 March, and that the exact deadline for lifting the order had not been called.
Those wishing to come to China would be required to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called upon enterprises and factories to resume their operations and provided companies with a package of monetary incentives. On 4 April, a national three-minute silence was held, which opened a mourning day on the victims of the coroner, announced by the National Council of the Nation, in conjunction with the Queen ' s Day, but citizens were asked by the Central Government to pay tribute to those who had lost their lives online, in keeping with physical distance, to avoid a resurgence of COVII-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had been extended to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely because of the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchongji in Tegu.
Shinchongji’s followers arrived at Teugu from Uhan, allegedly a source of flash.
As at 22 February, of the 9,336 church followers 1,261 (approximately 13%), they had symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea had the highest level of anxiety.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were reported in Korea, and on 29 February the rate had risen to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were put on quarantine after three soldiers ' analyses confirmed the existence of the virus.
The outbreaks had an impact on travel, and the airline schedule had been changed, and South Korea had launched a screening programme for the virus, the tracking of contacts and the organization of quarantine measures for contacts, which was considered to be the largest and best in terms of organization around the world.
The screening methods included mandatory information on its symptoms through a mobile app to all visitors from abroad, frontal testing for the virus, which was ready for the next day, and improved testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean programme was considered successful in the fight against the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that cities had not begun to be isolated there; initially, South Korean society had been divided by the response of President Mun Jae Inh to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment to be inadequate, in their view, the Government's response to the outbreak of disease.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest rate of infection per day within four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April all newly arrived from abroad would be placed on two weeks ' quarantine.

On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed infections of SARS-Cov-2 in Kume, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Health Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, as well as the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to subject whole areas affected by the outbreak to quarantine, but only individuals would be placed on quarantine.
Plans were announced in March to limit inter-city travel, but intensive urban movement continued to take place before the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrines in Kume remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, and Iran became the focal point for the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the background of allegations of the collapse in Iran, by 28 February more than 10 countries had reported cases of disease to Iran, indicating that the extent of the outbreak there could be more serious than the 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members were reported to have positive results on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent and to release temporarily all prisoners fit for this category.
The organization claims that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons where adequate medical care is lacking.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronavirus were reported each hour in Iran, and every ten minutes, one death from the coronavirus.
According to the representative of WHO, the incidence in Iran could be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that U.S. sanctions against Iran could affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had called for mitigation of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had hit Italy when two Chinese tourists had the SARS-Cov-2 tests in Rome and had been successful.
The number of cases of infection has increased rapidly, causing the Italian Government to suspend all flights to China and China and to declare a state of emergency.
Later, an informal cluster of COVID-19 infections was discovered. It began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombard on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 persons from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed on quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conté said: “Entering and leaving the disease zone will be closed.
In these areas, enterprises have already been ordered to be suspended and sporting events cancelled.” On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as at that time 100 people had already been killed in Italy.
All major sporting events, including A football matches, were to be held in private until April, but on 9 March all sports events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of enterprises except supermarkets and pharmacists. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resumptions and Intensive Medicine (SIARTI) issued recommendations on medical ethics for priority protocols for patients who may need to engage.
On 19 March, Italy adopted China ' s death rate as the world ' s first largest cause, after a declaration of 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it became known that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronaviral infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardria region.
A CNN report notes that such a high mortality rate in Italy can contribute to a combination of two factors — the large number of older citizens in that country and the lack of capacity to examine all those who are now crowned with coronavirus.
The United Kingdom had responded to the virus by the most peaceful of all the affected countries, and by 18 March 2020 the British Government had not obliged citizens to comply with any form of social distance or quarantine.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not being quick and serious enough to respond to the danger posed by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending refraining from all travel and social contacts that were of paramount importance, inviting people to work from their homes as soon as possible and avoiding public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment institutions, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than 2,500 pounds per month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent measures for social exclusion, prohibiting the gathering of more than two persons and limiting travel and active rest in the fresh air only in cases of extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions have been imposed on the police, fines and the prosecution of human beings.
Most enterprises have been ordered to close, with the exception of enterprises that provide “life-related services”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business shops, auto-fuelling stations and garages.

Despite this, the testing of the population in the United States did not start immediately, and the true extent of the outbreak of the disease was hidden during that period.
The test was difficult due to the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence by the end of February of the federal Government ' s permission to use non-State test kits developed by academic organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria prior to March to allow citizens to undergo testing (this could be done only upon appointment to a medical doctor).
The Washington Post reported that by 27 February, less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been conducted by 13 March.

In general, the views of President Trump ' s supporters on how successful he was in dealing with the crisis were divided.
Some officials and observers criticized US dependence on imports of essential materials, including essential items, from China.
In mid - January 2020, Travel Mediaine published an analysis of air travel schemes that were used to map and forecast the spread of the disease.
The International Air Transport Association reported in 2018 that Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had received the largest number of travelers from Uhanja.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne were also regarded as popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali was identified as the least ready for an outbreak, while Australian cities are considered to be the most developed. On 7 February, Australia adopted its emergency plan for the new coronary (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is stated that much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will pay particular attention to border controls and communications in a threat situation.
On 21 March, Australia declared an emergency in the area of human biosecurity.

On the other hand, Chinese assistance was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency relief operations to developing countries.
WHO commended the Chinese authorities for their efforts to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.
WHO noted the obvious differences between the outbreak of apparent pneumonia that occurred between 2002 and 2004, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of concealing information, which allegedly prevented the prevention and control of the spread of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis in which the central Government “regularly updated information on the situation to avoid panic on the eve of the New Year of China”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a ban on movement in Uhan, the representative of WHO, Goden Galea, noted that, while “this measure was not recommended by WHO”, it was also “an important indication of the fulfilment of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the most proliferation site”, and called it “unforeseen in the history of public health”. On 30 January, after confirmation of the ability to transmit infection from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of cases occurring in other countries, WHO declared the emergency situation in the public health system of international importance (PGEIC); this was the sixth since 2009, when such a measure was first applied during the pig influenza pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adana, said that the PHAIC announcement was due to “a global market, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movements and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested $675 million from the world community to provide strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need to provide urgent assistance to countries that “are not equipped with systems to detect people infected with the virus despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the level of preparedness for our weakest function” and called on the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay for the future” at a press conference held on 11 February, WHO officially named COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide “a system-wide response to the problem”.
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group has been established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO states, will “focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to deal with the outbreak of the disease more socially and economically”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc team that ensured the work of international experts and WHO staff on the ground in China to help resolve the situation within the country and assess the “seriousness of the disease and its infection”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of the response at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavius pandemic, noting that “until it is too early to call the pandemic, countries should nevertheless be prepared”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of global coroner dissemination would be raised “high” to “highest” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergency programme, warned in his statement: “This is a verification of every government on the planet for a real world: the time to act.
This virus may already be on the road to your country, and you need to be ready,” and emphasized that the right response can help the world avoid “the worst scenario of events”.
Ryan also said that current data did not provide a basis for a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that a pandemic announcement would mean that “we do indeed recognize that everyone on the planet would be at risk of contracting the virus”.
On 11 March, WHO announced the outbreak of the coroner’s pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO “is deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high rate of disease and its alarming level of inaction in this regard.” WHO is seriously criticized for its perceived inadequate approach to the pandemic, including later public health emergency announcement and pandemic classification.
As a response to the current situation, Mr. Tedos Adanama, Director-General of WHO, was asked to resign, which was signed by 733,000 as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized the importance of respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to take life-saving measures against him and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be an excuse for discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts emphasized that everyone had the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, refugees and other unclear groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses throughout the world, as well as to provide views and recommendations.
The digital knot contains information on the policy measures of different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the world economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coroner.
The Government of China was criticized by the United States, the Minister of the British Cabinet, Michael Gouwa, and Eduardo Bolsonro, the son of the President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonro, for taking action against the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of Chinese Communist Party leaders (CPCs) were dismissed at the provincial level for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these dismissals were a sign of dissatisfaction with the political actions of the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Jinpin, from public wrath over the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the coronavirus had started at Uhan but had taken sides with the theory of conspiracy that COVID-19 had occurred in the United States or Italy.
President Donald Trump's administration called the coronary virus “Chinese virus” or “Uhan's virus”, stating that “the Chinese license only exacerbates the situation with the virus, which has now become a global pandemic”, and this was in turn criticized by some commentators who claim to be racist and “distracted from the inability of the US President's administration to contain the spread of disease”.
The Daily Beast received access to the U.S. government cable, which contains a communications strategy strategy designed by the National Security Council, with such references to the strategy: “The whole business in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television broadcasts.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Blogomberg stated that China's efforts to assist countries affected by the virus were part of a “provoke” to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitic component that includes fighting for influence through the piaar and so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is insisting on its role as a responsible and reliable partner, as opposed to the United States”.
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some indications that it had sent assistance to the last two countries.
Jack Ma 100,000 medical masks to Cuba were sacrificed because of the United States sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of driving aid from other countries into their own country.
Medical masks have also arisen in disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy.
Turkey has also assigned hundreds of IWL machines to Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronary of Italy.
Mauricio Massari, Italian Ambassador to the EU, said that “China alone responded bilaterally.
This clearly does not indicate the European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone call with the Prime Minister of Italy, Giuseppe Konte, President Vladimir Putin of Russia organized a shipment of Russian military ambulances, specialized decontamination transport and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source” as saying that 80 per cent of Russian assistance was “useless or of little benefit to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of attempting to make a favourable impression on the world public at the “geopolitic and diplomatic level”.
President Lombardia Attilio Fontana and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi De Mayo, rejected the attacks by the media and expressed their appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a medically assisted cargo plane to the United States.
The Spock's Spock Spokes Secretary-General stated that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American producers of medical equipment and materials are growing in production, they will also be able to respond when necessary”.
NATO Defense 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the cold war — will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the teachings of Defender 2020 (Protection 2020) as follows: “In the public health crisis today, these exercises endanger the lives of not only the military US and many European participating countries, but also residents of the countries in which such activities are to be carried out.” The Iranian Government has suffered greatly from the virus, with about two dozen members of Parliament, as well as fifteen other current or former political figures in the country.
On 14 March 2020, President Hassan Ruhani of Iran made an open letter to the world leaders, saying that his country was having difficulty combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets owing to sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran, and that the epidemic had given rise to appeals to the United States for the adoption of social policies that were prevalent in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a common system of health care and child care, paid family leave and increased funding for public health.
Politicians expected that this could have a negative impact on the chances of Donald Trump for re-election in the 2020 presidential election, and the pandemic had worsened diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticized Japan's “unequal and passive quarantine” following Japan's announcement that any South Korean national will be placed on a two-week quarantine in places specially designated by the Government.
South Korean society was originally divided by President Mun Zhe-in ' s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment to be inadequate, in their view, the Government's response to the outbreak of the disease; the pandemic forced countries to enact emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators express concern that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orbán the power to administer the decrees indefinitely, suspend Parliament, and hold elections and punish those who will be accused of disseminating fairy tale information about the virus and government response to the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been cited as a cause of supply deficits due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the acquisition of goods in panic and the disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Authority issued warnings on the shortage of medicines and medical equipment, resulting from increased consumer demand and vendor disruptions.
In several towns, there were also Panamanian purchases; this led to the loss of basic necessities from the shops, such as food, toilet paper and bulk water, which in turn led to a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warned of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Teddy Adanma, the demand for personal protection has increased 100 times.
This leap has resulted in a 20fold increase in prices compared with the normal price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies by four to six months.
It had also caused a global shortage of individual protection, and WHO had warned that health workers would be affected for that reason.
In Australia, because of the pandemic, daiga buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian products to China.
This has led to a lack of nutrition in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government, despite the high incidence of COVID-19 cases in North Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for food, there has been a decline in food shortages in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illicit trade in critical products that have been successful have avoided the acute food shortage that was expected in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with small agricultural production, had not experienced a significant decline, but industry believed that agricultural prices could rise.
The food shops remained empty only temporarily, even in the town of Uhan, while Chinese government officials ensured access to the stocks of pigs to ensure full nutrition for the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to preserve food stocks in case of emergency also existed in Italy.
The damage caused by the world economy had affected China: according to the media of 16 March, China ' s economy had suffered much in the first two months of 2020 as a result of government measures to combat the spread of the virus, which had reduced retail sales by 20.5 per cent.
The mother China is a major economic and production centre; therefore, the viral outbreak is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agate Demariy, an economic expert in the United States, predicts that market volatility will continue until there is a clearer understanding of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts calculated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could surpass the impact of the abysmal pneumonia from 2002 to 2004.
According to one of the assessments made by an expert from the University of Washington, St. Louis, the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and negative effects could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has taken “immediate measures” following a sharp decline in oil prices due to a decline in China's demand.
On 24 February, world stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected by COVII-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, owing to growing concerns about the outbreak of coroneria, various United States stock indices, including NASAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dou-Johns index, have shown the most dramatic fall since 2008, with the drop in Doo index of 1,911 — the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis in 2007-2008.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed a fall of more than 10 per cent.
On 28 February, Scope Trainings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The attacks fell again because of concerns over the spread of the coroner and the fall of the largest occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a possibility of economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with restrictions on movement, closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and recommendations by Governments not to travel at all.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines cancelled flights because of the sharp decline in the demand for airfares, including British Airways, China East Airlines and Qantas, and the British Regional Air Force Flybe ceased to exist.
The effects on the cruise industry have been stronger than ever before.
Several railway stations and ferry transport ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with June, the main tourist season of China's New Year's season.
A number of activities involving a large number of people have been cancelled by national and regional Governments, including annual New Year's Festivals; private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Diceland.
Many recent events had been cancelled, and tourist attractions had been closed to prevent mass accumulations of people; for example, the Ban City had been closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs had been abolished.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and districts of China, the authorities extended the New Year's Day until 10 February, instructing most enterprises not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of the exports.
The Hong Kong authorities raised the response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared the emergency by closing schools until March and by canceling the New Year's celebration, and the retail sector suffered from a global impact: the shop hours were reduced and some shops were temporarily closed.
Visiting retail points in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retail industries in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March the attendance of shopping malls fell between 33 and 43 per cent, compared with February.
Trade Point operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, the installation of visitors ' temperature checks and the cancellation of events, and estimates that the crisis in Latin America caused by the pandemic can leave 14-22 million more people behind the line of poverty than it would have been in a similar situation but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Uhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the 300 million Chinese migrant rural workers were at home in their own provinces or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought the assistance of the Government.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the outbreak of coronavirus could deprive 47 million people of their jobs, and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, leaving tens of millions of Indian migrant workers receiving daily wages unemployed in India and showing that 44 per cent of Canadian households faced unemployment in one way or another. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers had also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment benefit, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit. Almost half a million companies in Germany had moved their employees to a government-subsidized reduced work schedule, part-time.
The German part-time wage scheme was also introduced in France and Britain.
Art and cultural heritage have also suffered greatly from the pandemic, which has affected organizations and individuals, whether officially employed or independent, worldwide.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often State-funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society by ensuring the safety of their staff and the public and, to the extent possible, by supporting the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions have been closed for indefinite periods throughout the world, or access has been limited to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and presentations have been cancelled or postponed to other dates.
An intensive effort has been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms; yet another recent and current development is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as musical festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashions.
The Vatican has also announced the abolition of events in Rome during the last week of the Christian repentant period — the Great Post.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services began to broadcast on radio, live or on television, while some church leaders offer public - air services.
The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome has closed down to attend its churches, the chapels and the square of St. Peter, where Christian pilgrims are no longer present, and later other religious organizations have also abolished worship and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdes.
The Iranian Ministry of Health had announced the abolition of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia had prohibited the access of foreign pilgrims and its own residents to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant change in the calendar of world sporting events since the Second World War.
Most of the major sporting events have been cancelled or carried over, including the UFA Champions League 2019-20, the Prime League 2019-200, the Euro2020 UFA, the NBA season 2019-20 and the NCL season 2019-20.
The coronavirus also destroyed the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were scheduled to start at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transmitted beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021” and Kazino and other gambling institutions around the world were closed and poker tournaments, which were usually broadcast live, were either carried over or cancelled.
This has resulted in many players moving online and many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, as the entertainment industry has also been affected, as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have also cancelled all their productions.
As an alternative to traditional off-line activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results via the Internet, providing direct webcasts or web-based festivals, helping people to continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
The network has produced many Internet memorials on the subject of coroneria, many of which are humorous and have smoothed the disturbing moods of periods of uncertainty.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as from people of hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Cases of fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
The February reports (where most of the cases of infection were still limited to China) included racist attitudes expressed by various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received just retribution for anything.
In some countries of Africa, there is also an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Huhana and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Both online and online support was provided to Chinese citizens, as well as to those living in areas affected by the virus.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first in Europe to face a serious COVID 19 outbreak; therefore, citizens of such regions may also begin to feel the impact of suspicion and xenophobia; nationals of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed a petition early in their country, insisting that Chinese citizens should not enter their country to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, hashtag # ChineseDontCommetoJapan (Chickenback Japan) held leadership positions in Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians residing in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report a growing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for what he called the coronavir a “Chinese virus”, which critics believe is racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protests attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Uhana to New Sanjara.
Students coming from the north-eastern Indian border of China and studying in major Indian cities reported persecutions related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the President of the State Section of Bharatiya Janata party, West Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “God had therefore avenged them”.
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, who called them “the hibernation”, in China, once again the pandemic caused xenophobia and racism against non-Chinans: foreigners came to be called “a foreign garbage” and facilities to be “cultivated”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many researchers have made open access to their scientific articles on the coroner’s outbreak.
Some scholars have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their research on pre-prints, such asbioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of the respiratory coroner 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-Cov-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and the methods of detection of antitels being developed in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the OE-PCR, which shall recognize the RNA of the coroner.
This test is specific and is only intended to detect the SARS-Cov-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
Antitel detection (serology) may be used for both diagnostics and popular control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people suffering from a disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to treat in a hospital or who did not.
The exact mortality rate from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests carried out in different countries was very controversial.
These differences are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly exaggerated.
Using a polymera chain reaction, real-time reverse transmission (RRT-PCR) of the test may be carried out on samples from the respiratory pathways obtained by various means, including a nasal oil or a wet sample.
The results are usually available for a period of between a few hours and two days.
From the PCR test, which was performed on strokes taken from the throat, was only valid during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, but it can continue to multiply in the lungs.
The infected patients tested in the second week of the disease may alternatively take the material from the lower respiratory pathways by means of a sucking catheter or use the products (mocrote).
One of the early PCR tests was developed at Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a polymera chain reaction with a reverse real-time transmission (RRT-PCR) and was the basis for 250,000 sets which were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its own test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed the SARS-COV-2 detection kit based on the clinical level PCR (PaerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the gene "E", common to all of China's beta plants, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-Cov-2. China's BGI Group became one of the first companies to have approved China's National Drug Administration for the urgent use of the SARS-Cov-2 detection toolbox based on PRC. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributed through the International Reagent Resource to run RTC-PCD in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-NOV) Real-Time RT-PCR Digital Panel in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests in the older versions of test kits produced incomplete results due to the marriage of reagents and a small area of testing conducted by CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples a day were processed on average throughout February 2020.
The tests using the two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were the public and local laboratories permitted to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Medicine Supervisory Office as part of an emergency use permit. The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that it was possible to test COVID-19 based on PCR-CPD throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics started a COVID-19 test across the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were stated; the collection and processing of analyses should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Research Centre for virology and biotechnology, WECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervisory Service, and it was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo clinic developed a COVID-19 infection test. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by FDA for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours for a large number of tests, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency authorization (EUA) to Abottt laboratories to test the Abbott M2000 system; previously FDA had issued such permission to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives the EU from FDA for about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test in place of the PCR using an isominated Nucleic acid amplification technology.
Since this test does not require a series of spinal temperatures, the method can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are about 18,000 of these vehicles in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase the production of up to 50,000 tests per day, and Taiwan is currently developing a monopolic antibodies test, which is specifically linked to the new coroner ' s N-white protein (N-white) and is looking forward to receiving results in 15 to 20 minutes like a influenza express test.
A survey of specialized literature in March 2020 concluded that “reentgenograms of the chest have a small diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of the CT [computer scan] may be of such value even before symptoms occur”.
Typical features identified during the TC include two-way multi-dimensional sub-gravity focusses for a type of “mass glazing” with a peripheral, asymmetrical and asterioric distributions.
Sub-divisional dominance, bulk bridge symptom and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
A study comparing Uhan ' s methods with those used at the time of the current pandemic found that the CTC was more sensitive than PCRs, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincided with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19” as of March 2020 for initial CDC screening.
The partial immune response to the infection is expressed in the development of antitels, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to conduct popular control, and analyses can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or through local diagnosis (POCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-quality automated systems, but their accessibility will depend on the production speed of each system.
A sample of off-site blood is commonly used in CLT, although serial samples may be used to track the immune response.
At PCT one blood sample is usually produced by the permeation of each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need for a sampling phase. On March 26, 2020, FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to pass their tests on antibodies.
As of 7 April 2020, FDA approved only one emergency resolution test. At the end of March 2020, European Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epipipipe Diagnostics had European permits to use their test kits, which could detect IgG and IgA blood samples capable of fighting the virus.
The test output is several hundred samples over several hours, and therefore the method works much faster than the usual PCR-analysis of the virus RNA.
The antibody is usually detected 14 days after infection, and in early April Britain discovered that none of its antibody tests kits acquired was satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme was developed to allow patients to remain at home suspected of being infected with the virus: “the emergency room is passed on to the patient for the sample”, the patient spits back, gives back the results after a while, and the British NHS announced that it would launch its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases in the home, which eliminates the risk of infection by the patient of other hospital visitors, or that it is necessary to disinfect the ambulance if it was used for the patient's transport, and during an air test on COVID-19 in suspicious cases, a medical officer takes all appropriate precautions.
Express test centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than in any other country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Medical Doctors stated that it was prepared to conduct about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient conditions, and the week earlier they were able to do only 10,000 tests a week.
If the examination is ordered by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to the President of the Robert Koha Institute, the total performance of Germany in testing is 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, a number of major cities had been requested to conduct air-testing.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests passed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study found that, as of the calendar week, 12/200, at SATS-Cov-2, a total of at least 483,295 tests, up to the week 12/200, inclusive, and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent), the result was positive. The researchers of the Israeli Technion and Ramam Hospital clinics developed and tested a method of testing simultaneously the samples taken from 64 patients, combining the samples and carrying out further analyses only if the combined sample shows a positive result. On 5 February 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory of 2,000 square metres square metres to detect emergency cases called Kho-Yang (Chini-Yangi) or “Oggle” which could process more than 10,000 samples a day.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Jiang in just five days, and modelling showed that if the laboratory had not been put into service at such an accelerated pace, the cases in Huba would have been 47 per cent higher and thus the costs of quarantine would have been twice higher.
The opening of the Uhan laboratory was immediately opened by the Huo-Yanghang laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, to a total of 12 Chinese cities.
By 4 March 2020, the daily totals of the tests were 50,000 per day; open multi-lexed Origami Assays schemes had been launched, which could test up to 1,12 patients ' analyses for COVID19 using only 93 samples; these balanced structures could work in small laboratories, excluding the need to use robotic liquids.
In March, due to insufficient and insufficient reagents, the problem of mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States has become a challenge.
As a result, some authors have applied to test-testing protocols, which provide that samples are heated at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the coronavor test currently carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita exceeded any other country ' s figures, and a majority of the population will soon be tested.
This was due to the possibility of rapid testing, along with the acquisition of mass testing laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yun emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, launched in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of tests per day, and is the world ' s first laboratory of so large a scale that works outside of China.
Various test options for different parts of the genetic profile of the coroner were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of test kits that go to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States health and epidemiological centres was inaccessible until 28 January, leading to the absence of testing kits in the United States. At the beginning of the outbreak in China and the United States there were problems with the reliability of the test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient numbers of kits recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts claim that the wide availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the new coroner.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working to provide test opportunities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the strengthening of testing programmes as a best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many U.S. private laboratories, which had received hundreds of thousands of samples, were overloaded and stocks of material for brush and chemical reagents were rapidly exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The U.S. test kits developed by CDC had “necessaries” and for that reason the Government had removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private development of the tests, and Spain had acquired tests from a Chinese firm, Shenzhen Bioesy Biotechlogy Co Ltd, but found that the results of the tests were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the inaccuracies of the results might be the failure to take samples or the improper use of sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw and replace them with other sets of Shenzen Bioesy. 80 per cent of the tests that Czecha obtained in China had failed to produce. 1.2 million test kits obtained by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed to drop them into Danube, Atesh Kara, a Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits acquired in China had “a high level of error” and that the Ministry had “no use of them”. Britain had purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but that in early April 2020 they were not suitable for use.
Quarantine measures for those whose analyses had had a positive effect on SARS-Cov-2, as well as monitoring of the people with whom the patients had been contacted, had had a positive effect.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Voo, where the first man died in Italy from COVID-19, conducted two testing cycles for the entire population of about 3,400 people, with a intervals of about ten days.
About half of the positive people had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were put on quarantine.
The entry into the community area was closed and the measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
With the intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, the coroner's pandemic of 2020 was much less intense in Singapore than in other developed countries, and there were no such extreme restrictions as the forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were cancelled and Singapore began to urge residents to stay at home on 28 March, but Sunday schools were opened on schedule on 23 March.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive surveillance, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but have been less aggressive.
A statistical study found that in countries where more tests were carried out than in the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because those countries were able to identify more patients with weak symptoms or the absence of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVII-19, send their first five positive and first 10 negative results of COVID-19 analyses to one of the 16 WHO testing laboratories for validation.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The following graph depends on the country-specific testing policy for the positive results column.
The country where only the hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher rate of positive performance than the country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of the symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Washing hands, also known as “hygiene hands”, is a process of cleaning hands to remove pollution, fat, micro-organisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands and soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted in the ernal way.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common cold, for example, when touching his eyes, nose or mouth (e.g. g. g. g. with his or her mucus) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, after which hands and soap should be washed: before and after defecation, after refilling the child ' s berries or diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and domestic fowl.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with the help of the wildebeest, and the World Health Organization recommends washing the hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the procedures for the care of the sick person.
After the change of diapers or the dressing of a child going to the toilet.
After shrivelling, coughing or snoring.
After touching animals, feed or wastes of animal origin.
Hand health is related to hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking drugs or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The primary purpose of hand washing is to clean up the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other germs that may cause disease), as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who prepare food or work in the medical sector, but it is also important for all others.
Hands are very useful for health: for example, they minimize the spread of influenza, coroneruses and other infectious diseases, prevent infectious diseases, reduce respiratory infections,
and also lowers the infant mortality rate in households.
The 2013 study showed that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by taking simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of hand washing can reduce diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water to low-income regions.
A 48 per cent reduction in the number of diarrhea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap, and hand washing with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (PRDs) if appropriate habits are developed in every home, in schools and in other public places around the world.
It is one of the main complications of the ORA, one of which is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Almost 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before eating and after toilets can save more lives than any one single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhea mortality by almost half, while the mortality from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hands are usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out in water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also prevents the impetego, a disease that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying and, as a result, damage to the skin.
The Danish study of 2012 showed that too often hand washing can lead to mucus and skin brushing — a disease known as eczema or hand hydmatism, which is particularly common to health workers.
Too often hand washing can also be considered a symptom of sensibilative disorder (CRD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission: after defecation (pulmonation, defecation), after refilling the child's berries (pocket change), before feeding the child, before receiving food and before/and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or fowl.
Some other cases in which hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of a cut or wound, after tea, cough or shrivell, after touching waste of animal origin or animal, after touching the garbage.
The process of washing hands with soap is quite common in many countries.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7 per cent of families washing hands with soap were common practice; 2014 studies showed that the highest rate, 97 per cent, was in Saudi Arabia; the United States, in that list, was closer to the mid-point; 77 per cent, the lowest figure was recorded in China, 23 per cent; there are now several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing a habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations; and in developing countries, group arm washing of schoolchildren at a given time is one such methodology that helps to instill children into such a procedure.
The “medical emergency programme”, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale interventions to promote child health and education.
This national programme is based on de-helming, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily cleaning of teeth with fluorine.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if soap or cleaning materials are added during washing.
The main activity of soap and cleaning is to remove barriers to solubleness and increase its level.
Water in itself is not considered to be an effective means of cleaning the skin, since fats and proteins that form components of organic pollution are poorly dissolved in water.
A sufficient quantity of water, however, contributes to the clean-up process.
Solid soap, because of multiple applications, may also contain bacteria which may be used for previous use.
A small number of studies on passing on every cover of bacteria from a solid - mile contaminated piece indicate that the presence is unlikely to occur, as bacteria are washed away from the foam.
CDC is still claiming that “liquid soap with hand-patch is the preferred option for hand washing”.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in health-care communities.
There is no evidence to date that the use of recommended antiseptic or decontamination funds has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
Antibacterial soap, however, contains common antibacterial agents, such as tricycles, which are resistant to a host of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic strains are not selective in relation to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be consistent with those declared.
In addition to surface-active acids and products for the protection of skin, complex compounds may contain acids (oxidus, assaturous, breast) as a control of pH, as well as anti-micro-active active benzy acid and other breaths (aleme vetamine, vitamins, rotol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon showed that in preventing disease and disinfecting bacteria from the hands, simple uses of soap are as effective as normal antibacterial soap containing tricloxone.
Hot water, comfortable for human skin, is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37 °C.
However, in order to remove natural fats containing pollution and bacteria, warm soap water is more effective than cold water.
Despite popular belief, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on hands.
The disinfecting hand (sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a hand - hygiene tool that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st centuries, alcohol - based hand hygiene funds (also known as alcohol - decontamination, antiseptic means of hand deinfection or sanitizers) were gaining popularity.
Most of these products are made on the basis of isoptropy alcohol or ethanol with the addition of substitutes, such as carbonmer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or wetizers, such as glycrine in liquid or drunk form, ensuring the convenience of the use of these means and reducing the effects of drying with alcohol.
The addition of a diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases the anti-microbiotic activity, and disinfectants containing a minimum of 60 to 95 per cent alcohol are effectively destroying microbes.
Inflammatory decontaminations kill bacteria, including bacteria with multiple drug stability (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis stick, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rinyrus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungus.
Decontaminations containing 70 per cent alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of the bacteria (logarial reductions of 3.5 are similar to those of 35 decibels) in their hands 30 seconds after use, and 99.99 per cent of the bacteria (logaris of 4 to 5 reductions) are in hands 1 minute after use.
The alcohol-contaminated decontaminations are almost ineffective against the noroposic virus (or Norwalk) type, the most common cause of the infectious gastrogenerite, and a sufficient quantity of antiseptic or alcohol-supporting equipment must be used to process and poll the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and rear surface of both spouses, as well as the space between fingers and the entire length of the fingers, grow for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or helium is completely absorbed.
The fingers on both hands should also be thoroughly washed, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated, the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases recommends that hand washing be chosen.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfectants is due to their simplicity of use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they must not be a substitute for the full washing of hands if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of disinfectants for the hands on alcohol-based basis may cause dry skins if they do not contain mitigating means and/or skin-wetting.
The effect of drying the skin by alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other mitigating substances to the means.
When clinical tests were carried out, disinfectants for the hands on an alcohol basis containing mitigating components caused much less skin irradiation and dryness than soap or anti-mixture detergents.
Allergic contact ermatites, contact-bed syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or supplements present in disinfectants are practically non-existent.
The lower probability of an irritated contact dystimite was a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free tools do not decontaminate their hands from organic substances but simply decontaminate them.
It is for this reason that disinfectants for the hands are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens, such as conventional soap and water, since, with such means, pathogens are still at their disposal.
The effectiveness of decontamination for alcohol-free hands is largely dependent on components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-producing drugs.
More recently, it has been demonstrated that the drugs used in chloride benzalconium have a persistent and cumulative anti-mikr activity, as opposed to alcohol, which has been proven to be ineffective after multiple use, probably due to progressive side effects of each reaction.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford and replace soap or clay.
Gold or clay may be more efficient than just water, but it will always be less efficient than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or salt are contaminated with micro-organisms, it may, on the other hand, increase the spread of the disease.
The salt, like soap, is a decontamination tool because it forms a solution when it is in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO, as an alternative, recommends the use of gold or sand.
In order to prevent infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend hand washing, which includes the following steps:
Put your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that wet water be used because the drinking water can be contaminated and the temperature of the water is not.
Wash your hands with a lot of soap, including the back of your palm, as well as an area between your fingers and under your fingernails.
The soap removes the microbe from the skin, and research shows that when soap (not just one water) is used, people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Three hands at least 20 seconds.
Tension helps to remove germs from your skin, and the longer you use your hands, the more germs are removed.
Carefully wet your hands under the running water.
Warming the hands in standing water can cause reabsorption.
Win your hands clean with your towel, or let them dry on your own.
Most people are left out of areas such as thumb, wrist, toe and toe.
Artificial fingernails and cracks for nails can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that wet lotion be used to prevent hand drying that could cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water is not available and soap is not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash hands: water spilling out of a towering canister or bottled tobacco, with openings made and (or) use of gold if necessary, such as in developing countries; water-saving solutions exist in areas with limited water (e.g., in schools or rural areas in developing countries) such as pocket taps and other low-cost options.
A knife pedal cane is a simple construction consisting of a bag hanging on a rope and a knife lever that should be pressed to hold water and a piece of soap should be used.
An effective handshake is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The growing volume of research shows that paper towels are far more sanitary than hand - drying electrical dryers installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, in London, sponsored a study sponsored by the European Symposium on the Production of Paper Sulphate and Slatt; this study was a comparison of the hygiene of paper cloths, hand-holding dry air dryers and more modern hand-flow air dryers.
After washing and drying the hands in hot air drying, the total number of bacteria on finger cushions was found to increase by 194 per cent on average, and 254 per cent on ladones.
It also turned out that after washing and drying the hands in the dryer with airflow, the total quantity of bacteria on the pillows of fingers increased by 42% and on the landlocks by 15%.
After washing and drying paper towels, the average number of bacteria on finger cushions decreases to 76 per cent, while on ladons 77 per cent, and scientists have also tested several visitors to toilet rooms and toilet environments for each type of drying.
The direct air dryer, which releases 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 m/h), is capable of squeezing the micro-organisms from the hand and from its own unit, potentially causing other users of the toilet room and the sanusule to a radius of up to 2 m.
The use of warm - air dryers spreads microorganisms in a radius of up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
There was no large distribution of micro-organisms when using paper-based canvass. In 2005, TíV Produkt und Umwell conducted a study to assess various hand drying methods.
There are the following changes in the number of bacteria, depending on the hands drying method:
There are many different hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared with a dryer of paper to a paper towel.
Cleaning up hands with disinfectants can be an alternative solution during travel without soap or water.
The decontamination device for the hands on the alcohol basis shall contain not less than 60 per cent alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became compulsory long after Hungarian physician Ignatz Landmelweiss found it to be very effective (1846) in preventing disease in a state of emergency.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices is indeed helping to reduce infection.
Hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and resist each part of the hand.
Hands should be thoroughly lost to each other by gnashing fingers.
If under the fingernails are dirty, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water in their hands, it is important to wash them properly and wipe them out with a clean towel.
The paper towel should be used after drying the hands, closing the tap and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors.
This prevents the hands from being re-polluted from these surfaces.
The aim of washing hands in medical facilities is to remove pathogenic micro-organisms (microbes) and to prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before they touch patients and thus spread micro-organisms.
One study showed that the right washing of hands and other basic procedures could reduce the level of blood-related infections in the use of the catheter by 66 per cent and that the World Health Organization had published a leaflet depicting the standard hand washing and handling procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open to public discussion.
The review was co-sponsored by Witby.
If regulatory compliance is required, commercial devices can be used to measure the performance and verify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization stands for “five moments” when washing hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before using antiseptics, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to hand washing ("medical" or "antimic" soap") helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgical operations are performed or in an environment with high concentrations of antibiotic organisms. Crans must be cleaned before surgery can be performed, which can be turned on and excluded without touching their hands, and a little chlorhexide or water should be used to repair the hands, sterilized hands drying, steriloids for friction and other sterilistic tools for nailing.
All ornaments must be removed.
This procedure requires hand washing and putting up to the elbow usually for two to six minutes.
There's no need to lose your hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During hibernation, the water with the bilge shall not fall back on the hands.
After washing, they dry their hands with scavenger cloth and wear a surgical robe.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use antiseptics for the hands before and after the procedures for the care of the sick person.
In order to combat staphic infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of the washing was most beneficial to hand washing and that very few additional benefits were obtained when hand washing was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to the washing of antibacterial soap, conventional soap can lead to more than a threefold increase in the frequency of bacterial communicable diseases transmitted through food, a comparison of the arm resistance by alcohol-impaired solution and the washing of hands by antibacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds for each procedure, showed that hand processing by alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand alcohol solutions in reducing the number of influenza virus A H1N1 and the Clostrid Diphfination dispute, and hand hygiene activities in health facilities may include hand washing training, improving the availability of alcohol-containing solutions for hands, and providing written and oral reminders to staff about the need to wash their hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective interventions in various health facilities.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap has been recognized as cost-effective and important for improving health and even nutrition.
However, the lack of stable water, soap, or hand washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to adjust regular hand washing habits.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few handwashed cranes in each private or public toilet, although cheap ways to organize hand washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits, not lack of soap or water.
Promoting and stimulating hand washing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness about hand washing benefits and lead to long-term changes in people's behaviour.
Monitoring and evaluation of results is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
A system-wide analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve the health situation of the hands in the lower middle-income countries, health and epidemiological supervision at the community level is effective, while public marketing campaigns are less effective, one example of the promotion of hand washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's Star Approach approach, which promotes the implementation of simple economic measures in schools that encourage washing of soap-hands by pupils and other health requirements.
With minimal standards, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
The installation of handsholders is one of the possible measures taken by information campaigns on hand hygiene to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
The World Hand washing Day (Global Hand Washing Day) is another example of an information campaign aimed at behavioural change, as a result of the coroner's pandemic of 2019-2020, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of hand language.
Some studies have considered the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in comparison with DALYs (retained years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that hand washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitation measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for vulnerable people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and the “founder of modern care for patients”.
At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by the rotting smells called misadventures.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of digestive disease and health-related infections, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important prevention measure.
As a result of the outbreak of pig influenza in 2009 and the COVIDE pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands and soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with “right hand washing techniques” were scattered near the hands in public toilets, as well as in office buildings and airports.
The phrase “reasoning hands” is an expression of one's reluctance to accept responsibility for something or to participate in something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate ‘ washed his hands ’ when making a decision to crucify Jesus Christ, a phrase that later became more common in some English communities.
In the "Macbeth" Shakespeare, Lady Mcbeth begins to wash her hands arbitrarily in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain symbolizing an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes she committed herself and encouraged her husband to commit.
It has also been established that people who remember or observe any non-ethical act tend to wash their hands more often than other people, and to them their hands are more important.
It is also less likely that those who have been able to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other “cleaning” complicating activities, such as volunteering.
A symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual of many religions, including Baha'ism, Hinduism, tevilah, and netile-dayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam, and religions also prescribe the sanitary washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam are required to wash their hands after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, hand washing is deemed necessary before and after each meal.
Monitoring of production factors related to COVID-19
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19 means the use of techniques to ensure safety and health to control risk and combat coroner of 2019 (CAVID-19).
The proper monitoring of risks in the workplace depends on the place and work, is based on the assessment of risks, the seriousness of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Department of Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that posts with lower risk had minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and that in such cases basic measures were required to combat infection, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home for signs of illness, respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Average risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVII-19 but are likely to be infected because of the current spread of the disease in society or in international travel.
This category may include workers who communicate with the public, for example in schools, working environments with a high population density, and in some large retail shops.
Risk management measures for such a group include, in addition to basic prevention measures, high-impact air filters, shields and available personal protections in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical staff and morgues who are in contact with a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 are in a high risk category, while the risk increases to a very high level in the conduct of such personnel procedures accompanied by aerosol formation or the collection/testing from a human being with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk management measures suitable for such staff include the use of safety engineering equipment, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protection equipment suitable for the purpose.
COVID-19 may have different types of exposure in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from the workplace because of their own illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of possible contamination.
Business templates may change both with respect to the types of goods for which demand is available and the ways in which such goods are purchased (e.g., procurement during non-drink periods with delivery or maintenance, without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be a difference in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Plan for Disaster Preparedness and Response may be used in the organization of protection.
The plans address the risks associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of contamination, risks posed by homes and communities, as well as risks to individual workers, such as old age or chronic illness.
The plans also set out the controls needed to address such risks, as well as plans for emergency interventions for situations that may arise from the epidemic.
Plans for epidemic preparedness and response may be subject to national or state recommendations.
Some of the objectives of responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, to protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, to maintain business operations and to minimize negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chain.
Responses affect the severity of the disease in the business community.
The hierarchy of means of risk control is a structure widely used in providing occupational safety and health to group them according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 is not addressed, the most efficient engineering equipment is then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
The engineering security equipment implies the isolation of staff from job risk and does not rely on the conduct of the employee, which may be the most economically beneficial solution.
The administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures requiring action from the employee or staff member.
Personal protection equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to address certain risks.
All types of personal protection should be selected according to the worker ' s threat, sized (e.g. respirators), used continuously and appropriately, regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Department of Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) believes that posts with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their counterparts.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic, recommended for all jobs, include frequent and careful washing of hands, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, implementation of a respiratory label, including the closure of their mouth at cough and tea, provision of salphet and garbage containers, readiness for distant or replacement work, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and deinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons potentially infected is a critical step for the protection of workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff members with acute respiratory symptoms remain at home until the heat is stopped, lack of high body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of jape drugs or other medications that eliminate symptoms, and require flexibility of the patient's policies, allowing staff to stay at home to care for sick family members, and ensuring that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact not more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of a COVID-19 infection, but there is a possibility that SARS-COV-2 is infected because of the spread of disease in the society of the business area or because of the recent visits of such person to COVID-19 sites.
Such categories include public-aware persons, such as in schools, high-density workers and some large retailers, and safety and safety for such groups and higher-risk groups, such as high-risk air filters, increased ventilation rates, physical barriers such as transparent plastic shields, and the installation of windows for customer services without exit, and administrative measures for such groups and higher-risk groups include recommendations for sick workers to remain at home, replace personal meetings with virtual equipment, replacement schedules, halting non-critical visits to COVID-19 sites, developing emergency communication plans, including a forum for responding staff, providing timely training for workers on risk factors of COVID-19 and protection measures, training workers requiring the use or equipment, the proper use of such facilities, the provision of resources and a work environment conducive to personal hygiene, requiring regular washing of personnel, providing relevant training for workers on risk factors of COVID-19 and providing protection measures, training for employees who need to use or equipment, the proper use of such facilities, the provision of resources and a personal hygiene environment, the requirement for regular washing of manual, the control of personnel on risk factors, and the protection of employees, and the protection of employees, the staff, and the use of staff members of the staff, the staff, the staff, and the staff, and the staff, and the staff, the staff, iterterterterterter, the unit, the unit, the unit, the ivities of the unit, and the unit, the unit, the unit of the unit, and the staff, and the staff, and the unit of the unit of the unit of the unit of the staff of the unit of the staff, and the unit of the unit of the unit of the unit of the unit of the staff, and the staff, and the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the unit of the staff of the unit of the staff of the staff of the staff, and the staff of the staff, and the staff of the unit of the unit of the unit of the unit of the unit of the unit of the unit of the unit of the unit of the unit of the staff, and the staff of the unit of the staff, and the staff, and the staff of which the staff of the unit of the staff, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the staff of the unit of the unit of the police, and the unit of the staff of the staff of which of which of which of which of which of which of which of which of which of the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the unit of the police, and the police, and the police, and the unit of the unit of the unit of the police, and the unit of the police, and the unit of the , and the police, and of which of which of which of which of which of which of which of which of the police, the police, and the police, and the unit of the police, and the unit of the unit of the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the unit of the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the unit of the unit of the unit of, and the police and the unit, and the staff, and the police and the staff.
In rare cases, the carrying of respirators may be necessary for the employees of such a group of risks.
If a person gets sick on the plane, measures such as isolation of a sick person from another person by 6 feet, the appointment of a member of the crew to care for a sick person, the provision of a mask to the sick person, or the request to cover his nose and mouth with a salphet in his cough or tea.
Secondary crew members must wear one-time medical gloves when approaching a patient traveler or in contact with a physical fluid or potentially infected surfaces and possibly additional personal protections if a patient’s heat, regular cough or breathing difficulty.
The gloves and other single objects used should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces should be subsequently cleaned and decontaminated. In cases of commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, safety measures include the delay of a sick journey, self-insulgence and immediate reporting of a medical centre on a ship in the event of heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical check must be carried out in an isolated cabin of such a person; in the case of schools and childcare institutions, CDC recommends that a short-term closure be held to clean or defect the infection if the infected person was present in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average rate of infection in the community, social care strategies may be introduced, for example, to cancel visits to personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as exercise or singing, coffee intake, increasing the distance between parties, regulating arrivals and care, limiting non-material visits, and using a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
In the local community, long-term non-visitment measures may be considered in addition to social care strategies; for law enforcement officials with daily responsibilities, direct health risks are considered low, according to CDC.
It is recommended that law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 should follow the same instructions as required by the ambulance doctors, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers must clear and disinfect their uniform belts and remove them until they are reused by domestic cleaning aerosols or by anti-arrival, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and the disposal of used personal protective equipment, as well as to use and erase clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
The high-risk posts include medical, support, laboratory and medical staff who are in contact with patients with confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of contamination in the procedures followed by aerosol formation or in sampling/treatment from persons with confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID-19 infection.
Procedures for the formation of aerosols include umbrellas, procedures for coughing, bronze, some dental procedures and surveys, or the collection of samples of invasive methods.
Workers of high-risk morgues include staff working on the bodies of persons with confirmed disease or suspicion of damage to COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such officers carry out an attack, they are classified as very high-risk; additional engineering and safety equipment for such groups includes the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed disease or suspicion at COVID-19, including procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.
Special negative ventilation may be effective in some health and morgues.
Samples should be treated with the precautions provided for level of biological safety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to separate waiting zones, depending on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protections, OSHA recommends the use of respirators to workers working up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed illness or suspicion of the SARS-Cov-2 attack, as well as to persons conducting procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.
In the United States, NIOSH respirators approved for N95 filter or higher should be used as part of an integrated written programme for respiratory protection, which sets out the requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort to a staff member, and WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not a physicologic fluid.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the patient reception point.
WHO recommends that people collecting breathing samples from patients with or without procedures accompanied by aerosols should wear surgical masks, protective glasses or face protection screens, robe and gloves.
In procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, the respirator N95 or FFP2 should be used instead of a surgical mask.
In view of the insufficient availability of personal protection facilities around the world, WHO recommends that such protection be minimized by taking advantage of remote medicine capabilities, physical barriers, such transparent eye cells, ensuring access to a patient infected by COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of personal protections only that are necessary for a specific purpose, the prolonged use of the same respiratory agent, without removal, while working with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protection equipment, and recommending not to use masks for those without symptoms.

COVER: [Coved-19] Loading and preparation for the future
DATA/ for Administration: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
EQUALITY: CC0: No protected rights
This month, we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the relationships between people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the capacity for compassion, cooperation and development of communities around the world, which is the foundation of such an organization.
We have observed comradeial and caring relationships between all our colleagues, as reflected in electronic correspondence, calls and chats — a remarkable confirmation of the fact that fortunately amazing people work with us.
I speak with great gratitude and pride about you as my colleagues.
Last week, I was told of our appreciation for our work.
I have been reminded of the importance for the world to have access to Wikipedia right now, and of the value for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And it's possible because of your work, whether it's about making websites work, paying for our colleagues or protecting community security.
The world needs the information provided in Wikipedia, and this is more important today than ever before.
At such times, not only what we do but how we do it is important to achieve meaningful results for peace.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way we work together, beginning with the coming week.
Adjusting our work arrangements and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the "c-team" team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
During communication, we considered our ideas on how best to address the current situation and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to remove the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to step back, let's do that.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff:
According to our expectations, we will need to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before subsequent orders are received.
We do not announce the weekend: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purpose of our mission.
But the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether to care for your family, to buy food, or to go to a doctor, your well - being is our priority number one.
We don't follow your working time.
If you're ill, you shouldn't work.
That's understandable and undeniably, but we'll mention it.
There is no need for a sick sheet or a delay: simply inform your supervisor and help the team review the calendar and work schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, please report Brian from T&C Ops to ensure that T&C is able to provide support and proper management attention to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to honour the obligations of our contractors and staff with an hourly rate of payment.
Each person will be paid in accordance with the normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This includes periods of illness when you can't work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can produce amazing results, especially in these times.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your leader so that we know what to expect and we can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered to be significant.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundrazing (other than others) perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and focus on ensuring support, which is essential for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we're just focusing on the most important projects.
Delays today do not mean negative consequences in the future.
We are not planning to work “two more to get lost” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to meet non-real times for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timetables where possible.
What's happening to the APP (annual plans)?
In order to build on the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the implementation dates of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our plan for the years 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, enabling staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care, while all who need or who want to work will have a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, present relevant information to representatives and teams on the next steps immediately after confirmation has been received.
Thank the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to the many precautions, we have hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect the entire surface of the office in San Francisco.
They used the medical class ' s anti-virus decisions to disinfect all surfaces as well as the reception and elevator cholera through which access to our floor is possible.
The building is subject to its own rules of care, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in Colombia (DC) is located on the Web site of WeWork, which shared with us and all the staff in DC with their COVID-19 regulations.
Last week, our office in the District of Colombia was completely moved to remote jobs in accordance with instructions issued in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of rental of premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue but can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working away for the first time.
Our old colleagues, working away, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider the possibility of breaking them into a multi-day course.
Identify clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and distribute information material in advance.
Use video communications by default to facilitate interaction and communication by using tools such as Google Docs and Zom.
For ease, appoint a focal point — a person who will monitor questions in the chat room and monitor the list of speakers as well as the note holder (or joint notes).
If you need to use a convenient headway, seek the Technical Support Service by e-mail.
Take advantage of Wellness Remurment when you buy a piece of lunch.
Connect to #remoties in the Black channel to talk to colleagues about work distributed.
HR Operations is examining guidelines on ergonomics available in web-based formats to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the grants of the community to cancel the mass events funded by WikiLeaks, such as “editathons”, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may entail the impossibility of carrying out concerted grant activities, and no one will be fined for their forced delays or for changing those objectives.
In the coming week, we will follow up on additional guidance on WikiLeaks, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The general moods of the global community are not only a disappointment because of the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief for mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and not just.
In terms of perspective, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide space for the community to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in contact on issues related to COVID-19.
We will send an invitation to your calendar for the Special Staff Meeting to be held next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take the opportunity to further share relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together connecting.
We're together in this situation, and we're ready to help everything we can.
In doing so, you can continue to receive information from such e-mail, and other important information from COVID-19 is from Office WikiLeaks.
CRT will update these pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
When questions of travel, activities, key working flows, information issues or other assistance are raised, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and liaison as needed.
If there are issues of confidentiality, go to Brian Judan (Bryan Judan), director of HR International Global Operations.
No such changes should be taken as a rejection of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a fundamental new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world through the necessary services.
Our planned work will wait until the right time.
Now is the time to support each other and to create a space for important work that will take place in future weeks and perhaps months.
In order for this to happen, we need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families, as well as to work with maximum efficiency as soon as the need arises.
Now please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Ketherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Sony S) and the remaining members of Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janie U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-swift enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme attached to the outer surface(s) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestine.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-predictant (ACE), reducing the levels of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7) by making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a point of entry for some coronary diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-swift ferentin 2 is a cincing metal field located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The blue ACE2 contains the N-end of the peptidex dom2 and the C-enda transport domain of renal amino acid calorie.
ACE2 is a type I single-passed membrane protein, its fertilizing active domain falls on the surface of the lungs and other tissue cells.
The non-cellular domain of ACE2 is removed from a transminated domain by another enzyme known as a masterpiece, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released with the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar lung cell type II cells, the endoti cells of the thin intestine, the arterial and venous endothelial cells and the smooth muscle cells of most organs.
The biosynthesis ACE2 and RNA are also found in the cortex of the brain, the striatum, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE fissures angiotensin I in angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, pumps carbon dioxide into amino acid amino acid phenylanin from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Vial-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzizes it in a water-absolitant angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also release a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bridine, apexin, neurotensine, Dinorphine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is present in the event of Hartunup disease.
As a transmrated protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronarys, including HCov-NL63; SARS-Cov (SARS virus); and SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19)
Strictly speaking, linking the S1 casings of SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov2 to the fermentative domain ACE2 on the surface of the cell leads to endocytosis and transfer of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosoms inside the cell.
This inlet process also requires that the protein S of sulphur prosthesis of the TMPRSS2, which is now being studied as a potentially therapeutic tool, has led some to believe that lower ACE2 levels in cells can help combat infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing the standard treatment of PPF and BRA inhalers.
According to a systematic review and metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared with the control group”.
Moreover, “plumbing was also reduced by patients receiving APF inhalers who were at higher risk, suffering from pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure.
The use of PPF inhibitors was also associated with the reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than those with a general risk of pneumonia.”
The recombinant ACE2 (rHACE2) is expected to be a new treatment for acute lung injuries and is likely to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the form of acute respiratory deficiency syndrome caused by hypopolysahads.
The half-life of rhACE2 is about 10 hours for people and the start of operation is 30 minutes, in addition to 24 hours for exposure.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with the intolerance of classical renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inflammatory systems) or for diseases which increase the circulation of angiotensin II. rHACE2 was assessed in clinical trials for acute respiratory respiratory disss.
The COVID-19 annexes are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in epidemiological investigation in the context of the coroner's pandemic of 2019-2020, i.e., identification of persons (“contact”) who could contact an infected person.
In some regions, many applications officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options for the Network Tracking applications have been developed.
This led to a discussion of confidentiality issues, especially those systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of applications.
The softer options include using Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of the user to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their integration efforts with support from Bluetooth to their own Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipai, has launched an app that allows citizens to verify whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and Singapore uses an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be handed over to the Government, and northern Macedonia has launched the "StopKoronea!" app, which works on Bluetooth to help track contact with potentially infected people and ensure operational communication with health services.
The annex was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the annex was awaiting registration in Google PlaySore and Apple App Stor.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking annex was being developed at the final stage and would be available for deployment within a few weeks, with similar applications scheduled to be launched in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on the Singapore Annex TraceTogether and the BlueTrace Protocol, and Russia intends to use a geozoning application designed to ensure that those diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise from applications, including false operations and potential inefficiencies in the case of an application of only a small portion of the population.
In view of the concern about the proliferation of misleading or harmful “kinghole” annexes, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that could offer their coronavirus-related applications in App Stor, including only “formal” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
The confidentiality campaign raised concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance of the population through the coronavirus-related annexes; in particular, the question was raised of whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such oversight.
The organizations have declared eight conditions for their public projects:
Monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
The enhancement of monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by limitation clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19 dissemination;
The safety and anonymity of data should be protected and evidence of such security should be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude instances of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as should the right of citizens to respond to abuses;
All relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and members of marginalized groups, should be “participated”. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reports on Parties (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the ongoing surveillance problem of removing the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it becomes unnecessary.
In some countries, network tracking is used instead of applications, which excludes loading of an application and the possibility of avoiding traceability.
In Israel network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to basic position data also have major potential issues of confidentiality.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal position data; a number of systems with confidentiality have been developed that use central servers only for communication purposes (see below).
In South Korea, a contact tracking system was used that did not use applications as a basis.
Instead of using a special annex, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking of mobile devices and card transactions, and then combined them to produce text messages that were sent to potential infected persons.
Not only did the Government use this information to warn citizens of potential contact with infected persons, but it also made information about the location of the public, which was made possible because of significant changes in the protection legislation that had been introduced since the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
Tracking a confidential contact is a well established concept, with a significant volume of research literature dated at least 2013, and as of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups worked on confidential solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEP-PT is a coordinating effort that includes both a centralized and a decentralized approach and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracing with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols for confidentiality, mobile contact tracking (PACT) mechanisms, and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identification data never leave the device and that all comparisons occur there.
The Private Group, MIT Media Lab, develops SafePaths, a platform to ensure confidentiality in the collection and use of position data or pathways to track COVID-19 distribution.
The work of the platform is based on the studies in Apps Gongue: Maining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies, which was also originally based on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware to enable users to exchange confidential data on the location and state of health with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of the data.
On 5 April 2020, a global TCN coalition was established by the groups that share the same approach and use similar protocols to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of tracking and alert applications, a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official annex.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that allows confidentiality to be maintained.
They also published the technical specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be in three stages:
deployment of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications to monitor the movement of newly infected citizens, but with data confidentiality
In integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve ongoing surveillance problems, first run the system through the updating of the operating system and then removed it in the same way after the threat disappeared.
Reprofiling a drug (also known as reprofiling, diversion, task change or therapeutic diversion of drugs) is a reprofiling of approved medication to treat a disease or a medical condition other than that originally prescribed in development.
This is one of the areas of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective methods for COVID-19 treatment.
Other research activities include the development of a cOVID-19 vaccine and the transfuse of reconnaissant plasma. SARS-Cov-2 contains about 66 proteins exposed to drugs, each with several liganda-linking sites.
The analysis of these linkd sites provides an appropriate basis for the development of an effective anti-virus drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important tools for SARS-Cov-2 are the papyna-like prosase, the RNA-independent polymerase, the helica, the protein S and the ADF-ribophosphase.
Hussain AA and the co-authors, in their pre-school study, examined several candidate compounds that had been optimized and analysed their similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to expedite the development of a highly effective drug against SAS-Cov-2 to be recommended for clinical research.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in treating certain atomic diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied under the “Community” clinical test.
Governor Andrew Coomao of New York announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquin tests would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquin sulphate and chlorophosphate according to an urgent application permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical test process and is only permitted under the EUA as a pilot treatment for emergency care for patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical test schemes.
CDC stated that “the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infection has not yet been established”.
Doctors say they use the drug when there's no other way out.
The Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquin, combined with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale studies are carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
China's clinical trials in Uhan and Shenzhen revealed that the pavipire is “unequivocally effective”.
The 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug received a negative result on average four days later, while 45 patients who did not take the drug had 11 days of the disease.
A study was carried out in Uhan, where 240 pneumonia patients were monitored, one half of whom received pavipire, and the other half were Umphenoids.
The Italian pharmaceutical department reminded the public that results that showed the effectiveness of the drug were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase drugs in Japan to supplement its stockpiles and that they would be delivered to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19 would be used by military resources.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sinzo Abe informed the Trump Administration of the possibility of purchasing a drug, and the drug may be less effective in untreated cases.
It may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who try to get pregnant.
One study on the combination of anti-virus drugs narcoin and Ritovinar (Caltra) concluded that “no effective drug use has been detected”.
The drugs have been developed to inflammate the replica of HIV through prosthesia.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado was trying to modify drugs to find a connection to the SRS-Cov-2 prosthesia. The scientific community criticized the reprofiling of drugs that had been designed specifically for the treatment of HIV and AIDS.
WHO has included a combination of lotiver and rytovanar in the international “Community” test.
Remdiscipliner was created and developed by Glad Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections, and later by Glad Science staff discovered that the remeducifier had an anti-virus activity in vitro with regard to numerous velo-, pneumo-, paramixo- and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with anti-virus treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that a remediclist may have a higher genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical tests are under way, including two at Cleveland University clinics, one at moderate patients, and the other at more severe patients.

Some antibiotics that were considered potentially suitable for COVID-19 treatment:
Topilysumb (Receptor anti-IL-6): Approved in China.
Also in Italy and China, see Tocizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coroner of 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that a vaccine against the SARS-Cov-2 virus would be available earlier than 18 months.
In April, five candidates for vaccines were studying phase I security.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread throughout the world, resulting in significant investments in the development of the vaccine and its research activities.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-COV-2.
As announced in April, the key tasks of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are ensuring the required speed, productive capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, there were 10 different technology platforms for an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I security research:
Nucleric acid (DNC and RNA) (Phase I and vaccine drug: Moderna, INC-1273)
Virus vector (Phase I processor and vaccine drug: CanSino Biologics, anoxic vector type 5)
According to researchers at CEPI in April, 115 potential vaccines are at an early stage of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79 according to the University of Milan); in addition, 37 more vaccine candidates were reported, but little information is available (suggestedly in the planning or development phase).
During phases I to II, safety and immunity testing is generally done at randomified, placebo controlled and at several sites with a simultaneous definition of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III of the tests usually involves more participants, including the control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for disease prevention effectiveness and also track side effects for optimal doses.
Of the 79 active development vaccines, 74 have not yet been tested in human beings (still in doclinical studies).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular prosthetic vaccine that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.

The total investment of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is US$ 29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Invoío, Novaex, universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers General College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-implementing RNA vaccin from COVID-19.
The vaccine drug was developed within 14 days of a Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced $275 million for 96 medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University initiatives.
About the same time, the Canadian Government announced that it would provide $192 million specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as for plans to establish a national vaccine bank, which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new corona outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the Pittsburg University Medical School reported testing PittCovac, a possible anti-COVID-19 vaccine on mice, stating that “MNA had introduced sub-unitary SAS-Cov-2 S1 vaccines, generating strong responses from antigen-special antibodies [in mice] that had occurred two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be produced in the form of an inflammatory spray.
DNA will be used to reproduce within human bacteria and to form harmless viral particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop an anti-aircraft system against the SAS-Cov-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined the resources of IBM supercomputers combined with the resources of Hewlett Packard Weprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they can have other advantages than those of disease prevention.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies to assess the effectiveness of animal-based vaccines, characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to contain biosafety 3 infection in the treatment of living viruses and for international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines vs. SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, SARS does not have a drug or protective vaccine that is safe and effective for people.
According to research work published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and medications for the treatment of accompanimental pneumonia has been a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world.
When MEERS began to distribute, it was believed that the study of SARS at the time could be a standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents against MERS-Cov infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (a DNA-based) MERS vaccine that had passed phase I of clinical testing in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were virus vector vaccines and were under development, two of which were aborigines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-Vitorical (MVA-MERS-S).
The theory of conspiracy was spread in social networks, stating that the COVID-19 virus is not new and that it already exists.
Social networking publications quoted the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents on the genetic order of other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARS coroner, as well as on vaccines for these strains.
Coronavor is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and heavy breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, abhorrence, and stomach pain.
From the first symptoms to the peak of the disease, it is usually about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases result in light symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and polyorganic deficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people were killed.
More than 568,000 people have recovered: The virus is mostly spreading through close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops that are released into the air at cough, tea or conversation.
Although these droplets are formed by extraction, they usually pose a threat to land or surface, but are not passed through the air at long distances.
People are also infected with an contaminated surface and then with their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days after symptoms have been detected, although it can be disseminated both before symptoms and in later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymethical chain reaction with reverse transmission in real time (RT-PCR) on a sample taken, like a natto mask.
The use of masks is recommended for patients with a suspicion of disease and for those who care for them.
Recommendations on the use of medical masks vary: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use and others require them.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
The local spread of the disease has been registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Persons infected may not have symptoms or symptoms of influenza, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and cleaning.
Emergency symptoms include poor breathing, constant pain or chest dementia, lack of consciousness, difficulty in waking up, inflammation of the face or lips; if the symptoms above are present, medical attention should be sought without delay.
There may be less symptoms of an upper respiratory disorder, such as snorkeling, frowning, or throat pain.
There are also different percentages of stomach-oxidant symptoms, such as toxins, rudders and diarrhea.
Some cases reported in China at first showed only a sense of chest and student heart pressure.
In some cases, the disease can progress as it develops in pneumonia and polyorganic deficiency, resulting in death.
This is called the incubation period.
COVID-19 is usually between five and six days but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people have symptoms that occur within 11.5 days of infection, and the data show that the symptoms do not all infected people.
The role of such insatiable carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence indicates that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected people with unspoiled disease is currently unknown and is only being studied; and Korean Disease Control and Prevention Centres (KCDC) reported that in 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus during the disease were insatiable.
The National Health Commission of China has begun to include in its daily report since 1 April; of the 166 cases registered on that date, 130 (78 per cent) have been turned down at the time of testing.
Both the wet and the saline may have a high concentration of the virus.
There is more droplets in the air by loud speaking than the normal volume of speech.
A study conducted in Singapore found that a drop of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) can be applied with an open cough.
The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission of the virus by bio-erosetic means is still possible, and air testing by air collectors working in corridors outside the room of the people has revealed the presence of a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as injection and cardio-drugal renegation (SDR), may lead to dilution and, consequently, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may be spread through feces, however, that risk is considered low; the virus is one of the most common symptoms; the spread of the virus may be before symptoms, but it is not.
The staff of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (EDC) claim that it is not yet fully clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient is usually infected by 2-3 other people; the virus is capable of surviving on the surface for several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the paper surface, the virus could live for one day, on the plastic surface (spire) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These indicators, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
When properly used, soap and cleaning agents have a quite useful effect in combating infection: soap destroys the fat layer of protection by deactivating it, and can remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconychloride and chlorhexide glucose (surgical decontamination), are less effective against the virus, and during a study in Hong Kong, the saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
Five out of six patients had the first test to show the highest blood virus concentration, and six had the highest blood virus on the second day of testing.
Heavy acute respiratory coroner syndrome 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is a new heavy coronary respiratory syndrome detected by three people with pneumonia in a group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-Cov-2 virus also appear in the natural coronary.
While outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by the domestic soap that covers its protective shell.
The lungs are the organ most affected by COVID-19, since the virus penetrates the locomotive cells through angiotensin fermental fermentation 2 (ACE2), which is most common in alveolar lung cell II.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates into the carcasse with the characteristic surface glycoproteine, the chip (heap).
12 per cent of the infected people admitted to a hospital in Uhana were diagnosed with severe myocardial injuries, which are more common in a serious form of illness.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the system-wide inflammatory response and the progression of the immune system, but the severe damage to the myocardial may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 adoptors are in large quantities in the heart as they participate in the work of this body.
The high frequency of trombozzes (31%) and venous trombombombol (25%) were observed in patients in OIT with COVID-19 and may indicate poor projections. The evatopia of patients who died from COVID-19 showed diphesus alveolar injuries (DAD) and lymphocyte inflammable inflammable infections in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropic for ACE2-depressant respiratory cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of system-wide hyperflammation.
In particular, it has been found that the HM-CITF-CDF T-cells relate to inflammation of inflammatory monocells with IL-6 and heavy lung pathology among patients with COVID-19.
Limphic infrastructures were also found at the opening.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
A half-time real-time chain response (RT-CPD) is a standard test method.
The test shall normally be carried out on respiratory samples obtained from the nose, but may also be used as a sample of the nose brush or wet.
The results are usually produced for a period of between a few hours and two days.
Blood tests may also be taken, but they require two blood samples between two weeks, and their results are of no direct significance.
China’s scientists have succeeded in identifying the strain of the coronaurus and publishing its genetic sequence so that the scientists at laboratories around the world can develop their own polymerized chain reaction tests (PCRs) to detect the presence of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibodies tests that could detect current infection, as well as possible infection in the past, were under development but were not yet widespread.
China ' s experience in studying the test results showed that the accuracy of these tests was only 60 to 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Authority (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test and authorized its application at the end of the month, and the diagnosis guidelines issued by Zhennan Uhang University Hospital indicated how clinically and epidemiologically risk-based infection was detected.
Bilateral multi-dimensional sub-participatory focusses of the type of “maternal glass” with off-farmer, asymmetrical and asteriric distributions are frequent symptoms identified at an early stage of the disease.
Sub-divisional dominance, symptom of bulk bridge (distant detonation of partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are developed as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic injuries and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
Main results of an open-up pathological study:
Macroscopy: pleurit, percarditis, compaction and lungs
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
slight shape of pneumonia: lung permeability, pneumatic hyperplasis, large acupuncture pneumatic pneumatic cells, interstitial inflammation with lymphal inflation and the formation of multinuclear giant cells
Heavy form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exhume.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ODS) and heavy hypopsymismia.
Survivor pneumony: Organization of exhusses in alveolar pallets and light intersistant fibrosis.
Blood: Diffin intravascular detonation (AF-Synodm); lecoyeriteblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding human places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, respecting breathing hygiene, and avoiding exposures to eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends that the mouth and nose should be covered by a cough or tea or, in the absence of a straw, that the mouth and nose be covered in the interior of the arm area.
It is recommended that after coughing or teaing, a good hygiene procedure be conducted for the hands.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of cloth masks in public places, in particular to limit the transmission of infections to persons with unspoiled diseases, which aim to reduce the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and businesses were closed, to limit the movement of citizens and to eliminate large public events.
Recommendations on distance also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
Medicines with proven effectiveness against COVID-19 do not exist, since completion of the vaccine development is expected no earlier than 2021, the main part of the control against COVID-19 is a drop in the peak known as “leverage on pay”.
CDC also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting a toilet or with severe hand-pollution, and before eating and after shrivelling, coughing or scading.
CDC also recommends the use of disinfecting alcohol (at least 60 per cent alcohol content) to handle hands, but only when soap and water are not available. For regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two recipes for local production.
These compositions use ethanol or isopropanel, which have anti-microbiotic activity.
Hydrogen transfer is used to address a bacterial dispute in alcohol and is not a suitable tool for antiseptic hand handling.
Helicol is added as a water user.
Supportive therapy, which may include infuseive therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs, is provided to patients.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they are infected with the virus wear a normal medical mask.
The extra-corporate membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used to address respiratory deficiency, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen immunity, respect for personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet is recommended.
Supportive treatments can be shown to patients with mild symptoms at an early stage of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China issued recommendations for care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive therapy and pulmonologists have combined the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions with a free IBC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For first-line symptoms, some health professionals recommend choosing paracetamola (acetaminophen) as compared to ibuprofen.
In carrying out procedures during which air pressure may occur, such as intubration or hand-stabling, precautions need to be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health facilities.
CDC recommends that the medical personnel who care for people from COVID-19 be placed in an air-cailing unit (AIIR), an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. CDC published recommendations on the use of personal protection (CWD) equipment during the pandemic.
Personal protective equipment recommended above is a protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves, and it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
Respirators N95 have been approved for industrial use, but FDA has permitted the use of these respirators in accordance with the emergency authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used not for safety instructions against a specific biological agent, they are not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of protective front screens or, in the extreme case, the production of masks on its own in the home environment.
In most cases, COVID-19 is not too heavy to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or of an alternative, but there is also a percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory deficiency associated with COVID-19 is currently being studied intensively, with some evidence showing that intubes can be avoided by means of a bow oxygen canal with intense air flow or two levels of positive pressure in the respiratory path.
As yet, it is not known whether any of these two methods are as effective for patients in critical condition as the ILL.
Some doctors have opted for pulmonary mechanical ventilation of the lungs if available because this method severely limits the spread of particles in the air compared to heavy-flow nose canals. The risk of severe disease for older persons (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
Many developed countries lack per capita hospital beds, and health systems resources are too limited to cope with the sharp rise in the incidence of COVID-19 infections in a serious form requiring hospitalization.
One study in China showed that 5% of patients were hospitalized at intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for lung ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30 per cent of the people hospitalized from COVID-19 end up in resuscitation.
The task of artificial emitting the lungs is complicated as acute respiratory respirator-synth (ARDS) developing at COVID-19 and oxygenation is increasing.
The IWL, with inhalation support and SCRR support, is necessary for the delivery of a maximum amount of oxygen into the lungs and to ensure a minimum damage to the ventilation, which may cause a pneumotorex to break.
In earlier fan models, high PIRs may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antivirus drugs are currently being tested.
The remunition is the most promising.
The development of new drugs may be up to 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the last stages of testing.
Anti-retroviral drugs can be tested for patients with severe diseases.
The WHO recommended volunteers take part in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.
Its application was not subject to clinical research to prove safety and effectiveness in treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number for entry.
The annex may detect “near contact” by means of surveillance data and thus determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also verify the status of the other three users.
If there is a potential risk, the annex not only recommends self-insegration, but also sends notification to local health authorities. Large data analysts collected from mobile phones, identification technologies, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and persons they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to monitor data from mobile phones of people allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to provide quarantine and protection for persons who may contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, Federal German government agencies were provided with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
The recognising technology has been introduced in Russia to identify quarantine violators.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, reported that cellular network operators reported that “40 per cent of the people still move in the territory”.
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour marathon programming of weekends with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersty Callulade, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the Crown.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Enhancing social exclusion, loneliness, concern about health, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming the mental health and well-being of people”.
Diseases can be slighted with slight or missing symptoms that resemble other common diseases of the upper respiratory pathways, such as common cold.
Light patients generally develop for two weeks, while patients with severe or critical health problems may need to be treated for between three and six weeks.
pregnant women may be at higher risk of obtaining heavy COVID-19 forms based on data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although such data for COVID-19 are not available.
For those with the most severe period of COVID-19, rapid progress can be made in acute respiratory respiratory diss syndrome (ARDS), which is respiratory deficiency, septic shock or polyorganic deficiency.
The complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, anomalous trimogenization, as well as problems with the heart, kidneys and liver.
The trombobitinomas, especially the increase in protrombino time, were described by 6 per cent of patients admitted to hospital since COVID-19, while the kidney function was broken by 4 per cent of the group.
About 20-30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have been raised liver enzymes (transamina).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and deaths was 10 days, five of which were in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to intensive care was seven days.
Early studies showed that the average time from the initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 per cent, and for women 1.7 per cent.
Hydropathological studies of post-mortem lung samples show difessing alveolar damage with quintile fibromyxoids in both lungs.
The pneumatic count has undergone viral cytopatic changes.
The outer appearance was similar to that of the acute respiratory disstras-Sandrom (ODS).
In 11.8 per cent of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were related to the rise of troponin or heart arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and access to health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary according to regional differences, as well as methodological difficulties.
Insufficiently efficiently counting light cases may lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.
Nevertheless, the fact that death occurs as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is undervalued.
In smokers, severe symptoms of COVID-19 were generally developed 1.4 times more frequently, and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die than non-smokers, and fear of long-term effects was expressed.
The administration of a Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who had recovered from the disease had reduced their lung volume by between 20 and 30 per cent, and their scans had been damaged.
Once cured, it can also lead to “Strategic therapy”.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether the surviving immunity against the virus was being developed for those who recovered from the virus.
According to other coronavores, this is considered likely, but it has also been reported that after the recovery from COVID-19, the coronavor tests were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that the prolonged prolonged period of the disease has occurred rather than the recurrence of the infection.
The virus is considered to be natural, animal-based and infectious.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the virus was almost entirely due to the transmission of the virus from the human person.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls 1 December 2019 the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, the date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to measure mortality.
All figures vary according to the region and the age of the disease, and they are also influenced by the level of testing, the quality of health systems, the use of treatment schemes, from the beginning of the outbreak of the disease to the population ' s parameters such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency-care codes for ICD10: U07.1 for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-Cov-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of the SARS-Cov-2 infection. The ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a certain period of time.
According to statistics provided by the University of Jones Hopkins, as of 17 April 2020, the total number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153,822/2 240,91).
This figure varies according to the region: some other methods include the determination of the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who die as a result of the disease, as well as the determination of the mortality rate as a result of the transmitted infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are time-bound and reflect the indicators of a certain segment of the population from the time of contamination to the end of the course of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced by all infected patients, the number of people infected can be understood by the presence of these antibodies.
At the outbreak center in Italy, Castillo d'Add, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In Gangelit city, the disease was spread during the celebration to young people with a relatively lower mortality rate, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies based on donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (00.04 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality levels are different for men and women.
According to studies carried out in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The most at-risk group is that of men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women is reduced only from the age of 90 years.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this discrepancy are not known, but can be genetic and behavioural.
Gender immunological differences, less smoking among women, associated diseases among men (e.g. hypertension among men younger than women) could lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were men, and 72 per cent of the deaths from COVID-19 were from men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not have gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ORVI have various gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to contract.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease COVID-19.
The Chief of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreiss, explains: “CO” means “king,” “VI” — virus, “D” — “disease”, and 19 — the year when the outbreak was detected for the first time: 31 December 2019.
The name has been chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by the international name recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called acute coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses the terms “COVID-19” and “COVID-19” in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as “kingdom”.
During the initial outbreak in Uhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as “kingyard” and “runkkinaviral”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in the name of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “air respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCov” as temporary names for the virus and disease.
Official names, “COVID-19” and “SARS-Cov-2”, were published on 11 February 2020.
Because of restrictions on the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials, such as pampoons to remove nose brushes, as well as details of IWL ' s machines.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame, while one of the local productions was re-edited and was able to type the required 100 valves per night.
Following the first COVID-19 outbreak, various theories of conspiracy, disinformation and femic information on the origin of the virus, its scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects were spread over the Internet at high speed.
Humans may be infected with the virus of other animals.
The findings did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At present, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or medication to treat it.
Various international research on vaccines and drugs from COVII-19 are currently being carried out by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial programme (SOLIDARRE), which aims to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is not yet a ready-made vaccine, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine-addicted drugs.
Both SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2 enter the human cells by means of the ACE2 receptor, so scientific developments use the results of previous studies conducted in SARS-Cov.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole-of-the-viion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to induce a quick immune response from the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the development of a sub-unit vaccine, aims at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-Cov-2, such research is aimed at destroying S schip protein, which helps the virus penetrate the receptor of the ACE2 receptor.
A third strategy is the development of cervical acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccin, new vaccine methodology).
Pilot vaccines developed for any of these strategies must be verified for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of the vaccine for four volunteers commenced in Seattle.
The vaccin contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Anti-tile increase was identified as a potential problem in the development of vaccines from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, over 300 active clinical tests are being conducted.
The drugs approved for malaria treatment were assessed in seven tests, four of them for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The reprofiling of anti-virus preparations is a major Chinese study; by the end of April, nine remeduciary studies were conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for COVID-19 was carried out. To this end, several other existing anti-virus drugs for COVID-19 treatment are also being considered, including remethur, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, a logaviar/Rytovinar, and a lognivore/Rytovinar combined with an interferon beta.
As of March 2020, preliminary data were available on the effectiveness of the application of the remedicier.
The clinical improvement was observed by patients receiving remunition as an exception.
Phase III of clinical testing was already under way in the United States, China and Italy, and the use of chloroquine previously used for malaria was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results were available.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities in China and Korea recommend the use of chloroquine.
Uchanan Institute of virology recommends one gram per day but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and could lead to a fatal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA authorized the immediate use of hydroxychloroquin and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. China ' s guidelines for the 7th edition also set out the Interferon, Fishery or Umphenyloid as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of fishfish are needed to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 in vitro.
Nitasocsanide was recommended for detailed study in vivo, showing the inflammation of SARS-Cov-2 in low concentrations, and studies have shown that SARS-Cov-2 should be treated with a receptor of ACE2 by the application of the neck protein of sulphur 2 transhambraced prosause (TMPRSS2).
Research into the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azitromycin has serious limitations that prevent the health community from using these treatments without further study.
hypercyctoquinemia may arise as a complications in the late stages of heavy COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties of hypercyctocin; a small study carried out by the National Health Commission of China included thcilysomub in the recommendations for treatment of coronerium.
This drug has reached the 2nd stage of the unannated test, which is carried out at the national level in Italy, after it has been successfully used in patients with severe diseases.
Combined with a blood serum analysis on ferricin to detect cytocin storms, it is designed to counter factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, FDA was approved by Interleucine-6 receptor enthroner on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of steriodioxide refracter syndrome caused by another cause, CAR.
To date, there has been no randomized and controlled evidence to prove that cilysmub is an effective means of treating cytocin release syndrome.
Transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by immunized systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 to the people who need them is now treated as non-vacin passive immunization.
The strategy has been tested to treat patients from SARS, but its results have not been convincing.
The neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can protect against SARS-Cov-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as anti-lying cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytes, may be used.
Other passive antibody treatments, such as manufactured monopolized antitels, are in the process of being developed.
The use of a reconvasive blood serum consisting of a liquid part of the blood of the recovering patients and containing antibodies against the virus may be increased.

Lee Wenlian, a doctor at the Uhanya Central Hospital, who later contracted and died from COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
