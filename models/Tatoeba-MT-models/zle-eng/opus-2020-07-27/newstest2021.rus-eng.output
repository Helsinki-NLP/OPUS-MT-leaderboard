Semilarski v. Prosecutor's Office: The appeal of the former Vice-Mier Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that a decision on it is likely to be delivered in early September.
The courts of the two first courts refused to hear a Semlarski claim, but in April, the State Court of Justice accepted his appeal.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant because her authorization did not fall within the competence of the administrative court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for damages in the criminal proceedings.
“The public prosecutor's office and the district court should deal with such matters”, earlier explained to the PRR correspondent of the Tartu Court press secretary, Annette Creitsmann.
She said that Valvo Semilarski appealed the decision to the District Court, which did not change the decision of the Court of First Instance on 5 February.
It would now be for the State to say its word.
According to counsel Semilarski, the jury for the lawyer Oliver Nees, his client for about two years was unduly suspected of bribery.
It now requires the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to refute false allegations and to compensate him for his moral damage.
The complaints to the court were made by the Special Prosecutor ' s Office of the Launa District Prosecutor ' s Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semlarski, together with the second Vice Mayor, Tarta Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of having committed several crimes.
“Remember that when I was detained, the security police and the prosecution immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tarto, one of the most influential bodies of local self-government, were corrupt.
These public suspicions accompanied me for about two years.
Now that these allegations and suspicions have been false, the Public Prosecutor's Office has nothing to say,” commented Semlarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Neess, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the Public Prosecutor's Office should operate.
"The statement of bribes and sales has proved false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, had repeatedly stressed in its decisions on Russia and Lithuania that, during the investigation phase, State representatives should be careful to speak in the choice of words so that suspects would not be represented as criminals before sentencing.
The Prosecutor's Office is under an obligation to make the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately has not been respected in this case against Valvo Semlarski,” said Nees.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still found to be inadmissible, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair treatment of the complainant”, added counsel.
According to Rus.er.ee, the former Vice-Mer. Tarto Valvo Semilirski would not be prosecuted for charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is convicted of deliberately violating anti-corruption legislation in transactions of a particularly large size.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017 the former Vice-Mer. Tartu participated more than 30 times in city-level meetings in the decision-making process of companies operating in Tartu, whose owners or leaders had actively communicated at the personal level during the event.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semlarski had personal interests and was therefore required to refrain from taking part in the decision-making process.
Previously, according to rus.er.ee, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has accused Semlarska of receiving bribes and of violating anti-corruption legislation in a particularly large transaction.
This occurred in October 2016, when he was detained along with the other Deputy Mayor, Artem Sovorov (Centre party).
At that time, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both Vice Mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
The Suvorov case later went to the court, which fully justified the policy.
The investigation into the Valvo Semilirski case is still ongoing.

Give me back to my loyal Rookie Up fans, "We don't need a new baby."
Most of them do write directly that the original, which became a hit at the time, is more attractive to them.

How to impact the economy ' s decision to lower the key rate of CB
The Bank of Russia is expected to reduce the key once again.
It went down by a further 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25 per cent annual -- formally another historical minimum.
Based on the return of a short step towards lowering the rate, as well as the tone of CB statements and updated projections on the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy mitigation may soon stop.
“We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, especially given that inflation risks remain low from 4 per cent in 2021”, reported the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabyullin.
They are linked to a significant decline in economic activity, falling domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabyulin, will take over one and a half years.
She noted, however, that economic processes had recovered since the end of the pandemic: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand, increased construction and production of consumer goods, slowed the annual decline in freight traffic and production.
According to the updated projection of CB, in 2020 the economy will be reduced to 4.5.5 per cent (anticipated from 4 to 6 per cent) and the recovery of the economy to 3.5 to 4.5 per cent in 2021 and 2.5 to 3.5 per cent in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its annual oil price forecast to 38 and 40 dollars for Urals barrels in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
CB used to expect $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the projections of the Bank of Russia for inflation for 2020 were 3.7 to 4.2 per cent, against the previously anticipated 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation becomes more optimistic, which draws us closer to the end of the cycle of mitigation, considers economists in Russia and the CIS, the Renaissance Capital, Sophia Dont and Andre Melasenko.
For example, the Bank of Russia has consistently cut the key rate for more than a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has already dropped to 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last June meeting, the CB reduced it to one percentage point because of the low rate of inflation due to oppressive demand and the need to stimulate the dominant economy because of the pandemic and its associated constraints.
The pre-construction of monetary policy remains the same (at the next meeting on 18 September and before the end of the year), but the limit is close, and agrees by Chief Analyst Rosbank Evgenius Cochelev.
The aggregate of inflation risks also points to the proximity of the pause in mitigating interest policies - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to prevention measures and faster (as compared with expectations) recovery of demand, he said.
The Bank of Russia will need more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as to the external waltz that has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts.
In one way or another, the reduction of the key rate would result in a further reduction of the rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as perhaps mortgaged, says Max Petrenevic, a senior economist in the analytical office of the Open Bank.
The rate correction would be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarified.

Question: The ruling Union of peasants and Greens in Lithuania has again led the scores of parties
The Union of peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which leads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, led the scores of the parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by Vilmarus’s sociological research company, which ordered Leituvos rytas to order.

This statement has led to the disfavoration of conservatives.
The latest survey showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 per cent of voters would vote for peasants and 17.2 per cent for conservatives.
According to Director Villmorus Vladimirs Hadiths, the gap was within the limits of error, but the rulers did not give up on the conservatory.
In the opinion of Hadiz, the sociological success of the peasants contributed to the news that their electoral list would be led by Prime Minister Saulius Skwernis.
This politician was the first on the list of peasants and the 2016 election.
In third place, the Social Democratic Party was now ready to vote 7.1 per cent.
She suddenly lost 2 percent for a month.
The fourth is the Labour Party, headed by a businessman of Russian origin, Victor Uspassky (6.2 per cent).
Other political organizations, on the basis of a poll, are still unable to overcome the 5 per cent electoral barrier.

Excess claims for hotel purchases are excluded by law
The law may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session of the General Assembly, a draft law was to be considered in a second reading, setting out the requirements for the content and composition of the purchase application, to which only small and medium-sized enterprises could participate.
Amendments are made by the Government to the Law on Procurement of Goods, Works, Services of Certain Legal Persons.
The Bill is designed to implement the road map for the implementation of the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Strategy in the Russian Federation by 2030, approved by the Government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents which the employers have the right to require on the basis of a request from the procurement participants, small- and medium-sized enterprises.
As well as the list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the Procurement of Goods, Works and Services Act regulates the procurement of individual entities.
Requirements for the content, form, layout and composition of the purchase request shall be established by the customers themselves in the procurement documentation.
“The result is that there is an excessive requirement for the employers to have maintenance, the processing of an application, the mandatory availability of certificates, certificates, receipts that are comparable to the period of receipt of applications by the authorized authorities, which results in the inability to participate in such procurement and reduce the number of participants in procurement”, is explained in the explanation to the draft law.

“the acceptance of a document will result in the deletion of the arbitrary imposition by employers of requirements for the composition and content of requests by participants that are subjects of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship”, states the explanatory note.

Podmoskovier authorities have told of the fate of closed landfills
In Submoscow, solid household waste discharges continue to be closed.
This year the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfill sites are being upgraded to modern waste processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for each of the troops - many of them have grown into dense housing.
After the site is closed, it stands for reclamation - the body of the mine is crossing on the ground, and the gas-free system is mounted, and inflammation is removed.
This allows the chemical processes to stop within the landfill, so that it does not ignite, destroy, poison, soil and groundwater.
Then the former landfill will be lifted up to be a wasteful heap among the ills of its dwellings.
Why don't you do something useful about it?
For example, in Ruze, where the re-establishment of the Anino site literally ended in days, the authorities are considering a way to make a mountain slope out of a heap.
The site, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, grew to include land.
Therefore, the rescission had to purchase neighboring areas that had long since been hit by debris.
"Sometime it will go, the fire will roll," it will gain strength, and we'll think what can be done to make it useful.
It's right in the eyes of the mountain resort," the president of the Russian district, Nicolai Parfenov, told the journalists.
Two sites will become renewable energy sites
Trobeevo Plums in Lubersa and Temojo in Bogoroda District will be renewable energy fields from landfills and biological gases.
Torbeev will be launched by the end of the year by the end of the year by a gas station capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatts of electricity and about 0.95 heat-power gigacaloria, which will provide for its own needs: heating of administrative and production facilities.
Temohoho will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and continue to work as a waste processing unit.
And the Kuchino Plumbing site, which was closed after the residents' complaints on the Line of the President, could create a museum.
"It was such an idea to create a museum for reintegrating Podmoskoviya polytons," said the government's deputy, the Minister of Environment and Environmental Management of the Dmitri Kurakin.

Aya-Sofia was the only one who had the beauty of high-quality minerals.
Once again about Aya Sofia, the text came up about Vladimir Zelinsky, which, please, should be protested.
First of all, there's a free entrance.
I wasn't in Istanbul, but God's House is a free entrance, free of charge.
Secondly, Muslims have won this land as honestly as Orthodoxs have conquered the Volgo-Okreak, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God's help!
Jews conquered the Holy Land.
Americans conquered America.
Are we gonna get everybody back?
Do you think there are no pagans who will need to return their cellar, where the Tenth Church is located?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved the building, invested in it.
That is, they are like factories and places that Lenin had taken from the weeds into his property and owned by the Lenin and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything from Kremlin to Angar, so these are right-wing men.
The beautiful high-level minerals have really adorned Aya-Sofia, very much.
It was a stupid nun, it was a stupid nun with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “Islamic” and “orthodox” civilizations.
Some of the believers are hypocrites, and some of them are believers.
He who believes in the categories of civilization doesn't think.
It's the thinking of a British official, Da Toynbee, who believes in such a shame.
And he who believeth shall have a place of prayer.
And always.
He who believes does not pray except where he is asked to depart; he turns away and prays there.
He is a believer, not a advocate.
We're just blouses, not scurvy.
