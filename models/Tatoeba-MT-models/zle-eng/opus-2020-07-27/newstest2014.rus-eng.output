Two men committed suicide in Kineshma and the district
Earlier, one of the hangers had attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1-00, a man born in the village of Lugya, born in 1947, committed suicide by hanging.
He was known to have attempted suicide.
What moved a man like this is unknown.
On 31 October, from 11 to 50, a man of 41 years of age, Kineshma, died in his place of residence.
No sign of violent death has been found, reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kenya.
Is the black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair the scattered highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in the small black box that is well placed on your car's instrument panel.
These devices, which track and transmit this information to officials every mile passing vehicle, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the outdated American highway financing system adopted by the planned Washington State and Washington State authorities.
Usually, the boring road planway arena suddenly produced intense debate and colorful alliances.
Liberarians joined environmental groups in lobbying the Government to use small eggs to track the number of miles you have traveled, and possibly even where you are passing them, and then using that information in the compilation of tax accounts.
The tea movement is shocked.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues about private life.
Although Congress cannot yet agree on whether to continue or not, several states are not waiting.
They reflect on how during the next decade you can move on to the system in which drivers pay for each mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have satellite tracking functions.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the question on which we may have a choice,” said Hassan Ihrat, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, who is preparing plans to begin tracking the state of miles passing by each California motorist by 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
There are already technologies for that.
The need for this is exacerbated by the lack of funding from the Government ' s Highway Construction Fund, which is financed by taxes paid by Americans on auto-fuelling.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more than a mile per gallons.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallons, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don't even want to raise their taxes by one cent at high prices of gasoline.
“The tax on gasoline cannot be maintained”, said Lee Mannić, transport policy expert at Minnesota University.
In its state, 500 tracking devices have recently been installed in the vehicle in order to test the pay-as-you-go system.
“This will be the best long-term alternative”, he said.
They call it the wrong user card.
It is no wonder that this idea attracts urban liberals, since taxes can change the way you travel to reduce road traffic and emissions of greenhouse gases, for example.
The California planning bodies are looking at this system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the ambitious laws of the state against global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives, Bill Schuester (Republic, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the House ' s Transport Committee, said that he also viewed the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market participants at the Reason Foundation are also delighted to make drivers pay for each mile.
“It's not just a black hole tax,” said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Political Affairs Reason.
People are paying directly for what they're getting.
This movement is also supported by the two former U.S. Ministers of Transport, who in 2011 urged Congress to move towards a pay-as-you-go.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project in which about 10,000 vehicles participated.
However, the House of Representatives leaders rejected the proposal because of the concerns of rural legislators who often had to travel long hours in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is evident in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are invited to participate in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state a mile to run instead of the gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has been completed.
He's under review in New York City.
It will be tested on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And Coalition I-95, which includes transport departments of 17 Eastern Coast States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is looking at how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could monitor each step.
“The concern about a large brother and such things is a big problem,” said Alaudedin Khan, who is responsible for policy and performance management in the Department of Transport of Nevada.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were under way, the American Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to make these devices a full-scale tracking instrument”.
There is no need to build a huge, massive technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where difficult searchs for low-cost technology are being made to allow the state to account for the miles it has driven, but without information on the place and time.
If you can do that, said Han, society will feel more at ease.
This technology has led some state agencies to a small, California youth company called True Mailage.
Initially, the company did not cooperate in the state tax collection.
It sought to enter a growing car - type market, where drivers pay on the basis of the runway.
But the devices it tests attract road designers, because they don't use GPS, and they provide a limited amount of information that is periodically loaded with modem.
“People will be more inclined to do so if you do not keep track of their speed or monitor their location, ” said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There were a few big errors in some of these state-of-state pilot programs.
There are far less expensive and less binding ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with different options for drivers.
They may choose a device from or without GPS.
Or they may completely abandon the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all in the state travels.
In other places, the hope is to sell the idea to the public, making the devices do more than the minimum.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop a imposeable device that will also be used by parking counters, provide “payments on how you drive” insurance and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.
“Amobilists will participate in the benefit they are offered”, states the urban design document.
Some transport planners, however, are wondering whether all the talk of fraud is simply a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Gulf Urban Transport Commission, officials say that Congress could simply overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Railways by taxing gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be imposed on the drivers of hybrid cars and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is accept aspirin, ” said Randy Randshler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their own privacy and a multitude of other things.
EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in the event of Russian economic pressure
The European Union has a contingency plan for the provision of gas to Ukraine, as well as for an agreement with IMF on an urgent loan, if Russia is to take any action in response to the possible signing of a treaty of association between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF was in the process of negotiating a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations had added that their aim was to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential credit from IMF, Ukraine can get 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and IMF can overcome long-standing disagreements about the terms of funding.
He doesn't believe in the possibility of the reforms needed to obtain assistance and the international rating agency S&P, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating by one stage to B-B on Friday.
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in lending terms, taking into account Ukraine ' s circumstances.
In addition to the EU's financial support plan, the EU has a stand-by option to provide Ukraine with gas, which is now overwhelmingly being supplied from Russia.
This could be the airflow gas or the turnout from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way for Russia to "unify" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse transfers to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and is likely to reduce supplies to other regions.
“Each EU country and Ukrainians is engaged in negotiations on how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but from other routes”, added the source Reuters.
Russia outside of the pollution control of motor vehicles
Efforts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been taking place in most of the world’s megacities since the second half of the twentieth century.
It was generally either a restructuring and expansion of the highways or an attempt to reduce the demand for travel, the number of cars and the time they were used.
Singapore is a widely known example where strict quota of private car growth has been introduced and the right to purchase private vehicles is purchased by auctions.
Its price can be two or three times that of the car itself.
European cities, including London, paid for entry into the city centre.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart, there are so-called green zones where only cars with a defined ecoclass are allowed to enter, also using high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a “Five-year clean air plan” with a total value of about 250 billion Yuan (about $40 billion).
According to Beijing Lee Kunscheng, director of the Transport Pollution Control Division of Beijing City Environmental Protection Bureau, five years' goal is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 20 to 2017, increase in the number of private vehicles to no greater than 6 million (now 5.2 million), and increase by not more than 5% in fuel use per vehicle.
According to the agency, vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme include limiting the use of road transport and introducing additional taxes for owners.
Among other things, the urban “green five-year-old” measures include an accelerated transition to Euro fuel standards, a local system of vehicle standards and labelling and fuel, a restriction on the entry of vehicles into the city's centre, a ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (including the creation of incentive financial programmes to replace old vehicles for hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
The road innovation of Beijing also included a ban on all private vehicles within the fifth transport ring (all at the capital city of the PRC, six) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the registration plate of the vehicle), as well as the issuance of lottery-based registration plates (e.g. in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of authorizations for private vehicle registration in Beijing was only one third of 2010.
According to the current State Programme for Environmental Protection 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 it was 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, 2011 accounted for 41 per cent of all emissions of pollutants into urban environments.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times industrial and in St. Petersburg nine times.
In the Russian Federation, the possibility of restrictive car regulation on the streets of cities is still being considered.
The Director of the Institute of Transport and Transport Economics and Policy, WSH Mikhail Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures to suppress the demand for road travel are clearly unpopular and can only be taken by society if they are universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, with two clusters of highly sensitive vehicles, both service and personal, as well as “acquired” users, with a total of not less than 200,000 vehicles (about 5% of the total Moscow fleet).
A study was prepared by urban urban planners from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg on the balance of urban areas between housing, road surface area and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers were: the city centre was provided with two times as much roads as required, and most of the motorists living in the centre did not use cars every day, leaving them in the parking lot or on the streets for a long time.
As a result, it is proposed to build, not parking, a storage facility, rather than expand, a carriageway (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and accommodation of personal transport at the borders of the protected area of the historic centre (the total territory of some 3,212 ha, covering a number of central areas of the city).
fines for unauthorized street trade in water will increase
According to the urban authorities, an increase in fines would help to ensure order in Vedda and to free the streets of natural tents and ankles.
Most street traders do not pay their taxes, the products they carry out are often not subject to recognizable sanitation control.
This means that health is at risk.
Thus, the lower penalty for unauthorized trade for citizens will increase sixfold from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles from November, and report to the media service of the V with regard to water administration.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to the primary driver of fragile economic growth in Russia.
This is primarily a crisis of unpaid consumer credit and mass reductions in employees.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed but rather that it has a structure.
It's been fully attributable to consumption, which is almost non-altering,' stated the main Russian economist, Goldman Sachs, Clemens Graff, presenting yesterday's quarterly Investigator report on the Russian economy.
The nominal wage increase in Russia is now around 10%.
For 6% inflation, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at approximately current levels, expected in Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to optimize staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if the wages increase by 10 per cent, GDP is only 2 per cent, as explained by Mr. Graphe.
Companies have experienced a decrease in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to dismissal and rising unemployment.
Not to raise the wages of Russian business, comments Chief Economist Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pentüsin.
Unemployment near historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise their wages in order to lure or retain their current employees.
The demand for support in Russia is also receiving a very rapid increase in the need for accreditation.
In Mr. Grape ' s view, because of the very high rates of consumer borrowing, that type of lending did not have a multiplier effect on the economy.
"The benefits to the economy from increasing demand for lending are not seen, the money is not being spent on the economy, but returning to the same banks as interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is, in Goldman Sachs, they're looking for a little bit more time off for insatiable loans.
Most of them are taken by people who have nothing to offer in security.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not more likely to be returned," Mr. Gramer said.
The second threat of growth in Russia, therefore, is a possible crisis of unpaid credit.
The Director of the WCHE Banking Institute, Vasily Sweetkov, is already seeing signs of an impending banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the low-cost resources of public banks, were forced to attract the funds of the population at high interest rates.
In response the bankers went to the tropics of war and started lowering the interest rates, an economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot make loans at the same rates, or they will have a negative interest rate.
If the bankers do not give up, Russia faces a full - fledged bank crisis, says Vasilyy Sweetkov.
The exclusion of a number of banks' licences in recent weeks is seen by an economist as a predictor of mass collapse.
“The bankers themselves will not succeed: the contribution insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis”, warns the head of the institute.
But the increase in consumption would also slow down without a pay-as-you-go crisis, and believed in the Investorbank, owing to the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and military personnel in the current version of the budget.
In part, the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of natural monopolies tariffs (and consequently by the decline in inflation).
But only in part: if investments are not raised (and the prerequisite for this is not yet - see note), consumption growth will still slow down, confident in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pentüsin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The great risk is the still drop in oil prices," he said.
He estimated that Russia's economy would begin to decline at the price of oil below $90/barr.
The Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB has not yet been able to lower interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradox: inflation has fallen and banks have begun to raise stakes.
This could mean that they didn't believe the B.S. that they were turning to the marketing of inflation," said Clemens Graff.
The interest policy of the Central Bank on market rates does not affect, only the rates of interbank lending.
"For the CB, it's a disaster of all hopes," I appreciated Clemens Graff.
CB auction money is used by banks not for lending the economy but for managing their liquidity
Once the rate drops, the exchange rate changes immediately, it means that the funds are trying to go into speculation against the ruble.
“It will be clear to the CB that this strategy is not working”, said Mr. Count and recalled that the State is planning to put the ruble in “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But either you have to do it before, or you have to raise the key rate of the CB (5.5 per cent), he thinks.
He estimates that the rouble is now artificially overstated by 10%.
Only one way to drive is to get weak, and the expert's conclusion.
But if the CB leaves the finances with a doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the rouble mitigation policy, it could cause the ruble to collapse.
The second convention of the South Urala was held in Chelabinsk.
The Forum is scheduled for the Day of Popular Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The Congress was attended by delegations from all the cities and districts, representatives from national and cultural associations, religious faiths, the legislature and the executive, to a total of about 350 persons.
The forum ' s course is aimed at strengthening international harmony.
We can set an example here, not only in other regions, but also in other countries.
We have no differences and no differences.
We're living in a total sense," says Feofan, Mitropolitan Chelabinski and Zlatousticus.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the promotion of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
At the conclusion of the Congress, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theater.
An exhibition was opened by the Chelabinian National and Cultural Associations.
Snowden is ready to “cooperation” with Germany on US intelligence
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence detacher, stated that he was ready to go to Berlin to give a statement to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Kit Alexander, could not answer questions about his activities.
The German deputy Hans-Cristian Streebel met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snouden, who the deputy introduced to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my Government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that do not provide protection.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to reject criminal charges against him.
The charges against the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of public property.
Hans-Peter Fridrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, said to Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to do so.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense following allegations that NSA had listened to the chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who is chairing a parliamentary intelligence group, said that if there is an opportunity to hear Mr. Snouden as a witness, “without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States fully”, he should be used.
Mr. Strewebel, a parliamentary member of the Green German Party, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebel said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need to be assured that he would be there “in safety”, the deputy said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a “hard and constant” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
He said, however, that he was encouraged by the world's reaction to “his political remarks”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high - ranking officials — including in the United States — felt that the unsupervised system of comprehensive surveillance was useful to society.
The letter invites cooperation with the German authorities, “when the humanitarian situation is resolved”.
Frontline Airlines will charge the manual laying fee
Frontline Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for their hand-to-hand laying on board their flight.
Frontline Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand baggage and $2 for coffee or gas, although the announcement on Wednesday said that passengers would be able to keep their entire bank.
The new manual baggage fee covers bags in the upper baggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontline said it would cost $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travelers paid only when they were on board.
Frontier Kate O'Malley's representative said that $100 pay should make passengers take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for this, ” she said.
The airline began charging for the first and second bag in 2008 in the truck.
Passengers who try to avoid these charges get as much as they can, hand-loaded to the upper baggage compartments, which often lacks space in these compartments.
Cathedrals are one way to make passengers travel less on board.
O'Malley said that this new fee isn't really about making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier clients claim that finding a place in the upper baggage compartments is getting harder and harder.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline website should not pay.
This means that one passenger in the line of exit on Frontline can be able to deliver the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change in procedures on the web site and in Frontyer registrations was intended to ensure that passengers would know about the fee before they got to board.
The new manual Frontier fee does not start taking up until summer, although the date is not yet set.
Passengers often complain about luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage costs money, and passengers who need it should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, most of them did not deal with manual laying charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual fee three years ago, and another Allegit Air later followed her example.
The only other airline is Hungarian Wizz Air, said a airline consultant, Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the supplemental charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the manual fee was paid by Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Middlewest Airlines top manager, had recently flown by Spirit, and he was curious to find out what he would find on his landing when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit laying fee.
“The landing process was the smoothest one I saw in the airlines for my career, ” he said.
I expected to see a scrap of teeth and a fight when I got off.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing took place rapidly."
Frontline is also followed by Spirit for $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontline stated that passengers who received gas or juice could keep the entire bank and that the coffee supply would be provided free of charge.
She will continue to distribute water free of charge.
The US Airways tried to pay for the drink in 2008, but refused seven months after passengers started complaining and no other major airlines followed her example.
Frontline's manual graveming initiative, where passengers don't buy tickets directly from the airline, is its latest customer-rearing measure on its website.
The company pays for tickets online, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This has given all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than resort to a tourist online agency.
Frontline, however, went beyond everyone in this area.
In September, she began giving twice as much of the cheap miles as a often flying passenger to customers who had bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the face number of miles to 25 percent of the miles.
Thus, a 1,000 - mile [1,000 km] trip from Frontline, acquired from an online travel agency, would provide 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose a location in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontline website.
Frontline has a client base for loyal in her hometown of Denver, but her business is going down and down.
The revenue decreased by 9 per cent, and summer opportunities declined by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on the parent ' s back office by Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to correct Frontline's finances as part of the airline sales.
NSA blames "internal error" rather than hackers to stop the site
On Friday evening, the undercover National Security Agency stated that their site had been stopped for hours by a technical malfunction, not by hackers, as had been alleged on the Internet.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours this evening because of the internal error that occurred during the planned renewal”, reported the Intelligence Agency in an official electronic letter.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the disruption of the work was caused by a distributed attack of the type of “service failure” [DDoS] are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA site had not been working for at least six hours, and the site was still not available for some users.
The NSA previously informed ABC News that the internal secret network of the “not” agency had been hacked.
No classified information was in danger, according to the representative.
At least one online hacker activist group claimed that it was responsible for removing NSA from the site by using DDoS attack.
The DDS tests are designed to capture the target site with traffic while the servers are inundated and the site is not out.
Hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to enter the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the super secreted NSA, once called No such Agency, has, in recent months, been at the centre of public attention and severe criticisms following the departures of its extensive tracking programmes both abroad and within the country, all of which have responded to the secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by the disappointed former NSA official Edward Snouden.
The growing controversy around the agency has led to the perception that today ' s incident was the result of targeted hackers.
The Bombradier ' s arrival is declining as supplies fall and the number of orders per aircraft are ordered
The Bombradier Corporation, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday as a result of the reduced number of aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and the problem of contracts in its railway unit.
The Bombradier company in Montreal also did not publish any data on the flight tests of its new Cersey aircraft and provided new information on whether ambitious plans to introduce the aircraft into commercial operation would be implemented by next September.
After a first flight of an experimental model of an aircraft about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, raising questions as to whether the test stage was on schedule.
The results failed to meet the expectations and led to a fall of more than 8 per cent in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from “more than average” to “memorial” because of the belief that stock growth is limited in the coming quarter or two.
“In order to reduce the number of airlifts in general, we are certainly disappointed by the rate of return of the Transport Division, ” said Doerksen in the stock market survey.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for Cerseys as the summer test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical.
The Bombradier company hopes that the CSérees aircraft family will allow it to take a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first test sample of an aircraft was presented in March and took the first flight in September after several months of delay.
However, firm CSeries orders are not so much as 177 yet, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to verify company approvals of fuel efficiency and potential savings of the new liner.
There are now a total of 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director, Pierre Boduan, was confident that Bomboardier would reach its goal of 300 firm orders by the time the first plane was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward as planned.
“The aircraft's test model did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” said Bodowan at a telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software upgrades were planned for the flight.
All producers plan tests in different ways.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break on the update, so we did.
This will be the case throughout the summer test programme.
The second of the five test samples should take place in the coming weeks and all the others will follow it shortly, as reported by the company.
Nevertheless, analysts are sceptical about the claim that the first client will be able to begin operation of the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombradier stated that it would estimate the period of entry into service and provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow rate of summer tests - although apparently consistent with the Bombardier internal schedule - reinforces our view that the introduction will be carried over to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, ending on 30 September, the net income of Bamboardier fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted profit on stock remained the same — 9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly, from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
The analysts expected 10 cents on shares and gross income $4,56 billion, according to Thomas Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world ' s fourth largest aircraft producer reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, which was less than the previous year ' s figure of 57.
Total orders fell from 83 to 26 fixed-wing aircraft.
The portfolio of orders from the Aerospace Division was $32.9 billion by 30 September, without changing since 31 December.
“In the aviation field, results were consistent with our objectives, but few orders and common market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” said Bauduan.
Gross revenue from the aviation track fell 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
The world’s largest train manufacturer, Bombradier, reported that the gross income in this sector increased by nearly 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The freight of orders in the transport unit was $32.6 billion by 30 September, slightly higher than the figure of 31 December.
Problems with several major contracts have been adversely affected by the income of the transport unit.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombradier's shares, which also announced that the chief financial director of Google, Patrick Piedett, would be a member of the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent to the P-4.83 tenders in mid-four.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world’s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest Bobboardier competitor, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony is counting on a lower annual profit.
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, had completed the last quarter of a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast of profit for the current fiscal year.
The Sony results, from July to September 2013, were more gruesome than expected, owing to the decline in the demand for television, video cameras and personal computers of the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, in the second quarter, the company that brought in the first three years of operational profits of 5.2 billion yen, fell again in the reporting period to 9.3 billion yen loss.
The Japanese market for consumer electronics is going through difficult times, especially because of reduced demand for television.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, the Panasonic Corporation, has recently focused on industrial kits: the sale of the company is growing at a high pace, especially through road systems and clean technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year ending in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion operational profits against the expected 230 billion yen earlier.
However, according to Thomaston Reuters, analysts assumed that the figure would be much higher than 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the food line.
In the middle of this month, a sales of smart hours was announced from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashion functions that would free the demand 100 times a day from a pocket smartphone.
After Sony had reduced the annual income and export forecast, the company's shares in the Tokio toll openings lost more than 11 per cent in the price, down to 1668 yen per share in the morning.
Genius became the synapse stimulant.
Scientists at John Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School found proteins that allowed Foxp2 to perform its function to stimulate new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and the magazine’s summary is available on the website.
Gen. Foxp2 is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by finding a family of several people who could not speak correctly and sometimes even did not understand each other.
Scientists have found that the work of the gene Foxp2, but how it fulfils its function, remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their function is to create new synapses in the brain related to speech.
This is the result of another gene, SPX2.
The latter was detected as a result of the identification of factors that stimulate synapse education.
SSRPX2 has become one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, and Foxp2 is the only one behind it.
The fact that SSPX2 really affects the rotation has been confirmed by scientists in the experiment on muscle.
When animals had artificially reduced gene activity, they cried less when separated from their mother.
If the gene’s activity was restored, so did the frequency of the sound produced.
In the past, there was also a link to the excusing of Foxp2 itself.
Animals who were given a copy of the gene were more active and in lower frequency than normal mice.
However, scientists still do not know whether the work of Foxp2 is connected and, accordingly, controlled by SPX2 with the purely "mechanical" properties of sound or more subtle processes.
Cocaine lawyer who warned the head of the criminal gang of police investigations into prison
42-year-old Basharad Ditta transmitted information to the criminal authority of Neal Scarbor
Lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be solved.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
The press lawyer, who told the drug bank about a major police investigation because he feared that his secret drug addiction was exposed, had been imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditta sent classified information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough on his investigation of illicit drug trafficking activities after threatened by cocaine addiction.
A lawyer, who received Bash's nickname and who was summoned among the perpetrators by a “great lawyer”, was arrested at his home in 2011, following a police monitoring operation for Scarborough, which he had previously represented in a drug-related trial.
Officials noticed that the 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn County Lancashire while he was at dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Hett had “regularly used” class A drugs after the tests showed cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted to obtain unlawful information on the arrest of two persons on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were then under police surveillance as part of a major investigation into the activities of a criminal organization to sell heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambri, Merciside, Burkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and another 32 people were later imprisoned after the police had seized heroin and cocaine in a series of raids worth .1.5 million and more than 200,000 in cash.
In fact, a 42-year-old, Kitt, transmitted information to the criminals because of the fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditta, a law firm based in Blackburn, has been disgraced by two cases of deliberate interference with the administration of justice following the outcome of a three-week court in the Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted to possession of cocaine at an earlier trial.
The counsel was exposed after the police, following the investigation of Scarborough, found that he had regularly talked to Children on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and discovered how he got to the Dita's house in Blackburn and placed 60% of the drugs in a golf golf glove under a lawyer's garbage box.
Shortly after the handover of Scarborough, he met many times with Ditta, who was at a dinner party at the Ywood Park football stadium of Blackburn Roberts.
The lawyer returned home for drugs, with nine conversations.
The Court learned that Hett had “regularly used” cocaine after tests had found traces of a class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
The child was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, said he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client and insisted that their association was a “Avoka secret”.
At the time of his arrest, Kitt took his wallet and tried to extract some credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
During his interrogation, the police said that he had his home office in addition to his work place, and the clients came to his home on legal matters.
However, the court learned that, after important arrests, he had called the largest drug traffickers, a number of whom he had previously represented in court to tell them that detectives knew them.
In the indictment, Ann White said: "If anyone knows that a law should not be violated, it is a lawyer in criminal matters."
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer because he had become too close to certain customers.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly prove to be correct because he was their lawyer.
This, however, has largely crossed the boundaries of the legal and client relations.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible from allowing these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not hear his profession but disgraced it.
He got too close to certain customers, particularly Scarborough, and allowed him to question his interest.
The child did not confess guilt and said: “If I had been corrupt a lawyer to whom I am not, and I would like to convey information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it without delay.”
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Holstead of Lancashire Police stated: “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as he began to acquire drugs from organized crime representatives.”
His addiction to cocaine had rendered him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main participants of the criminal groups, who had entrusted him with obtaining valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire confidence and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Ditta's investigation led the Lancashire unit for particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already reached him with three cases of cocaine storage and now with a view to impeding justice by demonstrating our desire to achieve a just punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this be a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was convicted 14 years after his confession of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 persons participating in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
At his Dita website, he had a question and answer interview in which he said that his dreams were a lawyer representing death penalty clients in America, his ideal companion for dinner was Mohammed Ali, and his motivation for work was inequality.
The Jaroslava stadium was not ready for the reception of 22,000 spectators, and police officers were present at the meeting of the KDC to the RFF.
The ticket program is overstated, in their opinion, by about twice.
During match 1/16, the finals of the Russian Cup and Spartak were used by only a thousand flight attendants at a normal rate of 9,000.
The Spartacian fans placed 2,200 seats, or 10 per cent of the stadium capacity, but they were sold 5,000 tickets by agreement with the Moscow Club.
The data were read by Arthur Grigoriantz, head of KKR.
The Americans listened to the high officials of Japan
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the United States Special Service, who had chosen not to disclose his name, stated that the United States had listened to the phone calls of senior officials in Japan.
The man confirmed that there were several audit points in the country of the rising sun.
He noted, however, that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not carry out intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, had reported the NHK television channel, despite allied relations with Americans in the post-war period.
Officially, none of the parties have commented on this information.
Remember, the news of the United States Special Service surveillance at the FWG chancellor came up last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to listen to Merkel's phone for the past ten years.
The Chancellor himself, according to some data, received news of his wiretap in a painful way.
She stated that the allies she believed to be the FWG and the United States for decades were unacceptable, such as the supervision of the head of Government.
However, Edward Snowden stated that he was prepared to share details on the wiretap of Angela Merkel's telephone chats with the German prosecutor.
German made a special visit to Moscow to meet a former CIA officer.
Bacillery can produce grain at the tender no sooner than early 2014
Baciriums in the course of government procurement intervention may display grain at the tender not before the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Nicolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sale to the intervention fund.
So far the price on the market is higher, and there's demand.
"Maybe the grain will be put on the market after the New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that agricultural crop production in 2013 was 3.1 million ha this year, including the grain area of 1.7 million ha, an increase of 3.3 per cent over last year.
In 2014 there were 550,000 hectares (an increase of 105,000 hectares than in 2012).
The area under winter wheat and triticula has been enlarged, and the birth rate has remained at the previous level.
There is no group called "Brata Circle" in the CBM databases that Lepsa was assigned to in the United States.
In the databases of Russian militants, the "Bratcian Circle" group, which Washington listed as a singer, Gregory Leps, is not to be seen.
According to Interfax, all databases have been checked in the media after the reports of the U.S. Department of Finance, Gregory Leps, on suspicion of membership in the Eurasian criminal Syndicate “Bratsky Circle” have been reported in the press, but no such group has been found.
The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called “rusan mob”, which is allegedly operating abroad, is considered to be in power structures.
"Even in the name of 'Bratch', there's some element of mystery, there's hints on the secret bed.
"It's all very like a pyar-act," said the agency's interlocutor.
On 31 October, the U.S. Department of Finance announced the introduction of Arthur Badalian, Gregory Lepsweridze, Vadim Lälin, Sergei Moscalenko, James of the Ribal and Igor of Schlakov on his control lists.
Persons on the list are suspected of having links to non-Wladislav Leontiev and Hafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and who have been on U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Gregory Leps is “a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev”.
In the production centre of Gregory Leps, he refused to comment on the U.S. charges against the singer, calling them "fair."
In 2011, President Barack Obama of the United States placed the “Bratsk Circle” as“ substantial transnational organized criminal groups” and entrusted the minemine to “reserve and prohibit their global criminal operations”.
The blacklisting of a person on the U.S. Minphine list entails the freezing of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him among persons residing in the United States.
The scandalal video got to the police.
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and voracious journeys, fell on smoking cracks.
The Canadian city police stated that they had a video and were ready to start an investigation against the granolarian.
He said that he would not leave his post, reported CNN.
Information that the authorities had evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto Police site.
Bill Blair, head of local law enforcement agencies, held a press conference on this issue.
Cherif said he was not authorized to share the data with the public, but because of their existence he was engaged.
According to Blair, Rob Ford’s compromise video was detected during an anti-narcotic raid conducted by guards during the summer of 2013.
The existence of this video had previously been reported by the Canadian press, but no evidence had been received until recently.
The mayor himself does not comment on this.
He's just saying that he doesn't have anything to do with his retirement and he's not going to leave.
The video recorded by the police is one of the evidences in the case of Ford Alexander Lisi, a 35-year-old friend who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal revenue, and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lisa acted as the driver of Rob Ford.
The residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He fought journalists on several occasions, appeared in a drunken manner in the public, and allowed himself to be racist and sexist.
The "RosteroInvest" has recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of a tender for the site's artist's choice.
The amount of the contract at the RTA is not open.
According to the OAO press service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and the project should be prepared and sent to a public expert in spring 2014.
The winner has to design the new airport passenger terminal as well as infrastructure facilities, inland roads and airport improvement components.
In the first stage of construction, the internal terminal area will be 50,000 square metres, and it may further increase.
The design documents will take into account the prospects for the airport: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and, by 2035, 6 million passengers.
At the time of the outcome of the tender, the architectural concept of the “South” Aeronautics was developed by the British company Twelve Archives.
The design of the main terminal represents the idea of an air bridge between Rosovna-Donu and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beertan + Planen has experience in major projects, has designed terminals C and E of Sheremtevo International Airport and a new aero-ocean complex at Knevica International Airport in Vladivostok.
The southern International Airport complex will be built in the Axai region of the Rosov region and will replace the existing growth of the airport, which will be closed and will be integrated into the urban construction in the future.
The start of the project is scheduled to begin in 2014 and the introduction of all facilities is scheduled to take place in 2017.
A politician in Turkey announced a hunger strike against the wall on the Syrian border
In mid-October, the authorities began building the separation wall in the area of the town of Nusaybin in south-eastern Turkey.
The construction of the PMM by local residents and representatives of the Prakur Party was strongly opposed.
The mayor of the Syrian border of Nusabin Ayse Gekhan, a Turkish town, announced a hunger strike protest against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported to the RRA News in the Press Service of the Party for Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly raced protest demonstrations.
The Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mummer Güller, first refuted the construction and then stated that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"Mer Nusaibina Eishe Gekhan, a member of the PMD, declared a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," stated the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from each other, the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
“It's an inhumane situation with which Kurds will never accept”, quoted Aisha Gekhan as party representatives.
According to the press services, a meeting against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nosaibin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set exchange rates for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange course for its national Bolivian currency in relation to the tourist dollar.
This was reported on 1 November by Bloomberg, referring to a government decree.
Foreign travellers will allow one year to exchange amounts equivalent to 10,000 United States dollars.
Venezuela would also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the country ' s obtained Bolizers at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the Bolaire against the dollar will be determined at a later date.
In February, Caracas had to demolish the local currency to 6.3 Bolaires per dollar.
On the black market, however, one dollar is estimated to be 57 Bolivers.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost nearly 70 percent of its value.
Inflation in Venezuela amounted to almost 50 per cent in September.
On 18 October, the Minister of the Petroleum Industry and Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramírez, stated that Venezuela had no plans to devaluation the bolivar.
According to the informal information that led to the agency, Caracas could still reduce the rate of national currency after the December elections.
The policy of curbing the prices of products and consumer goods, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, had led to a lack of a number of products and the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that Venezuela had seen a shortage of toilet paper.
The South Director, Andrey Belmach, said that it was difficult to say how long it took to find a new master trainer.
This post became vacant following the resignation of Sergey Shepelev.
It just happened a few hours ago, so just to tell me how long it takes to find a new coach, I'm not ready, brings up the words of Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking at all the possibilities.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
Not just wanting to find a coach, but a man who's been working at our club for a few years and will get some results with it.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” said the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamaou, executive director of the Capital Group, a parent company, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new media judicial body “will always be biased, as it is a continuation of the Government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would affect Kenya's situation in the global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would in fact enable the Government to “receive the media as dead,” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya “has been seriously hit” and criticized as a “draconsky” bill.
The adoption of the draft law is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack of Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Center.
The Kenyan media have provoked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras where the troops who were sent to the scene of the attack are expected to rob the expensive shopping centre.
The response of the Chief of Police, David Kimayo, to two journalists and a media officer for questioning, although the challenge was lifted after mass media protests.
Under the new legislation, publishing could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, while individual journalists could be subject to an additional risk of being “exclusive”, i.e. a ban on official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the assets of the violator if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “only one fine is enough to paralyse the work of most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called “living blogosphere” of Kenya.
Politicians realize that when they silence the media, they can do everything they can to them with impunity.
“ Nobody will ever know, ” wrote National Journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of deterrents and balance in public life.
“Peculiar politicians will destroy the country and return us to hunting and gathering, ” he wrote.
Kenya’s legislators were the target of social anger in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of abolishing the cuts imposed by the National Wage Commission and restoring their huge salary of about 53,000 shillings per month, not subject to taxes, one of the highest in the world.
Community payments will result in a new period of expenditure, such as a contribution to major repairs to the home.
The most approximate estimate for a standard two-room apartment would be to pay between 100 and 400 roubles per month from the new year.
The Government of the region will determine the precise standards.
But once you color the steps, bring the ladder cells in order, or even replace the elevator, the tenants will decide.
This law has been approved by the deputies of the Regional Duma.
Vladimir K. K. C., Chairman of the Voronze Regional Duma, said: “In this case too, it is necessary to order the cap-up of the houses, to accumulate funds from non-administered companies - which we often register in Moscow, and in Orenburg, and elsewhere, it will establish State control over the spending of funds that residents collect for the repair of multi-family buildings.”
State-controlled building now is also sustainable.
The law protecting the fraudsters has been approved by a final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, some 4,500 people have been affected by dishonest planners.
Most of the problems have been solved.
The new law, by the way, recognizes the rights and obligations of all participants in equity construction.
Vladimir Kindernikov, Chairman of the Voronze Regional Duma, said, "It's no secret that there were also abuses in this area, owing to the fact that in the 98s there were the same dealers, and in the 2000's, the same cutters.
People started making money to cover the loophole, including the adoption of these two laws.
It was decided to build a temporary stay centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation.
The State Parliament has adopted such legislation not only under the pressure of the Federation.
The problems of irregular migrants in the region should be even reduced.
Thus, during the past year, only over 100,000 foreigners have been registered.
But only one in five has formalized a work permit.
Where the others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Korynikov, Chairman of the Voronze Regional Duma, said, "They have violated the law, but are not criminals."
There's no court, and there's a way to deport them, and they're meant to be kept somewhere.
This decision was taken by the Federation that regional funds would make it possible to establish such sites.
In the Vorones region, this place is defined as Old Olshanka of the Sililuk district.
Well, in the end, the Regional Parliament has granted new benefits to parents of many children.
First, families with 5 or more children are totally exempt from transport taxes.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million -- but it also saves a large number of parents.
Secondly, and most importantly, those who adopt 3rds and younger ones will be given housing grants from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square metres at a cost of 30,000 feet.
A family of six, for example, is a dad, a mother, a mother's child, and a 3rd person.
For them, according to the standards, the State has an area of 108 square metres, a total of 3 million roubles.
For the left bank or south-west neighbourhood, it is quite acceptable.
Well, a whole cottage can be bought in a paradise center for that money.
Baumgertner nominated to the Council of Directors of Uralcalia.
The current Board of Directors of the OA, Uralkali, has proposed the name of the arrester of Vladislav Baumgertner, who was arrested in Minsk, to be a new board member, on the website of the Russian company.
Bamgertner was on the list of 11 people who had been nominated for the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for the extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, which will identify the new board of directors by voting.
Currently, Baumgertner is under house arrest in Minsk.
In August of this year, he was charged with abuse of official powers.
However, later Belarus's President, Alexander Lukashenka, at a press conference, stated that the charges against Baumgertner were reclassified as “intrition”.
Matt Dalton's "Nephthemist" entry refused to comment on Vladimir Crykunov's departure from his lower-crowd mentor.
Holkerer believes that the Acting Chief Coach, Domitre Balmin, has a great authority in the players and will handle his duties.
Remember, today Nathechemik retired Krykunov.
To be honest, I don't want to comment on Vladimir Krykowov's dismissal, quote Dalton RIA News.

U.S. Secretary of State: Services have sometimes come too far for data collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that in collecting data and wires, American intelligence services sometimes "went too far", however, the politician noted that the media's information about the wire of 70 million people was not accurate.
I assure you that innocent people have not been hurt in this process, but an attempt to gather information has been made.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was unjust.
I recognize this, as the President recognizes... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future,” quotes Secretary of State AFP.
Italian and senior workers are losing the way to the young
Italian unemployment is keeping record.
On Wednesday, data showed that 12.5 per cent of the population were now unemployed.
So bad things have not survived since the Second World War.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15-24 years are unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one solution is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an operation is already being carried out by the country ' s largest energy company, and legislation adopted enables regional authorities to provide part of their early retirement pension for workers.
On the other hand, Italy, on the other hand, is expecting a common European problem for the ageing population.
And economists are not sure that the premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
The construction of the TKS in Moscow will lead
Every year, the capital authorities promise to construct more and more transport and transplant units (VEOs).
It is planned to introduce a total of 255 TPK into section 220.
Our correspondents handled the project as a matter of fact.
A couple of months ago, a building fence was set up at the Smolen Metro of Arbatsko-Poply Line.
The post said that it was setting up a transport transplant room.
All of this was very strange, as no land transport was stopped near Smolinsk and therefore cannot be moved.
To reach the nearest Trolleybus stop at the Garden ring, we need to cross some 130 metres, including the land crossing through the Carmanica alley.
It's almost over at the Molensky now.
The flowering unit had disappeared, the newspaper stand had been dismantled, and the asphalt had been replaced by a brunette before entering.
There's the whole transport knot.
Transport hubs are flat and capital, as explained in the press service of the capital Department of Transport.
There are no capital TPKs yet.
The flats include parking, the removal of commercial facilities that prevent the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural structures, and the improvement of the environment.
In fact, the TPK is not even run by transporters, but by professional evangelizers from the Department of Capital Mastering of the City of Moscow.
Transport node is not necessarily a complex design, explains the Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of Michael Blinkin, High School of Economics.
Sometimes it is enough to cover the head and panel to announce the time of the arrival of the transport.
So, for example, on the Yasenevo subway, a very full flat transplant node was recently opened.
Let them not wear a burden, but let them have interceptions and signs that indicate when the bus comes.
But in the pursuit of the number of officials, they're writing down everything in the TKS.
As early as 2011, the mayor planned to build a total of 151 knots, 59 of them with a capital building.
Plans up to 2020 are now as good as 255 URPs.
Of these, one and a half promise to surrender this year.
While there is a programme for the development of the TPK, no qualitative criteria have been identified, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the organization Cities and Transport.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of transplants in each is often deteriorating.
The criteria, in the expert ' s opinion, should be two: first, to reduce transplant time, and secondly to convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without going into the rain.
In Moscow, the TPK sometimes turns out exactly the opposite.
A vivid example of the WDH subway.
Previously, the train buses with Jaroslav highways had entered the square ahead of the main entrance to the VIC.
Now their stopovers were moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka on the street of Cosmonauts.
Far from the subway, far further away from the monoreel, but closer to the residential houses.
For a long time, the residents never wanted a car windowroom and complained to all the possible authorities.
There's no way that you didn't play with the capital TEC in Moscow.
The first of these began to be built five years ago on the Pennerne subway.
The draft was intended to be exemplary.
And it really got a sample of how the transplant node given to investors turned into a canal shopping mall.
No, it's got bus featheres, suspensions to stay out of the subway in the rain, and three floors of the parking lot.
True, the Chimkin Trolleybus No. 202 and No. 203 of Moscow TPK did not give space in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway as strangers.
But there's more to trade.
The only clothing available is 32 shops, and almost everything comes from zoos to autosalon.
Well, what if someone from the bus passenger had to buy a new car?
We have, when the capital TPK is built, why is there always a shopping mall?
Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion when some parking stations have decided to market.
Now, on the third floor of TPU, Planerna, there is a high trade among the floor parking spaces.
The shoes, the spices, the Chinese jeans, the neurish speech and the guards who look viciously at our photographer.
The transplant facility was finally turned into a market.
The thing is, earlier on the Pennerne subway, there was a market but it was destroyed.
And in the prefecture, traders were pityed and thrown into the parking lot of the transplant room.
Even so, due to high prices, it is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market has been cut down to build in its place... a new flat turf.
That's the story.
On the Colosseum subway, the approach from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 meters, and relates Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of a shopping mall, allegedly by TPU, the distance increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, we need to cross the shopping mall.
After 22 hours of closure, it has to be covered in the open sky.
But the design on Plannerna and Klukowska will soon appear in flowers.
In mid-September, the City and Land Commission of the Mayor approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TIC.
Four of them will be 25-story, not counting two-three underground layers.
The main monster is going to grow in the Tusino subway, which will have 418.7 thousand square metres of area.
Representatives of the railway station administration responsible for the construction of the TPK on the subway have already told journalists: stores, hotels and apartments are being broken down in the future.
At the same time, officials believe that multiple parking fleets will take from one third to one half of the area.
Let's take the example of a "people" garage.
Let's say the 258 car garage recently built on the International Street has an area of ,015 square metres.
So, for parking of 2,600 cars at Petrovo-Romamovsky, you're going to need about 80,000 quadratics.
That's less than a third of the stuff that's going to be built there.
I want one or two floors on every bus pen.
At least 150,000 square metres of commercial property remains.
This is almost two GUMs for a minute.
If the capital TPKs are built by railway stations and railway stations, the rest of the areas will be mined by the Metropolitan people.
They also promised that there would be many “functional facilities”, including hotels, offices and even gymnastics.
In fact, the Moscow City Property Department has recently reported to journalists that it is a draft regulation that will enable investors to apply for a TPK site for officials directly.
No competition.
Because, please, transportation is a priority for the city.
The ideal TIC is, for example, Garvard's in Boston or the West station in Toronto, and I'm sure Alexander Morozov.
Trolleybuses and trams descend beneath the ground to the metro level and the distance from the subway wagon to the tram is only 50 metres without going out.
No more trade around.
But Moscow officials are so extreme.
Either we can't build anything, or we'll hit 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to equate extremism with the insults of patriotic feelings
In order to provide legislative protection for the patriotic feelings of citizens against the provocations and insults against Russia, “Justy Russia” proposes that the insult of patriotic feelings should be equated with extremist activity and punished for this for five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvetia, such legislative amendments to the law prepared by Oleg Mikhevov's General Energy Committee are already being sent to the Supreme Court and the Government to obtain an opinion.
Under the patriotic feelings of the citizen, the author of the amendment proposes to understand the emotional connection of the individual with the country of which he is a national, characterized by love and respect for the country responsible for its fate, history and culture.
According to Mikhev, there are sanctions in domestic legislation for the abuse of formal forms of State power, the flag and the hero.
However, in the view of the parliamentarians, the protection of Russians whose feelings can be hurt and insults of State symbols and other manifestations of contempt towards our country are not sufficiently developed in Russian law.
He cited as an example the annual eve of the Day of Victory, in which some media rings allowed themselves to question the heroic behaviour of the people of the USSR in the fight against the Fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday - Victory Day on 9 May - a real vacation is launched every year.
By exercising obscenity and “alternative” view of history, some publicists have come to the conclusion that it is a pity for the cultural Germans to win the wild Soviet Union!
I think it's totally unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the primary “spiritually established nation” -- the Oleg Mikheev is outraged.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriotically inclined people in Russia are far more than religious people, but law does punish insults to the feelings of believers, and it is possible to insult patriotic feelings with almost impunity.
According to the popular electorate, it is necessary to equate the insults of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to describe the punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The draft provides for penalties for the offence of patriotic feelings, ranging from a fine of 100 to a fine of five years.
The magnitude earthquake occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the area of Kokibo in central Chile, transmitted by Reuters.
The earthquake lay in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometres and at a distance of 54 kilometres south-west of the city, as explained on the USS Geological Survey site (USGS).
The tapes were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 1 November to Moscow).
Victims or underground destruction has not yet been reported.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most earthquake-active areas of the Earth, so it is not rare.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
At that time, the magnetic earthquake of 8.8 and the tsunami they caused resulted in the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile had the most powerful earthquake in its recent history, with a magnet record of 9.5 registered in 1960.
That disaster killed more than 5,000 people.
Domitry Medvedev: the Greenpeze case will be dealt with fairly
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Demetry Medvedev, on Friday, advised that the Greenpeze case would be considered in strict compliance with Russian law.
France can be certain that the case will be heard in accordance with the law.
"We can guarantee that the laws are followed," said Demetrius Medvedev at a meeting with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detainees of Greenpeze are a French citizen.
Pierre Pizanne, like other activists, is charged with hooliganism.
“I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen”, quoted Mr. Ero's REA News.
“Our country cannot support activities that could harm the environment, no one can violate the laws,” stated Dmitri Medvedev in turn.
He said that the activities of any entity that sought to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy extraction, were dangerous.
He emphasized that these objects were “like a powder barrel” and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, and handed over to the "Novosta RA".
UN announces new targets for overcoming poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin to work on a new set of Millennium Development Goals, formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty throughout the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable Development Goals” to replace the MDGs, which were due to expire in 2015, to the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which had begun in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
These were included in the outcome document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, said the night before the summit that it was time to “stand above national interests”.
“I am glad that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and oversee the process of achieving the universal goals of sustainable development — the CSD,” he said.
These CSDs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will spare no effort to use the authority given to me by the member countries to translate our vision of sustainable development, which is based on the success of the MDGs.
Concerns about security in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Through the top-down statues of Zamora Machel, the founding President of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to scan the slogans for peace on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want to restore peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she replaced a business suit for a T-shirt decorated with a “We Require Security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital area of Independence.
In two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between Government forces and Renamo were one of the most violent clashes since the Truce was held more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once known as the rebel movement, which was initially supported by the White authorities in Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country ' s independent Government.
Following the 1992 Truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to rebound into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
High rates for fast-growing economies, since the discovery of large-scale shelf gas reserves and coal fields in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tino, Valle of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party leading the political power since 1975, and Renamo party are accused of each other of the tensions that have arisen.
Renamo Party claims that the Government was the instigator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala Province, the Renamo tradition of 17 October.
The attacks against the former rebels were then aggravated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlacama, the leader of the group, and reported to the newspaper Financial Times Fernando Mazango, representative of Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armand Gebus tried to dispel fears of instability.
Hebusa said to AFP, to the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dkhlacama felt like a "drooper" who wanted to use “all that he had left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, there were concerns that Mazanga had announced Renamo ' s rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the Frelimo Party agreement.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but seriously”, said Mazang.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tension that has intensified the series of clashes this year.
“These are two powerful men (Hebusa and Dchlam) who have been faced with foreheads, ” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University, and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections appointed for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by a weakened movement to win concessions and financial bonuss from the Government.
The proportion of votes in favour of Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve in those elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebusa, who was to retire next year, when his second term ended, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want a multiparty democracy; he doesn't want transparent elections; he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency,” Mazang said.
It is not clear what Renamo is capable of, but it has already launched destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the encounters took place in Sofala Province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beiro, the port that mining companies, including Rio Tento and Valle, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was turned down when he was asked if Renague would repeat that threat.
The Renamo Party wanted “to warn the international community that Mozambique is not doing very well”, said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the Government ' s frustration, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent Media Company of Mediaoop.
“People think that the future of the country lies with the Government and with the President, who must find a solution to those problems”, he said.
Omar Sultuan, the demolisher, said that people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to resume peace, they want free access to the roads, ” he said.
A series of "Art Mainström" press shows will take place in Moscow
A series of At-Mainstrem films, where the viewers will see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they are released, will be held at the "Rolan" cinema from 1 to 5 November, with reference to the project organizers.
The Athle Mainström program will be opened by the French director's comedy and actresses Reim Kerici's "Pare at Any Price".
This is a story of the Maye model (Masa Keric) working in the French capital, which is deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to the film by Kerici, the spectators will also be presented with a new painting by the famous South Korean film director Kim Ki-Doek, "Mibius", a medramatic biographer by Oliver Hirsbígle "Diana: The History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts as the main role and the main film by the Cann Film Festival of Life of Abdel-Keshish.
The only Russian participant in "Athle-Mainstrom" will be the winner of the film by Alexander Veldinsky's "Heliograph Globe" on the basis of Alexey Ivanov's one-named novel.
The main role is the charming failure of Victor Servicekin, who played the film by Constantine Habinsky, whose work was also marked by the prize of Kinotauvá.
Children should study myths and legends as “models of the way of life”, says the author.
The story of the Torah could show that “a grotesque power cannot overcome a subtle trick,” while legends about King Arthur demonstrate the importance of having a dream.
Many myths are said to be “so wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too indecent to teach in schools”, Crossley-Holland favours “smart selection” of texts that are age-appropriate.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education, ” he said.
I was in favour of introducing them into the 20-year-old curriculum.
He added that the “extreme moralism” of authors and teachers was “extremely of interest” among children and that the main ideas were“consolidated” in exciting history.
Crossley-Hollland, who translated Beavolf from Anglo-Saxon, also wrote the Norwegian Myth Collection for Penguin and the British People's Tales, said: “You may, of course, have intentions, but you should be able to keep them with you.”
Perhaps a great distinction between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or brought to a happy end, but that there should be a congenital understanding of right and wrong.
And it should be sublimated; it's revealed through history, not clearly defined.
Old principle: show, not tell.
In Voronze district, a football fan was detained, breaking a window in the waiting room of the station.
At the Ghryzi-Vorneja station at nine o'clock on 29 October, the transport police withdrew two football fans from a passenger train from the village of Moscow.
When they went to a game of their favorite team, they set up a drunk debut on a train.
Young people were taken to the duty station of the Police Line Station at the Ghryzi station to prepare an administrative offence report.
There fans repented of their antisocial behaviour.
The police formed administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and waited for his arrival at the station station.
In the middle of the first night, the fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly came back and hit the front door in the waiting room with a window.
A transport police officer and a RHZ PKP were engaged at the bell of the broken glass.
They were able to arrest a criminal who tried to escape the scene.
The employees of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs are subject to inspection.
A question is being raised regarding the initiation of criminal proceedings, and the senior recipient of the communication of information and public relations of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the transport of Sergey Olkhik.
Vitaly Mutko: Water?
I think we're 15 years back.
The Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, gave his opinion on the riots in the rostrum during the Russian Cup's "Spartacus"- "Spartacus".
I'm in favour of organizing sports events: clubs, leagues, RFs.
But we see that they've taken a bad stand.
They're waiting for someone from the side to come and get order.
That's a very good position, but it's not the right position.
We need to organize the fans, and the clubs should invite their flight attendants, not take the job on their own.
We have now drafted a special government regulation on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it has been accepted, we will deal with this problem in a comprehensive manner.
But I'm still going to have to invite all those who host the football process.
I've read Leonida Feduna's interview.
State, please, let's move the law.
It's a feeling they're Bavary fans in Yaroslavl and they put it all together.
We are outside observers.
In fact, it's horrible to see the porcupine watered with brandy.
And it's in a country that's preparing for the championship of peace.
"I feel like we're back 10-15 years ago," Mutko said.
Snoudna can be interrogated in Russia
Edward Snowden, an ex-worker of the United States Special Forces, is not likely to leave Russia to give evidence of the wire loophole of Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the United States can answer questions from the German gender department in writing or in an eye in Russia.
Edward Snouden's exit outside Russia is practically excluded.
"In that case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by the U.S. Allied countries," said the agency's interlocutor.
“It would be appropriate to refer representatives to the FIU or to refer written questions to Snouden in principle”, added the source adding that this issue should be addressed at the inter-State level.
Formerly, German Bundestag Hans-Cristian Strebel reported that Edward Snouden was ready to testify in the case of wires conducted by United States special services negotiators to the Chancellor of Germany.
Snouden is ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in German territory.
The CIA ex-worker made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although USSA blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to return to Germany.
"But to do that, you need to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival," said Strebel, Euronews.
Snouden Anatoly Kucheren's lawyer, commenting on the source's statement, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how it would decide on itself.
A United States citizen, Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, followed by a public report on the U.S. surveillance operations on the Internet.
Snouden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been revoked by the U.S. authorities, which had seriously charged him, and had remained in the transit zone of Cheremetevo until early August.
On August 1, Snouden received a temporary asylum certificate in Russia for a year and left Sheremetiev on the same day.
Yesterday, American attorney Anatoly Kucheren said that his client went to work in a big Russian company.
The NSA surveillance of Angel Merkel last week was reported to the German media.
According to journalists, the chancellor's telephone calls began to be heard in 2002.
The surveillance station was allegedly located at the US Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after publishing these information, stated that Merkel's surveillance violated German law and sovereignty.
Pnomavèv left Fair Russia.
A member of the State Duma from the “Justy Russia” party in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomov, filed an application for withdrawal from a political organization.
As the parliamentarian stated, he submitted a statement to the New Sibir regional office of the party.
According to her statute, this automatically means that Ponomari has left the ranks of “prospirosis”.
We're sitting here drinking tea.
"It's why many people want to see the painting "Ilia Ponomarive puts on the table of the partilet," but there's nothing of a time when he commented on his decision.
Ponomyvre noted that she had a good relationship with the regional office of “constrainers”.
However, Ilya Ponomárev, a member of the State Committee, has no intention of abandoning his mandate.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the faction and was legally unable to leave it.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the Just Russia came on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Goodkov and Valery Zubov would join him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese M.D. Fumio Kisid, met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“The people would have had a frank exchange of views on the further development of political dialogue, the debate about the conclusion of a peace treaty”, stated at the Kisid meeting.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that, since the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, had visited Russia, relations between countries had become more warm and had become bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation would meet Japan on complex political issues, writing to RRA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the disputed Northern Territories.
Therefore, there are now protests in Tokyo demanding that the lost land be returned to the country after the Second World War.
In the Japanese capital, cars travel through the loudspeaker, saying, "Vernit the Northern Territories."
The police do not stop the protestors, they make sure that the noise levels are not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: New York
We can boldly say that New York is the birthplace of the American flukes: almost a hundred years ago, a staged artist, Frank Fee, who worked at the Palace Theatre Theater in Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Fea's innovation has been caught over time by others -- more recently, the New York comedy festival.
The created and run by Caroline Hersh, founder of the Caroline Club, is celebrating this year's tenth anniversary with more than 60 shows in small clubs and big theaters.
"The majority of these soweds started at Carolines and then got better, reached a level when they're too famous to perform at a club," Hersch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes presentations by Wanda Sykes, Katy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the Stendap for Heroes, an annual music and music charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springstein, John Stuart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will appear among the others.
As the festival grew, so did the comedy's world.
A few comedys participating in the festival this year have become popular in a non-traditional way, for example by means of small TV shows, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll is famous for his role in the comedy show on a low-known cable TV channel (the Liga strip on FXX is now running his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slatt has joined the actor in both "Study Night on Live Night" and "Parka and Rest Zones", although most of its knowledge of the series of virus-infected "Marsel Cancer in Boots."
Both Kroll and Slat, like other young self - employed comedys, are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a fluke, but then became a successful director on television and in movies, as well as an informal comedy story.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the lead show on the TV Land called the Set Down Company with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in the Tower Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This town is, of course, the central element of Larry’s entire work, ” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he's coming here, he sometimes walks around a piece between the two houses and thinks, "If I stay completely without money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistan authorities have initiated negotiations with the local Taliban
Pakistan authorities have initiated negotiations with the Taliban.
The Embassy of that country reported on the situation in Britain, where Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, was visiting.
The Head of Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with the Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice-President Nick Klegga, with whom he discussed Pakistan ' s and India ' s relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
The Prime Minister stated that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun, as stated in the statement of the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed for dialogue to work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan,” added diplomats.
Pakistan ' s Taliban (Techk-Taliq-Taliban) are allies of a single Afghan movement, but they operate independently in the north-west of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistan's Taliban are seeking to establish an Islamic State.
The Islamabad Government had previously attempted to enter into negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to dialogue.
It stated that it would not be possible to negotiate unless the authorities took to permanent locations troops stationed in the Taliban and released from prisons of arrested Islamists.
Nawas Sharif arrived at the World Islamic Economic Forum in London.
On Tuesday, 29 October, the Prime Minister of Britain, David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani Government and the Afghan President Hamid Karzai, held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
The oil fell in the price to $96 per barrel.
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, when concerns over large reserves were overshadowed by a report indicating that China ' s energy sector gained strength.
The US crude oil supply in December was 14 cents cheap and the price was $96.24 per barrel at a later European time in electronic commerce at the New York Trade Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract cost 39 cents, a 5.8 per cent drop in the October price.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels over the last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports of the Chinese industry that had increased its activity.
This indicates that China ' s economic recovery can continue to gain strength after the third quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 per cent after a 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
The Brent oil, also used by U.S. refineries, has been cheaper by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the intercontinental exchange in London.
The chief Colorado coach, Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release Simeon Warlam from the first minute on Friday's match with Dollas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars had not shaken his confidence in the Russian, transmitting from Dallas the sower of the "SE" Natalie Schmelel.
So what do we have to wait,” Rua said after the dawn of Lavin.
Of course, what we've all done is bothering ourselves, but we're confident in it and feel it'll be good for him to go to the ice tonight.
We want him to get out on the ice and show him his regularity.
So you're pretty sure the situation didn't have any effect on the tours?
I'll see you today.
We will no doubt support Varley's players by helping him to guard the gate, as was the case in the previous match of the season.
Most importantly, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until the court decides on the situation.
In Siberia, there's no need to be vegan: a warm tomato won't replace the soup.
Because vegetarianism does not fit for life in Siberia, the correspondent of RA News discovered.
People who have totally abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they cannot carry the winter without losing their health, and no warm tomatoes can compensate them, says New Siberian diethologists and doctors of New York City’s Eve’s Day.
Drinking literal butter
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish but also milk, honey, eggs, and fashionable life - styles.
However, Dyethologists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, strict food standards are at least not healthy.
The total elimination of animal products is harmful.
Proteins contain irreplaceable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for with vegetation.
You must necessarily include at least milk or eggs in the diet," confident nutritionist Marina Godi.
It cites fish containing irreplaceable Omega-3 fat.
Their richest vegetable oil is linen.
"He needs to drink a litre for a human to eat," says a nutritionist.
The medical community is confident that special attention should be given to the diet in Siberia.
Vegetarianism is especially called into question during this season.
In our reality, food demands are high.
To keep cold, you need high calories.
"If a person limits himself on animal products, he does not like this calorie," says the specialist.
This is the agreement of the doctor, Og of Austeak.
She adds that the vegetables and fruits brought in are not the way out.
It is better for a person to eat mainly from food grown in the region of residence or where it was born.
Genetic code is designed to improve the absorption and digestion of these products.
And the winter people don't want to play hot, hot soup or anything else,' says the doctor.
She said that from what may be vegans, various grains, grains, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries were really useful.
But that certainly is not enough to be fully nourished.
According to the Gastrogenterologist Claudia Arifulina, there is only enough vitamin levels for Siberians from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural environment, where temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May it is not appropriate.
Organization for life needs energy, and that's fat, first of all," states the medical staff.
Doctors note that venerealism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant people.
Children are growing up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And in keeping with vegetarianism, we give them incomplete value.
Those treated also need increased content of protein, vitamins and micronutrients in the menus.
"The vats miss them," I'm sure God.
Arifulina says an adult is free to choose anything, "to play the toys he wants."
It has already developed an organism, skeleton, organs.
And yet the children have to eat completely.
If his parents deprive him of any micronutrients or amino acids, choosing what he will eat for him, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"A lack of substance to develop the brain, the eye, and the bones tomorrow will not be restored," she says.
All medical professionals interviewed agree on the low quality of winter growing in greenhouses and vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains fewer micronutrients that we need than the ones that are high on the ground.
"The quality of the products is not that," says God.
Arifulin also notes that the vegetables and vegetables that are brought and warm are far removed from perfect standards.
Sometimes the producer’s desire to produce a larger crop is harmful to quality.
"The apples don't grow brown on the cut, the cucumbers are quickly yellow and fertilized, the tomatoes are delicious and nearmatum," gives examples of medical personnel adding that they are most likely drunk with too much fertilizer.
And they become suppliers, not of vitamins, but of cages.
This is not agreed by the Siberian Institute of Agrarian Physics and Technology, a candidate for the village of Ver Petruk science.
She said that the right approach and compliance with all rules and requirements in greenhouses allowed for the production of full vegetables.
If you try to get more of a square metre out of a square metre, of course, you'll get watered and recharging the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too many nitrogen fertilizers, the tomatoes are growing fast, they are large but watertight and low," she explains, adding that the issue of quality depends primarily on the conscience of the manufacturer.
The Court suspended the enforcement of the decision on “stop-and-see” in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes in the programme “Declaration-and-see” of the New York Police Department and dismissed the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the enforcement of Judge Shira Schindlin ' s judgements would be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution by carrying out a programme for street detention and interrogation.
The city appealed against its decision and decisions on corrective measures, including the order to appoint a supervisor to help the police station change its work and its related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the parties ' debate on the application for the stay of the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that it was necessary to dismiss the judge because she had violated the U.S. justice code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid the display of prejudice, partly because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that the civil rights of tens of thousands of people had been violated by the police officers in an unfair manner against blacks and Latin Americans under the “stop-and-see” programme.
It had appointed an external controller to oversee major changes, which included political, training and monitoring reforms, and had set up a pilot programme to test television cameras in police stations where most of the arrests took place.
In August, New York decided to stop the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose cases were stopped after police screening.
The debate on the appeal of the city is scheduled to take place after 14 March 2014.
The “delay and search” tactics have been criticized by numerous civil rights lawyers.
The “reconcilation” has been in some form for decades, but the number of documented stops has dramatically increased in the administration of Michael Bloomberg's independent mayor, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin.
In 2004, four persons, all of them from national minorities, filed a collective complaint.
The New York Police Department says that the changes will put an end to unfair practices, create a more reliable and effective police service and can influence the way other police departments implement these practices.
The opponents claim that changes will reduce the military spirit of the police rather than the crime rate, result in unnecessary spending of money and do not address a more global problem of complex police conditions by reducing the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she continued to stop the practice of “stop-and-seeing”, which was in conformity with the Constitution, but was changing the way the New York Police stopped people.
A pedestrian zone was opened in the Third Gallery
A new pedestrian zone appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Third Gallery and is located two kilometres from the Novokuzneski metro to the Bologna Square.
Street torches, flowering pots, benches, urns and toilets, wild fences and illegal advertising have been installed all along.
In addition to the Clementski and Lavreshine alleys, which were already pedestrians, five streets were closed for vehicles - the Ordinian impasse, the Big and Small Tolmačev alley, the Kadashzewsky Coastal and Bologna Zone.
Transport on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not limited.
At the section of the Fifth Street from the lobby of the Novokhuzneski station to the Clement Street, conditions for pedestrians were created without a retracting and cutting of the carriageway, and passed on newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone was the Third Gallery, the temple of the Holy See of Clement the Pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments, and other sights.
Early on, pedestrians were once fully equipped with the Tver Passage, the Stoleškka Lane, and the street of the Kuznetsk Most.
It was decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays, with a large Dmitrov, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September.
Coulson used a hacked phone to check a confidential message
Former editor of the newspaper News of the World Andy Coleson was allegedly using a “breakup of a phone, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm the false information about Charles Clarke's novel, who was then the Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, the royal lawyer, Andrew Ediz, informed the Old Bailey court that in May 2005, News of the World received an unfortunate news that Clarke was meeting with his “involved special adviser” Anna Polby.
The newspaper directed the private detective Glenn Mulkeyre to break in Polby’s voice mail and booked her at home to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages, and heard the court.
“The accusation is that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand next to someone's house, hoping to find someone, he is the person who loves to offer history to see what they will say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said that News of the World used three methods of investigation of the stories, ranging from telephones to surveillance and opposition.
The editor is personally involved in the third one.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the match, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the telephone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes."
The rumours of Clark's novel drew attention for the first time to the wording of News of the World, when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
A voice screen received from her phone at least three times was removed from her home in August 2006.
The investigators also found notes on the private detective's computer, in which Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as “projects”.
During the period when she was under surveillance, Mrs. Polby's grandmother and grandmother received anonymous calls requesting information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At this time, the former Chief Reporter, Neville Turkbeck, and former reporter, James Westerap, monitored Ms. Polby's movement.
leaving her voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we're going to publish tomorrow and that I would really like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edity said that Coulson's participation in this story was the same as that of other influential people, such as David Blancett, former Minister of the Interior.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered a confrontation with Mr. Blancett about an affair with a married woman while he himself had met a match between Rebekka Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks deny association with other people for the hacking of telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkair, Turkbek and Weserap admitted to a cell breakup.
Snouden is willing to communicate with the FWG authorities on the wire case
CIA ex-worker Edward Snowden is willing to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so and to meet with representatives of the FWG authorities, passing over RIA News.
A representative of the Bundestag Hans-Cristian Strebel, who sent a message to the German authorities, presented a letter from a former CIA official to the FAR authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday.
Strebel the day before he dated Snowden in Moscow.
Four people were injured as a result of the fire on Tver Street
In Moscow, four passersby were injured as a result of the fire in a collector’s center on Tver Street.
According to Interfax, referring to the source of emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby were injured during the fire in a smoked underground crossing.
According to the News RIA, referring to Paul Livinsky, Head of the Department of Fuel and Energy in the capital, all homes in Tver Street have now been fully restored.
The fire in the warm ring outside the house of 15 in Tver Street took place in the evening of 31 October.
A strong smoke came out of the rainwater sewers, and a smoke smoke came out of the underground crossing at Armania’s store.
As a result, 11 houses in Tver Street were exhausted.
At 9:45 a fire was destroyed at Moscow time.
US is cutting the food allowance for the poor
Family food allowance of four is reduced by $36 per month.
Since Friday in the United States, the financial security of food tankers known as "Fedstamps" has been reduced since the end of the relevant government programme.
Family out of four people will now be allocated $36 a month less than before, says officials.
This will affect 47 million Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, the average per person allowance was 133 dollars per month.
Food aid expenditure in the United States has risen to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid from "Fudstamp" that has been called since the old days, when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
The Republicans in the Congress, however, demand further reductions in funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should aim at helping those in need of it most.
Food shop owners across America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer spending.
U.S. Congresses continue to debate how much more funding can be reduced by the Government.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platformr free of charge
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthhorn platformr free of charge on PC.
This is what WW Insider reports.
According to his data, the game was made available on Battle.net in a section of Blizzzard classical games.
However, some gamers note that only those users who account for the American part of the service are currently able to download it.
Play is not available for Russian users yet.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard's now released on PC appears to be different from the original game version.
Soundthorne also remained unchanged.
Blackhorn, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally came out on the SNES console.
His events began on planet Toul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and light kingdom.
One day, the Dark ruler, Sark, decided to kill King Vlaros of light and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death and sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Toul to fight with Sarlaca's crews and to protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game the studio released after it was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silikon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
There will be new assault rifles in the Moscow Metropolitan.
But they're not going to sell them for money, they're going to sell them for seats.
One trip at a cost of 30 roubles would cost a potential passenger 30 seats.
The number of visitors will count on a special device with modern technology, and report to ITAR-TAS with reference to the Russian Olympic Press Service.
The first apparatus will be installed at the Exhibition Station on 8 November 2013.
The presentation of the new U.S. ticket sports will be hosted by the President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Joukov, and the Olympic championships of Alexei Nehma and Elena Zulkir.
The recognition of the Agency for National Security reinforces the paranoia of corporations in relation to State surveillance
On a warm day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low over the United States Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, its task was to photograph the roof of the U.S. Mission building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say that BfV hoped to detect antennas of listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Klapper, director of the U.S. National Intelligence, again assured in September that the United States had not taken advantage of external intelligence opportunities “to steal commercial secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or profitability”.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract servant who had become a whistleblower, began to publish his treasurer of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure if the director can be trusted for his word.
Reports of United States National Security Agency monitoring the Brazilian oil company Pethrobras and gaining access to data from U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of companies caused by the surveillance of the State to new heights.
The last chapel reported that the Chancellor's phone, Angela Merkel, had been listening, perhaps, for about ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can become the target, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snouden has made evident intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it's very likely that these data are being used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up”, says Oliver Grun, President of the BITMI Association, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT company.
German companies are convinced that the United States now represents almost the same risk as China in the area of industrial spying and data theft, according to a study published in July by the EY consulting agency.
All documents revealed by Mr. Snowden nevertheless do not yet show that the United States has transmitted commercial secrets to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern about the lack of capacity of the EU in the area of information technology and the Internet and felt that it should attempt to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses are sceptical.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“It's not an option”, says Gasso Plattner, President of the German software supplier company for the business of SAP.
If there was a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have allowed it to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everyone but the IT industry.
And yet, the coverage and technical development of the U.S. spy agencies, known by the revelations of Snouden, have been a shock for some companies that once thought that China represents the greatest risk of surveillance.
There has been a major shift in cloud technologies, where European company managers have a better understanding that data stored in the United States are within the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a research conducted by the Claude Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants have refused to use the United States cloud provider ' s services after unveiling an American programme for the intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Snape, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that had not arisen a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders argue that recent reports are mere confirmation of what they already know: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and consequently these data must be protected at all costs.
What is going on in economic spying is not surprising.
He's always been there.
“This has been the subject of many years of discussion and has not changed significantly in the current debate,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive director of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we are spying on them too, because it is part of our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders generally do not like to boast about the response they have taken, as this may give priority to the opposer.
Large companies have long adopted the idea that taking a free drive on an exhibition or leaving a laptop unsupervised in hotel numbers is at least not prudent.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi vehicle company, says that for many years this has been a standard practice of collecting mobile phones in front of board meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that company managers consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
The required mobile phones are subsequently discharged.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their specific niches.
“Low and medium-sized companies often lack expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrecy from unauthorized access”, warns the report of BfV.
The US has warned its own companies of economic spying by other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Report, in February, placed France with Russia and Israel on the second set of hacking for economic intelligence, after China, claims The Washington Post.
Member of the Board of Directors of a prestigious German Company confirmed that when it came to economic spying, “Frenchs were worse than everyone”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French D.C.R. Intelligence Agency, reportedly said in an interview this month: “The authorities know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of Georgia’s adolescent who died in a “unseen accident ” believe that their son was killed
The Georgian parents, whose body was found inside a lost sports mat at the sports hall of his secondary school, believe that their son was killed, spoke to the family’s lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of the town of Valdost of Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertically standing mat attached to the rostrums in the sports hall of his secondary school.
The sheriffs of the Loundes district found that Johnson had died by tragic accident, but the 17-year-olds were challenging this.
“They are absolutely sure that their son was killed”, said Fox News.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed that he died like the sheriff said.
“They think it is contrary to logic, to the laws of physics, and to common sense, ” said Kramp.
They think it's a cover for protecting the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to their corpse bag, ” he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I believe that there is sufficient ground” for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told the reporters that the initial discovery showed that Johnson had died as a result of the positional asphyphyxiation.
However, a second discovery, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified”, he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he'll ask the FBI to conduct him.
The sheriff's representative of the Loundes district was not available for comment when approached on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a judge in South Georgia ordered the authorities to publish all the surveillance cameras that the investigators had seen.
The teenage parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained the key to the explanation of how he died.
Spartacus: For information on persons who gave a fascist symbol
On the official site of Spartacus, a statement was made by a Moscow club regarding the appearance of a Fascist flag in the platform in Yaroslavl.
"Spartacus", 30 October, was the first to show a Fascist symbol at the Jaroslavla stadium.
Requesting all those who have reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence to provide it
“Employment is guaranteed”, says the statement.
Looking for fans hanging the Fascist flag in Yaroslavl
Let's recall that at 1/16 the finals of Russia's Cup, Shinnik, Spartacus, were interrupted several times because of the riots in the rostrums.
The Spartacian fan sector also exhibited fascist symbols.
Spartacus may carry out about three rounds of punishment without spectators.
There will be a meeting of the Committee on Friday.
If you have any information about who held and delivered this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on allergies for children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations on control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first set of such recommendations that the U.S. Government has issued, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now has allergies.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the incidence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and support staff about food allergies among children and how to help in the event of an allergy reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline stocks, most commonly for injection use by EpiPen automatic medical syringe, to assist with potentially deadly anaphilic.
State legislatures have recently amended regulations to allow schools to make less-flexible adrenaline stocks.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something's ticking into my tongue," "it feels like I have hair in my tongue," or "the tongue of a pinch."
Parents of intersexual children can choose an “undetermined sex”
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third floor of children born with an intermediate type of sexual outside.
Newborns will no longer have to be attributed to a male or female gender.
The new law does not require parents to call any gender such children, allowing parents to label gender as “undetermined” or “unident” in their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions on the granting of sex to newborns and to counter discrimination against intersexual people.
One intersexual man, according to BBC, said many years later, "I'm neither a man nor a woman."
I'll stay a doctor's glass piece with bruises and scars.
Approximately one of the 2,000 children born every year are neither male nor female.
They have intersexuality, one of the approximately 60 pathological states that are diagnosed as “sexual abuse” — the collective term for people with the typical chromosomes, gonads (sensors or semens) or unusually developed by external sex organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been an intern.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that if the sex cannot be defined, it is better to take advantage of and assign to all available information than to wait for and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation takes place, if any.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Dresser, who specializes in gender identification, said that the new German law “sounds like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life- threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can assign a floor without surgery and then see how the person develops.
The science of how a child has a gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the questions as to why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as being different from transsexual or transsexual, since their condition is not related to the gender but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typical of either one of them at the same time or not.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair cover distribution, breast distribution and carpentry; primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by international and transgender persons in employment, as well as the level of harassment, abuse and prejudice-based crimes.
Boys with gender bias now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to put men, women or women into their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian resident, Norrie May-Walby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as a “sexless person” and upheld in court the right to remain a “unchanged” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use the third term in addition to M and F to X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on Channel France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, this strong Catholic country, signed a petition to remove a “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also disagreed with the German law, stating that “in a situation in which peace is retracted into a new state where gender is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization”.
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told Baby Zone the website that she would prefer children to be placed with gender at birth.
“The child’s life is hard enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know the child’s sex,” she said to the parents ’ website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital organs were called hermphrodites — a beautiful Greek god with both genders.
And just ten years ago, the medical community saw the gender as a kind of letter that we could erase and then draw again.
But now many challenge the ethical basis for surgery, knowing that gender identity is difficult, and doctors sometimes make wrong choices without knowing how a child will perceive his gender when he grows up.
“In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a ‘immune psychiatric accident’,” said Dresger.
When these children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist; you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was suggested by Dr. John Mani of the University of Jones Hopkins, who felt that the gender was easily altered.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social signals, of how parents grow a child, interact with the child's genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself to be a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during a careless circumcision, to cast his baby completely, also removed his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented a case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn’t true, ” said Dresner.
When he was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at age 38, he committed suicide.
Dreser said that some doctors are still "using this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex-change operations claimed to be “a unfortunate result”.
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer in Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY, but with intermediate-type geniuses.
The doctors could not determine for certain whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” of a man.
Hence, shortly after his birth in 1976, the external sexual organ and eggs of Bruce were surgically removed, and he was brought up as a girl.
He started to have female hormones at 12 years of age.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he told ABC News.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was given a vaginal condition.
But when he was in depression and realized something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a sexual disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal development of genitals.
Once he learned the truth, he became a man again, receiving a testosterone shot and removing his chest.
Operation made him barren.
Today, he defends others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to bring people into the norm the perception of intersexuality.
But Ann Ther-Metti, Executive Director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed House, is concerned that the German law “encourages the hanging of labels and styles”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give the child `unvalued gender',” she said.
We fear that he will facilitate intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Mr.-Metti said that her organization supported the Australian law, since it allowed adults to choose for a third sex.
“Early persons should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex,” she said.
German law refers to her appropriation at birth.
It is a battle that small children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a text-based mammologist in Pittsburgh who has a child with sexual abuse and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law would “support” both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development violation called the Androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since her receptors are not working properly, Cathy has developed a woman’s profile.
She's got all the stuff, but she's not got the uterus or the ovaries.
Now, at 29 years of age, Cathy is married and is in the juvenile psychiatry division at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite her barrenness, she hopes to be a parent by adoption or her hesitative surrogacy.
“ The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions by themselves, ” says Baratz.
He gives them time to do some analysis and to understand the situation, and how long before they write "men" or "women".
In such a case, you may be well - mannered — to raise a child, to love a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you enjoy it.
We don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and to eliminate the worry that parents are moving because they don’t feel that they are doing the right thing, ” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which regiment he or she is more comfortable with — and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make decisions on their own.
Nikolai Habiblin's winner emphasized that he understood he had to play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two "Jubev" meetings, Habibulin first missed six Tapa Bay's, and then four from "Otava," and in the second game, he was replaced by a four-year-old jack.
We've got to play well, and in the last two games, I haven't been able to do it, but CSNChyago gives the words of Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, I guess we should approach them like games, and try to achieve a better outcome.
You need to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been encountered.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel good at my training.
But for some reason after a few heads, everything turns into some sort of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
Vratari -- I don't think I'm the only one -- always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not happy.
It doesn't matter what's happening in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself so I can't miss that much.
It's great that my clubmates are supportive, but in principle it's all simple: I have to play better.
Two games aren't the whole season, but I wanted to do them better.
But what happened was that.
I have to put this aside.
I'm just gonna try to play the next match better.
The flight bus turned over to Altae.
The PAZ flight bus moved over from the Rubtsov region of the Altay province.
As a result of the accident, 13 people were reportedly injured and reported to the regional MCS office.
Previously, 10 victims had been reported by law enforcement agencies in the region.
According to the authorities, the accident took place about nine o'clock in the morning on the Nolykolak-Vishnevka road, 1 kilometre from Novikolakivka.
The bus, travelling from Rubtashka to Vishnevka, had 12 passengers and a driver, all received injuries of various degrees and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to the City Hospital No. 1 Rubtashska, and two persons were hospitalized at the Rubtska CIA.
Medvedev expects SSJ-100 to be shipped to Europe
Russia expects Superjet 100 fixed-wing aircraft to Europe once installed in Latin America and Asia.
“We expect, in general, that we will receive such agreements more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type”, cites Interfax, the words of the Prime Minister of Russia, Domitria Medvedev, who he said at a press conference with the French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Airo.
The Head of the Russian Government noted that the French colleagues were cooperating seriously, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be supplied to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he'll ever go to France," said the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the Sugo Civil Aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The lainer is designed on the basis of modern technology and offers high quality and comfort standards in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
Dniepropetrius Energy has begun a unique rescue program... of the Aesis nest
In the old age, to get to the court of the Aesis, the high - stake peasants placed a wheel against the television, and a heavy nest kept it well.
These special pillars have long been removed, so the Aicists have loved the poles of the power lines, which are based on the wire, making the aristocratic house stand firm.
Her grandmother Anja, whose home in the village of Ivanovsko Petrikovsky, a 20 - year - old family, began to notice the nest settling despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds are putting new branches above them, and the lower layer is already in between the wires, and it's about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity for the seven ayats who nested each year in tusks, pulled out and minted in summer three or four of the birds, but they don't want to be around without light.
As soon as the birds left for the warm edge, Anja’s grandmother called the Royal RES with which the support belongs.
I didn't even expect to be there so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovsk, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, and told DTEC Technical Director "Dniproblengo" Sergey Berezowski.
In fact, the wires, which are actually within the nest of 150 to 200 pounds [150 to 200 kg], have become corrosion.
At any moment, birds could have died of electrical discharge.
And the locals risked losing their light because of damage to the wires.
Therefore, liners have started an operation to save the nest, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from the Dnepropetr National University have been assisted and have developed a travel scheme for the nest.
They did exercise for district network staff.
Alexander Ponomarenko, a well-known denitler, consulted the energy industry at all stages of the reconstruction of the nest.
For start-up, it was calculated that there are more than 50 emergency “headquarters” in the emergency area.
Special metal platforms that resemble funnels were quarreled for their reconstruction.
The base was lined with sheep branches and then moved to an old nest.
According to the findings, it is sufficient to lay the old branches as a basis for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
After that, the atheists will find their own homes.
A month ago, the first nest was renovated in the village of Peschanka of Novomoskov district.
Next to the electric power station, a new iron cell was placed and a platform was placed on it with an old nest that had already been worn.
The whole operation went nine thousand dollars.
And the same village did the same day in the village of Ivanovska Petrikovsky, under the tutelage of Ani's grandmother.
Here the platform was put in place only above the wires.
Orniologists are confident that the cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their “headquarters” have been undergoing major repairs.
The same reconstruction is expected by the end of the year for four more nests in the Peasian and Kingsian areas of the Dnepropetrius region.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others are ruthlessly killed.
The day before, the whole area was hit by sad news, in the village of Ust-Kamenko of the Apostolic Region, on the day of the stage hunting, poachers shot the swan family on the pond.
The noble birds were not afraid of the people - the locals fed or ate.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, and the four beautiful ones were already dead on the water.
Now the members of the Apostolic Sunday Police are looking for who shot at the birds in the Red Book.
Russian March is getting more popular
On November 4, the Day of National Unity, the Russian March will be held in Moscow.
According to the Levoda Center, support for the Russian Marches has increased - 40 per cent of citizens have given different degrees of acceptance.
According to the Laevada Center, 40 per cent of citizens have different approvals for the "Ruska Marchs": 11 per cent of them are definitely positive, and 29 per cent of them are very positive.
The popularity of the Russian marches is gradually increasing - in 2006 only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed these actions, and in December 2010 the number of citizens (28 per cent) was already double.
Russian March only accounts for 7% of Russians, which is 19%.
A further 35 per cent were unable to formulate their attitude towards this action.
This year, Moscow's mayor agreed on a "Ruska March" of up to 15,000 people in Ljublino, as the head of the Department of Security in the capital, Alexei Majarov, reported today.
This nationalist action has been taking place every year since 2005 on People ' s Unity Day.
On the question of sociologists, “Have you heard that the Russian Marches are being held in Russia on 4 November under the slogans for the defence of Russian rights in Russia?” three quarters (75 per cent) of citizens replied negatively.
Now only 1 in 5 Russians (20%) know about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, nearly one third of the citizens (31 per cent) of the citizens of the Russian Marsha were heard.
Let us recall that three years ago, on 11 December, a natural nationalist meeting took place in Manej Square, which grew into riots.
The Levada Center also asked the Russians about the celebration of 4 November.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (National Unity Day) increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15 per cent of citizens gather to celebrate the celebration.
Approximately the same (17%) is the intention of celebrating the October Day of 7 November.
Most citizens (62 per cent) do not wish to celebrate any of these holidays.
As Moscow's mayors agreed "Rus March" in Ljublino
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March on 4 November in Ljublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Roussski association, the host of the Dmitri Demomushkin march.
In addition to the Ljublino march, a rally and rock concert will be held on People's Unity Day in Ljublino, as also agreed with the authorities.
Like "Russ March 2016" passed.
On the Day of Popular Unity in 2012, the Nationalists took the march from Yakuyan Coast to the Central House of an artist where the meeting was held.
The organizers estimated the number of participants by 20,000, the Ministry of Internal Affairs by the number 6,000.
Communication: Obama ' s pre-election headquarters considered Baiden ' s exception in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's immediate advisers secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Baiden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of all the expected books of Mark Halperin and John Hailemann about the 2012 campaign, "The Girls are doubled: The Games have changed 2012."
The Times received a copy of the book that was ready for publication and reported on Thursday evening that the closest associate presidents had conducted “intentional studies in focus groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether the exception to Baiden could help raise the negative hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to the political commentator The Times Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts of senior officials at election headquarters and the White House, namely, the former head of the White House Administration of Bill Daly, to assess the effect that the former Secretary-General Clinton, as Vice-President, would have on the voting.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected, in the Chicago pre-election headquarters and in the Oval office.
Only the six closest presidential advisers — including Dale, the former head of the election staff of Obama Jim Messin, and the former senior advisers of the White House of David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book The Stavties doubled claims that Daley was the instigator of trying to replace Baiden despite their “nearly personal relationships”, but finally refused to do so when their data showed that Clinton's addition to the electoral list would not “premise significantly Obama's chances”.
In an interview with Martin Daly, the administration did indeed consider replacing Byden Clinton.
“I was actively in favour of examining a lot of things, and that was one of them, ” said Daley in the newspaper.
You must remember that the president was in terrible shape at that time, so we thought, "Oh my God, what do we do?"
Although Dalei described the study as “necessary test”, Martin told the representative of CNN to Anderson Cooper that the pre-election headquarters had done enough to examine whether that step would bring dividends to the vote.
“The elective headquarters will not spend such amounts on interviews and focus groups if they do not seriously consider,” said Martin in AK 360.
It was not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacing them.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if his then boss knew about a possible interception.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the President “was aware of” possible replacements, the former head of administration acknowledged that it was possible to, Obama knew.
Martin added that the “Presents are doubled” did not provide a clear answer to the question as to whether the results of political sensing had reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama did not know about the study of the possibility of deleting Baiden from the electoral list.
“Maybe, ” said Martin.
Do you want the light in the dark ice cream?
A British businessman created the world's first light in the dark, jellyfish ice cream.
Charlie Francis used marine florescent properties to come up with light food.
He came to this idea, read the science article on jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to re-establish a brightening protein.
The ice cream reacts with the language of the eater, increasing the pH level in the protein and forcing it to shine.
Chris says that since the ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lie, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company, "Lize me, I'm delicious," says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still in the very beginning, when you're talking about production, so for "200, you're going to get about 2 g of substances."
The Bell that we use in the ice cream reacts with your language at the neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, it'll increase the pH level and the ice cream will start to shine.
We've tested it over the last few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce it to Halloween, because it creates such a remarkable lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done because it's four times as expensive as gold.
So every balloon is around the corner.
But it's pretty good to taste.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and bitumen gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
It's not possible by definition because of the ice crystals that make up ice, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the florescence properties of the jellyfish synthetic by Chinese scientists
Avangarda coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, referring to the preparation of his team for a regular CHL championship v. Salawat, noted that the unsuspecting carried out a thorough analysis of the injury to the magnetic Metallurga.
The specialist stressed that Avangard should pay more attention to the game of defense.
We've watched a video game against a magnetic Metallurg, which is an official source site called Avangard.
- We missed a lot of pebbles, not a very nice moment.
Missing due to their errors, due to failure of the game task.
We knew the opponent had the performers.
According to the statistics, they had five attacks on the move -- three scooters killed us.
Very good implementation.
These mistakes were taken into account in preparing for today's game?
We're going to have every match, we're talking after the game, we're ready for a new rival.
The main thing is to keep the installation running.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurga.
The game assignment was executed, and the score was 2:0.
We missed the nude in the lockerhouse, and in the third period, we started to make mistakes.
Because of the difficulty of the game, I didn't see any point in connecting the defenders.
You have to stand up to the team.
Right now Avangard has a long home series, matches go in a day, and the team's got tired?
All the teams are under the same conditions.
The key now is to carry out your moments and play assignments.
Hokkai is an emotional game, if you run a plant, it doesn't work that hard.
Because of the new regulations introduced by the Russian Customs, it has been almost a week since the Russian border has been in line for hundreds of Furs.
Today, Dominican officials promised to provide the drivers with drinking water and biotuals
Hundreds of Furs were dug at the border points when they entered Russia.
This situation is due to a change in the rules on Customs handling of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that they are creating a Russian side that has not warned in advance of developments.
Since 28 October, Russian Customs authorities have taken additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, as reported by Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs.
The new model document is being used in countries that have acceded to the convention on international transport.
Pass points run high mode.
FACACOV Correspondence visited the border and contacted the hostages.
Prices in the roadside coffee shop at the Novovoazsk passes are rising every day, as is the Four turn.
The trucks are lined up about a mile [2 km] long.
The Novosovsk-Vessel-Vesenessnka Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine through the international highway.
From there, the goods are sent to the Russian, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia border in Stavropol.
On Sunday until midnight, the rules were passed, followed by the introduction of the rules, which was complained of by Alexey Headanev, a farce driver, who carries goods across Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need additional documents and cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance it is brought to.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5,000 roubles (about 1,100 - 1,300 rouves).
Those who travel near Georgia, Armenia, with a cargo of up to $50,000, pay about 15,000 roubles (3,800 roubles) and travel.
And the others are stuck, because nobody has so much money with them.
Can you imagine if the driver is carrying goods worth only four thousand dollars? But as far as Moscow is concerned, he needs 90,000 rubles (some 23,000 gram) to pay for transit!
The conditions for survival at the border are none, and the pilots who make up their cars.
It's always expensive at border shops and cafes, but prices like this, we haven't met anywhere!
The sellers concentrated on it and quickly got rid of it: 15 grilode baton, 7 grizzly coffee, and 25 flute soup plates.
There's one of them.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the bathroom.
Don't wash or shave...
I can't get out of my car for a week, my wife made it all up.
The week of the journey, Víctor Skotarenko comforts himself.
Is it just a week-long line to reach my car?
Why do you have one and a half litres of water?
There's 11 and 15 balls.
What, a bottle of crystal or water standing on silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take something else to eat while you're on the line with the dealer.
After media coverage began, Ukrainian drivers drew the attention of the authorities of the region to the plight of the country.
The leadership of the Amvrossian and Novoazo Paradise Administrations has been instructed to provide for all those who take the line on the Ukrainian-Russian border with potable water, as the Acting President of the Donetskka District Administration, Sergey Dergunov.
The ambulance crew is now on duty at the crossing points.
Biotales will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the problem of succession will be solved in the next few days.
As at 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles had been used by the Press Service at the international checkpoints on “Suppunk” and “Novovoazzsk”, respectively.
The “FACT” will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to brand the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against the high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership, such as a statement by the BNS in the Department of State Security of the Republic.
Information on this is published on the DELFI portal.
In particular, Moscow intends to “speak” the President of Lithuania, Dal Gribauskat, and to publish falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosarid, which relate to the facts of the curriculum of the leader of Lithuania.
According to intelligence services, the Department of Public Administration Analysis of the Public Administration of the President of the Russian Federation is conducting the preparation of an information attack on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeni Umerenko, who has visited Lithuania on numerous occasions and participated in the Lithuanian People ' s Party Congress.
A staff member of Department V. Smirnov is also allegedly a participant.
Smyrnov, according to the Special Service, had regularly visited Lithuania before the end of 2012 under the cover of scientific work and had been in contact with local politicians, politicians and the media.
Smirnovu is now prohibited from entering the country.
On the previous day, the President of Lithuania, Gribauskate, announced that he knew about the information that was being produced.
In her view, the main reason is Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of Europe and “the country's commitment to energy independence”.
The Lithuanian leader has not previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She thus stated that in the Kremlin, Lithuania was “insufficiently respected”.
In addition, Gribauskate accused the head of the Russian Federation of Vladimir Putin of proposing “one claim only”.
Remember, in September, the Rustabinasor suspended the import of Lithuanian "mol" to Russia.
The quality of the product was reported to be inconsistent with health and epidemiological standards.
At that time, the leader of Lithuania stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, his Government must prepare a reference to WTO.
In the U.S., the headmaster of the school was shooting teenagers.
The head of an American secondary school literally led to despair.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
An incident occurred in Tennessee.
As reported in The New York Post, teenage hooligans dropped the men's house in toilet paper.
As a result, the school principal opened fire on adolescents, which resulted in a slight foot injury and a 15-year-old boy receiving a hand.
Since the hooligans were not present in the Director ' s property, he was charged with an aggravated attack.
The man was released on bail from prison at $125,000.
We will note that shooting at civilians in the United States is becoming a horrible occurrence.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of the city of Ryjkres in California, U.S.A., straight across the street.
After that, the criminal took two random passersby hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car, and tried to escape.
Previously, gunfire had been opened at the primary school in Newton, Connecticut.
Adam's mother was at school, she was a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and have a masquerade for our area.
I'm more like a squirt now.
I haven't been summoned in the last two years to distribute candy in my apartment and I'm probably not going to be this year.
However, the statistics show that I am a white crow in the case of Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans — namely, 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on religion, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing that I'm waiting for every Halloween is training.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the costumes will cost $1.2 billion of spent $6.9 billion.
Sexually unanticipated objects are on the verge of fashion this year.
Women no longer have to be sex workers; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
With regard to men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to The Good Dead, and I'm sure the astronauts in the Daft Punk will be on our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the most common costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
Perhaps there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We planted our dogs last year, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
It means a lot of funny go-go dogs.
When it comes to the candy, we don't have to talk.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about £600 million of Heshey chocolate, lazy, Milk Duds, Twizlers gems and Clark Bar cans.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, these are excellent news for the 41 million child-requirers who are preparing to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and — let us not lie — eat £90 million of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we do not want to use is corn beans; nevertheless, according to the National Condden Association, almost £35 million is sold under Halloween.
This is about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a puzzle I've got to figure out.
Nothing like a ghosthouse.
They have amazing names, such as "The Ujas outside the walls" (which, by the way, is in this prison), "Way and Scream" and "The House of Refuge".
Moreover, according to American Humans society, there are 1,200 officially recognized visiting houses in America that generate about $500 million of income, as well as those amazing photographs where you've almost described what your friend put on Facebook and you can't clean, and then the guy who likes you sees this photograph and leaves a comment like, "class expression of face."
And finally, we'll talk about the tobacco.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Grand Ticva when we were children, and the cutting of Jack's sweater is like the ornament of Christmas tree, what we've been doing since childhood.
Fortunately for us, a child's fashion in a pump started only last year because of the Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out these tobaccos rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on swabs.
Jack's lightstand, slowly pouring out on your wing, is probably coming from the state of Illinois, which grew to £542 million this year.
If you want more complicated tasks, visit Tim and Susan Metisdon in Napa State of California and try to cut something out of their 2032 pounds.
The Mynoboroughs of Estonia were restored after the Ukrainian hackers were attacked
The work of the Estonian Ministry of Defence's website was restored following the morning cyber attack and reported to the press service of the authorities.
According to Tair Peterop's vice-cunner, the website just overloaded a lot of requests on information and administrative issues.
Our specialists quickly set up the site up, and the work of the site has now been restored.
"The damage done to the Ministry is minimal," said Peters.
According to Peterop, it is too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
“We will necessarily analyse the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is not possible to prevent such incidents completely”, he admitted.
In fact, on 1 November, the Anonymous Group of Ukraine placed a webcast confirming the hacker attack on the Estonian Miniborone website and against the partnership of Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We don't have to be NATO's servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be a slave of any kind.
We are in favour of the independent Ukraine.
"Extreme from Ukraine," states Anonymous.
Previously, the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that the fleet of Marine Infantry, Theodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Infantry, would participate in NATO Command and Staff Training Exercises, Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Bottle forced several schools and hospitals to be closed because of the impurity of the force
Four schools in Zimbabwe province of Southern Matabeleland had to be closed because the students were attacked by... goblins.
As the local elder described it, the children fell into panic, and it proved impossible to continue.
The story of Goblins may sound like a child's invention for a European, but in Africa this is a very serious reason for closing school.
Adults too fear unclean power.
In summer, for example, the hospital in Zimbabwe was closed because the hospital had also been attacked by hoblins.
Launched the Land Rover Race Series
Inside are racing seats and six-point safety belts, as well as internal communications.
It is also possible to obtain modernized brakes, a package of services that provides access to Bower Works mechanics, logistics support and car storage between activities.
Drew Bowler, the manager of Bowler Motorport, said, "The members who turned to Bowler changed."
Some of them are not experienced persecutors, but people who seek excitement, adventures and access to world-class activities.
We are pleased to suggest such a path, in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and believe that this format offers a new way of trying different disciplines in Britain and abroad and preparing participants for difficult conditions and realities of the Rallis.
We were very happy to design the Defender Challenge — a truly fascinating championship.
In addition, Defender Callenge offers one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian Powermakers are not aware of the group “Bratsk Circle” - New News
This is described by INTERFAX.RU in reference to an informed source in law enforcement agencies in the Russian Federation.
"As soon as news reports were received in the media that the U.S. Department of Finance had entered control lists on suspicion of being a member of the Eurasian criminal syndicate 'Bratsky Circle', we looked through all the databases, but we did not find such a group," said the agency's interlocutor.
In his view, the dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which is allegedly operating abroad.
As previously described by the NI, the U.S. Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the “Bratsk Circle” criminal group.
Among them was the name of Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He's on the list like Grisha, we put it on the previous day.
The popular Russian performer is the same.
The name is Grigory Lepsevreidze, creatively pseudo, place and date of birth.
Aside from Leps, five other people were mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a Uzbek citizen and another member of the former USSR whose nationality is not indicated.
In the United States, it is certain that Gregory Leap, who lives on Phuket Island, was able to carry money to bandits on their orders.
A photo of the singer is attached to the communication, and all of its data are included, which is consistent with the validity.
Moreover, Leps had really just bought a house on Phuket.
The agency noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
Man ' s blacklisting of U.S. Minsk entails the freezing of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him by persons residing in the United States.
Assistant Lepsa Maya Serikov said that there were no notifications to the singer: "It's hard to answer the question whether it's Grigory, who's all being talked about in connection with the scandal in the United States."
Everything Leps knows is media information.
There was no formal notice of any kind to him, although I do not know if they are available in such cases.
"And, of course, that's all funny on the one hand and surprising on the other, and unexpected," she said to the RIA News.
She said that Gregory Leops didn't live on Phuket, but according to U.S. Minphine, he really had a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was now in a long tour of the Far East and Siberia and that the news had caught him on his flight to the city of Good News.
A boy who fled to a field at Shinnik's.
There have been some details about the identity of the fan who fled to the field during match 1/16 of the finals of the Russian Cup between the Yaroslav Szynnik and Moscow’s Spartak.
According to RFC Head Arte Grigoriantz, referring to data from the IDD, this is a Muscovite.
Right now he's been arrested.
"In addition, Grigoriantz described how a fan managed to break through into the field, "It turns out that this, called him a spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He came to the emergency, which was confirmed to us by the ambulance.
Then he pushed the two escorts away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South rostrum to the corner of the East and North rostrum.
He ran through the whole field.
The flight attendants are responsible for this.
Before the Act on Sport enters into force, this area of action of the flight attendants - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the rostrum, ran across the eastern rostrum.
And during that time, riots broke out in the eastern rostrum and on the tracks,” the head of KDC said.
Let's recall that the decision of KKK in Moscow “Spartacus” will hold, without audience, the next match of the 15th Cup against Lokomotiv and Zenita, and will also pay a fine of 600,000 roubles.
Fire crews were called to save a lost puppy, stuck 50 feet above the ground in a dangerous career
Ruby's coke ran away after he got into a small accident.
Three days later, when she was stuck in a career, a dog-ducking man noticed
Firemen went down a rope on a spring slope to save the dog from imminent death
The girl was fortunate enough to be saved after the firefighters had been summoned to raise him and take him to a safe place, after somehow he was stuck at 50 feet on a dangerous slope.
The nine-month Spanish coroner Ruby fled after he was hit by a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from his career on Wednesday.
Her host, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at the Flappapa in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby, and thanked West Yorkshire fire rescue and rescue service.
They went to the social networking sites after she ran into a career after a small accident.
At about 4: 15 a.m. on Wednesday, a star guide noticed Ruby, stuck 50 feet in the entryway.
A technical rescue unit from the Kleckheton fire station rushed to the scene, went down the ropes to save Ruby, and used a wire to lift her up the slope.
The rescue officer, Andy Clayton, said, "She was in a dangerous position."
It was about 50 feet [50 m] to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move, and she was muscleed when she was saved, and she got completely frozen.
But she's fine right now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is incredible.
The rescue officer, Peter Lau, said, "The Rubys are very fortunate that they saved her."
She was likely to have suffered a very serious trauma or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for inspection, and it was found that everything was okay with her except exhaustion and desalination.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "The observation of salvation was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was back in our hands.
The veterinarian said that if she were to pass out and lose consciousness, she would probably fall.
The firefighters were great.
It was very bold — what they had done.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of the town of Kitley added: “We feared that it might fall, but it stayed there”.
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Cathy Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview on the Australian radio show this week, a pop star said that she was a bec-scalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old habitis die hard.
Perry said she was having dinner with a veteran biker and said, "He played with me when I was 18. "
She added: "It was a long time ago and it was very good."
In a statement on Thursday, the representative of Jagger's seventy-year-old said that he was “categorically denying that he had ever hit Cathy Perry.”
The representative added: "Perhaps she is confusing him with someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as visitors to the Rolling Stone tour this year.
Her new Prism album was debuting first place this week.
George Kerevan: The gap with Europe gives Scottish people a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time, we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition of membership in the EU.
There are reports of passport control in Bervik and of the barbed wire along Adrianova's hive.
True, the Stratton newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movement throughout Europe, although, predictablely, it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did no reference be made to the fact that EU member countries were spending a lot of time turning their formal rules as comfortable as they were.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Shengen zone, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap assignment to Brussels to replace what he really wanted from Scottishs.
So it's not a worthy story.
So old that she became a cohort: for the first time, I heard a message that "independentness means passport control" was at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting moment lost in the story of an old story.
Why should independent Scotland even obey Europe’s orders?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the Euro-crisis project, the European project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposing the EU or abolishing the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the party of Europeans, the Altertavawi for Germany — founded only this year — emerged from nowhere and obtained nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially pushing the “Free Democracies” (the equivalent of our Liberal Democratics) from Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The strict economy measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the footwear imposed on national economies through the retention of a single currency have led many to believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis had little to do with national governments working in excessive budget deficits — that was only true for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members at exchange rates beneficial to German exporters — that German politicians are willing to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself in a situation of pre-conditional disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only life-saving means is to cut salaries and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current problems of budget and currency are the deeper problem of European productive capacities.
As a result of the “green” energy package implemented by Brussels — a cipher meaning subsidies to French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer — the European industry pays twice as much for electricity as it pays four times as much for gas as the United States.
It's a paralytic price conditions, as we've seen at Granjmouth.
No freezing of wages in the world will stop the US cheap, oil-based slatting power over the European petroleum industry.
As a result, rebellion emerges, especially in France, once the EU's icyest supporter.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way of controlling Germany and putting Paris at the same level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the devastated economy of France in a state of distress.
The result was the right against the EU of Marin Le Pen party, the National Front, just won the decisive additional elections by giving up the ruling party of the socialist.
Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote — a timely warning to British Labourists that it cannot be assumed that a split of the right will automatically be in favour of the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly acquired popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use EU elections next year to establish a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If — and this is very likely — the parties against the EU will receive support in these elections, such a bloc will be able for the first time to take over the position of the European Parliament.
This is my view: the rapidly growing moods against the EU, and against the single currency in Europe, join together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something of a vague European (supervised) nation that General de Hall liked.
Germany and several economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I expect Britain to move from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific points to the likelihood that Britain will remain neglected in the cold Atlantic.
What position does that leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region, in fact, of Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to the line.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed within the framework of a more free European arrangement, provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be simpler in the non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party Government, in Scotland, is, oddly, the most successful political movement in Europe against the harsh economy, which received an impressive majority in 2011 because of objections to the reduced costs proposed (and incurred) by the Labour Treasury Chancellor, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent coalition of thoracies and liberal democracies.
Scotland would now be in a position to vote for independence only in order to take the harsh economy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sexual maturity: aging
African and Latin American girls tend to grow older than their white peers by showing research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturity is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals have been developed
Experts believe that obesity may be one of the starting mechanisms for early sexual maturity
The trend towards early sexual maturity is not as strong for boys as it is for boys.
Former correspondent, CNN Pat Eteridge, a journalist specializing in child and family health.
Should the mother be afraid if her daughter starts to develop breast-feeding and lobic hairs at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
“I’m spending a lot of time trying to calm my parents, ” said Caplovitz.
Visible signs of development, such as growing breasts, frontal hairs, armpits, and body smell, are early in life among girls.
But there has been only a slight displacement of Menarche (first menstruation) for the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and had fallen from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years before menarche,” said Caplovitz, also author of the book ‘Engine sexual maturity of girls: how to cope with this widespread problem.’
Time is the most accurate test of how sexual maturity will progress.
What is considered to be a de facto advance of sexual maturity is discussed, but what is considered to be “premature” when breast growth is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop — something the paediatrician can watch carefully.
More rapid progress can be a basis for endocrinologist analysis to avoid serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone ageing, which may eventually slow growth and slow growth at maturity.
The recommendations for treatment or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
The Capolist is careful with the drugs, but acknowledges that “the abuse of sexual maturity may reduce behavioural problems and the feelings of girls that they are different from peers”.
Another major problem is clear: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy, or even about how they will cope with health issues, ” said Caplovitz.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter started menstruation at 10 years of age.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset because she was the first friend of her friends.
There are many theories that have been developed about the causes of early sexual maturity.
However, there is no consistent evidence that the hormonal is responsible for milk or other foodstuffs, for chemicals in the environment, or for sexual parcels in the media.
Boys — like girls — have earlier sexual maturity.
Caplovitz claims that the prerequisite that has the greatest weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, it helped to study girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which links fat in the body to puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
African American and Latin American girls tend to grow old before their white peers.
There are different explanations.
Worldwide, the effects of early sexual maturity seem to affect everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery is that while boys have hair on their faces and on their foreheads at a younger age, the tendency towards early sexual growth is less pronounced than do girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even infants and children of young age have the appearance of ripened and lobbying hair.
“We must be careful about how we define the true advance of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, an endocrinologist at Gorib Children’s Hospital in Morristaun, New Jersey.
Parents should not be embarrassed to receive instructions from a pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This may mean more than expected talk, ” explained Caplovitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who thrive early need confirmation that even when this is done before, this process is a normal part of life.
Stucking in Chit U.S. Boeing getting ready to fly
Monitoring flights under the Open Sky Treaty over Russia and an unscheduled landing at Chité by an American aircraft on Friday, 1 November, at 830 Moscow, will leave the city's air harbor.
The airport authorities were allowed to fly by boat for a day’s fuel.
The aircraft is said to be flying to Ulan Ude.
According to other data, it's going to go to the United States.
It is reported that an aircraft flying to Ulan Ueda landed in Zabaykal province because of the fog.
Because of unpaid accounts, he was not released from Chita Airport.
There are 30 persons on board, including crews, who spent two nights at the airport, reporting by ITAR-TASS.
According to the requirements of the Open Sky Treaty in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, people on board aircraft have no right to go out of Chita airport, they can pass border controls only at two Russian airports in Cuba and Ulaan Ud.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992, involving 34 States.
Observation flights are being carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and the countries of Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the promotion of transparency, the promotion of the monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, enhanced capacity for crisis prevention and crisis management within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do late monks earn - CIC in the U.S.
In 2013, Madonna was the head of a population of famous people with the highest incomes, making $125 million.
But the late Michael Jackson caught her, whose death income amounted to 160 million from October 2012 to October 2013.
It is remarkable to see him behind the other glamorists who, last year, “have worked” several times less.
Elvis Presley, 55 million a year after the year, was the second of the most advanced back-to-backs known as the Elvis Presley, and the bottom-up author of the Piants Charles Schulz comics with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, the former leader of 25 million last year, and musician Bob Marley (18 million), joined the first five.
It's also a list of Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein.
Igor Gulaev opened his first stand in Moscow
On 23 October, Igor Gulaev, the first flagship in Moscow, was opened.
The designer Igor Gulawev is known to the general public for his great works of lux mechanical art.
And now they're able to be assessed by even more fashionists -- his first stand finally opened in Moscow, which is why the designer did a dols vita party.
I am sure that the most beautiful girls in Russia live in it.
That's why I'm particularly glad I opened up a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That is how Igor cut a red tape and invited all who wish to... illustrate the models!
Jet jet manufacturers are hostile to seat width when large orders are made to a convoy
The leading aircraft manufacturers had a bitter dispute over the width of the tourist class seats on the far voyages, and the tone for fierce confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The line revolves around the width of the seats provided on long-road voyages to an economic class passenger whose interests are not always at the centre of the airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the allegations of the efficiency of recent aircraft proposed by Airbus SA and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that provides for a seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy, but its main American competitor Boeing says it must be decided by the airline.
The dispute is taking place at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sales of their two-motor long-range aircraft and potentially record orders are expected at the events of 17-21 November.
The combination of the rear of the aircraft — especially whether 9 or 10 persons in a row — is central to applications for the economic efficiency of the new “mini-aerbus” projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will contain 406 persons, based on seats in the economic class of more than 17 inches in width, 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18 inch wide seats, 9 in rows.
Airplane giants are often exchanged on technical issues by means of commercial press coverage.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly to Dubai, where 777X is expected to lead more than 100 orders.
She has recently shown what could be the beginning of a new advertising war by showing the financers a slide depicting three people in a single restaurant called "Do you agree to it?"
“Boeing offers long-range highway flights to seats more narrow than regional turbines,” said Airbus John Lihi, head of sales.
With diet changes, people gain weight, but air seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the wide green Boeing 747 set standards for modern journeys, the weight of the average American male aged between 40 and 49 increased by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
In the 21st century, the average American man's waist is estimated to be 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average gripping of those recently referred to as the “reactive public” was already in place.
Airbus said that a study had found that an additional inch in the seat width improved the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests airbus's seats and says that manufacturers should not intervene in decisions on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and conveniences.
She said that research showed that the convenience of the saliva was not limited to the width of the seat.
“It is all really about giving airlines the choice and the ability to do what they believe they should do to succeed, ” said a Boeing expert at Kent Crewer salon.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase space side by side, but for suppliers, this is increasingly a factor that can affect profits.
This dispute is followed by a flight-order race, estimated at at least $700 billion at catalogous prices in the coming decades, that is enough to change the ratio of American to European exports.
The positioning of seats, as reported in the Reuters Agency for the first time in July, is precisely what heats up the competition between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing state a 20 per cent increase in profitability by one place in their last two-motor highway models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated characteristics of Boeing are partly based on a comparison of the 10-day row of 777X with the original 9-day layout of the constructive decision 777.
Wins in per unit cost decrease compared to the 10-day package currently used.
“The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our developments, ” said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus Lunching Department in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the 10-place compartments for the existing 777-x indicate that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“A seat of eighteen inches wide would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is threatened by the 777th model,” said the interior specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girls Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a supplier catalogue from which airlines can choose from.
Global travelers of jet aircraft even carry roulettes to check competing planning.
In the heat of the weather, all manufacturers also offer very densely packed cabins for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10-place rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus had emphasized the need for additional modifications of the saloons by offering wider passage space on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major modern aircraft manufacturer, experts say that its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to take off, but could divert attention from the wave of the sale of the model 77X.
A new antibiotic vaccine could deprive the smoking process of its pleasure.
Scientists have developed an antibiotic vaccine that could eliminate cigarette smoking.
One dose of vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests are needed before the start of human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Cristall of the New York College of Medicine said the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can at last help millions of smokers who have tried to drop out of the market today, but have discovered that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to produce genetic information for the production of antibiotin antibodies.
The virus in selectively injects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antitel.
The antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from taking a nicotine blow.
In tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mice that were not vaccinated were "feeled", and it's a sign that nicotine was rising to their brain -- the researchers say.
These experiments are found in Science Transnational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high antitel level, the injections needed to be made so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is probably going to be much lower because it turns liver cells into an antitel factory.
Professor Kristall said that if a future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette while avoiding nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely that she'll use smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of nicotine vaccine, and that could help them to get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but they warned that further research was needed.
Olynics: one third of the rural settlements of Podmokovya
Vice Governor, Pomokovya Yuri Oleinnikov, stated that nearly one third of the rural settlements in the Moscow region were fully supplementary.
Total grants from the region ' s budget are received by 187 settlements out of 288.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 received grants from the regional budget.
The share of contributions to the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent of the total.
In the context of budgetary security, about 25 billion roubles are sent from the regional budget,” said Oleanika.
Also, the Vice Governor noted that only three urban settlements - Mytish, Singlesao and Puskino - had more than 1 billion roubles in 2013.
Rural income in many areas is less than 3 million roubles, “that's not enough”.
The cost of maintaining the local administrative facility in 88 Submoscowaya settlements is over 70 per cent, “with the quality of the services being reduced”, noted Olivniki.
He had previously instructed the heads of the municipalities of Podmokoviya to consider, before the end of November, which settlements needed to be expanded, merged into urban districts or modified administrative administration.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to this, the Governor of Moscow stated that the administrative reform in Podmoskoquiya planned to reduce the number of Dotsy rural settlements.
Also in the Cany, Kashirsk, Solarnekov, Colorado, Luberzah and Koténica, there is a request for the perpetuation of municipalities.
Discussions on this issue will begin in November in cities and areas of the region.
The President of the Modeldumid Igor Brinzal also stated that it was all in the context of the coming Adamaform that some 30 rural settlements in 12 sub-divoquia areas were planned.
This is because of the fact that, out of 178 rural settlements in the Podmokovowé, less than one third have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 have a Dotage base.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diane Arbenina doesn't cover up the great pleasure she enjoys raising her children.
Although Arbenina is now especially busy in creative and social activities, she still has the opportunity to join Martha and Artem, not only in spending time on their education, but also in fun as much as she can.
In the last week, Diane was twice reported to her worshipers on her educational talents.
First she put a picture in Facebook that shows her teaching children to read.
And yesterday, I saw fans, and I showed him how Artemis and Martha put it on Halloween.
"Our first halfwayen" -- that's what Diane called a picture of her children dressed in birthday costumes.
That's not wise, because they, like any other Russian boys and girls, are related to this event because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce a “unidentified sex” in the registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed for the registration of children born to hermofrodites, instead of male or female.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the count of “sol” on an incomplete birth certificate.
For "F" (women's sex) or "M" (men's sex) parents can write "H" for the time being.
This decision is intended not to encourage parents to rush into an operation of sex specificity.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns born in the world is hermaphrodite.
Tripodi denies being affected by Obeda
The former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the investigator of the state's anti-corruption supervisory body.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi refutes changes in the lease arrangements for maritime facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who has secretly owned shares in three property units in State land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had lobbied several state ministers to extend leases to Serkular Kie, where the Obeid family owned two restaurants and cafes, without passing the tender after their expiration in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret participation in real estate facilities, following statements made by former Deputy Head of Administration, Mr. Tripodi Lynn Ashpool, on Thursday.
Over the years of the discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease should be presented in an open competition.
The tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer lease periods.
In 2009, the Cerkular Ki leases, which were delivered to the Obeid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who had been Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, had originally advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, urged that the Government ' s rent policy should be amended.
The IACC ' s presentation of telephone conversations took place in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Coutam, the senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after Mr. Obeid ' s work in the Fisheries Division.
“Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations the development of commercial rental policies?” asked Mr. Tripodi, Assistant Commissioner, Anthony Willy.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obed.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
The high-ranking administrative officer, in an interview with Fox News, confirmed that Israeli warplanes had attacked targets at the Syrian port city of Latakiy on Thursday night.
The officials didn't know it was the target, but they said it was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the targets were those of Russian SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel launched air strikes on missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers, by division 457 visas, may be tested for “deniality”
A “density” test for foreign workers on class 457 visas is under consideration by the Government, as it calls for an expansion of repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, will be applied on the criteria aimed at preventing the use of a class 457 visa to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole to move family and friends to Australia.
The paper presented by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Leborist deputy Maxine McCue criticized the Government ' s rhetoric about foreign workers, said that this might offend Australia ' s neighbours.
“Foreign statements like ‘Foreign at the end of the line’ and ‘a job-place for Australians’ are a very unpleasant passage to the times when trade unions were demanding a safe labour market,” she said to the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was the white work that needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw the sounds of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The document before us sets out the 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Brendan O'Connor, Minister of Immigration, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets officials on human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are under consideration.
If the criteria of “line” are accepted, the applicant may be examined to obtain a visa “whether the candidate is genuine in the circumstances where the candidate is a relative or close to the acquaintance of the owner or the person involved in the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also require that the number of Division 457 visa holders be reported, as there were hundreds of employees in the past who sponsored a small number of employees.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Lenqin asylum-seeker allegedly died of an infarction following the arrival of refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The murdered nine-year-old son of this man accompanied him on his way to Australia and, since his father's death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also aboard the ship.
The Australian authorities hurriedly sent a man to a hospital on Christmas Island where he died.
A friend of Simeon Warlam stated that hockeyist is alcoholic.
A friend of Hokkeist Simeon Warlamov Evorgia Vavrinyuk claims that he suffers from alcoholism by transmitting the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said a woman in particular.
Recall that Vavrinyuk went to court for the beating of Simeon Warlam, a member of the Colorado Club, on the needles of Russia's Russian assembly.
She said that the hockeyist dragged her by the hair and beat her, after the attack, her hands, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Warlams himself came to the Denver Police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at $5,000.
The court did not restrict athletes in the country, but forbade them to approach Vavrinyuk.
He is also in danger of being imprisoned for domestic violence for up to six years.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact on Scotland of the HS2 railway project.
Project HS2 involves the opening of a high-speed communication with Scotland and northern England, with the start of the First Phase in 2026
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, said that the project would unite Britain.
The Scottish Minister of Transport, Kit Brown, said that he was “rejoicing” from the prospect of working on a plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, lines will be laid at Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of construction of the high-speed line between London and northern England from ‐32.7 billion to ‐42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is negotiating with the Transport Scotland, has mandated HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and reduction in travel time for North England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to cross the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our HS2 goal is to create a real national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other."
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are huge.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also the transport link of cities to each other; throughout the United Kingdom, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburg, will receive better communication thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State, Alistair Carmayle, added: “The daily announcement is good news for Scotland”.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Kit Brown called on Mr. Carmayc to support “symmely” the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the overall argument for a high-speed railway across the UK.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glasgow railway line, Edinburg, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and to a joint decision on the next steps.
Thorya's a new nuclear hope?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
The combustion of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
The atomic energy can be used without it, but it leaves a lot of expensive waste disposal.
Scientists have recently drawn attention to the thorium -- another radioactive element in the Mendelev system.
It appears to meet around the world, and experts say that its degradation leaves no waste that has to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia to date
Australian airline passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the United States to ease the regulations for these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in the Air Force.
Passengers can already do so during the main part of the flight, but many are upset that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required a great deal of work from United States airlines to meet new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
In the Department of Safety of Civil Aviation, it was also noted that they were considering the statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during the critical stages of the flight were still in effect in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Administration currently does not have specific regulations to regulate the use of electronic devices in aircraft”, it stated.
This issue is regulated by rules that require air carriers to ensure safety at any time and by passengers to comply with the safety regulations to which crew members are informed.
Vohrgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, increased use on board its Wi-Fi entertainment system, was not against the change, but had stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Office of the issue of authorization of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it is available on our aircraft (the frontless wireless entertainment system),” said the Spokesperson.
Quantas stated that she would adhere to the current rules.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not about to change it soon,” she stated.
The FAU regulation applies to United States airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit the passengers, and we will certainly be careful to examine the decisions of the FAH and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the influence of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
The carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as review of manuals, training materials, manual handling standards and passenger instructions.
“After the airline has verified and confirmed its fleet’s capility, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic instruments such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any altitude,” said FAU.
In rare cases, the crew will give instructions to passengers to remove their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group ' s recommendation, the heavier equipment shall be placed under the seats or in the upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Dagestan's look is heard in Cuba's hymni of extremism's notes
The "Anji" and "Cuba" play a role in the political conflict between the Krasnodar and Dagestan authorities after the fans burned the Daggestan flag and Cuba's hyminite sounded differently.
The head of Dagestana Ramamán Abdulatov on Thursday invited the republican parliamentarians to go to court, because the Crimean Gymna of the Krasnodar Province allegedly called for inter-ethnic discord, in particular calling for a war with the bassunnams.
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar province, and this was adopted by our time in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one's doing it.
"We are going to the battle on basurmanin for you, to record the words in sin and to smite some of the other believers," expressed solidarity with the President of the Parliament of Hizri Shihsiid.
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Assad
Now, the news is from the ocean, namely, from Syria, where, as we have heard today, Israel has attacked Russian production missiles, which are said to have been Hezbollah.
Today Syria has met the important requirement of destroying its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached through Russian mediation that allowed the United States not to carry out a military operation to which they had entered the full course of the summer.
More details about weapons and what this means for the Syrian President will tell our main international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington stated that the Assad regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from the poisoning gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a transaction made by a friend of Assad, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will renounce its chemical weapons by the middle of the next year.
And today is an important milestone.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had dispossessed the declared chemistry factories.
A longer-term and daunting task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
We understand that this is about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say the days of Assad were destined.
I think Asad should leave.
The question is not whether this will happen, but when it happens.
He's no longer legitimate and he has to leave.
But Asad stays.
And it feels even more confident.
Its troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
Its opponents are separated and poorly armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some have to eat leaves and baskets.
Many believe Bashar Asad escaped punishment for murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Asad himself was impressed by a cooperative person.
Today, in Washington, D.C., the United States Ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is unlikely to be killed without being killed by chemical weapons.
Asad is still holding.
And he changes his weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation set up a separate Ministry of Construction and JCH
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, established a new Ministry responsible for construction and JCH and proposed to head his ex-Hubertaire in the Ivan region of Mikhail Menu during a personal meeting.
The President met Michael Menim at the residence in Novo Ogarevo, and June did not refuse to head the new office.
The President of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, explained that all the construction and JCH functions were transferred to a new Ministry from Minsk.
Michael Man is the son of a prominent Orthodox priest, the prototyre of Alexander Mee, and finished Moscow’s Gobkin Petroleum Institute.
Since 1995, his political career had begun, and he had been elected to Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergivo-Pasada district, a member of the State Duma, the first Vice-Prime of the Government of Moscow, and the Vice-Prime of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Mena was governor of the province of Ivanov.
The owners of lembard in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class has difficulties
At the Bendemer Trade Center in Singapore, Janani Amithaling is putting a gold bracelet, a ring, and a series to pay for her daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is put in there,” said Ms. Amithaling.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband are working, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where household debt is rising — has become the third hack of the Singapore stock market this week.
A security loan for jewellery is not just a quick way of getting money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amithaling), but it is almost as cheap as poor bank loans.
In Singapore, there is usually an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent over 15.4 per cent proposed in the United Oceans Bank office, a local creditor with an affiliate at the same trading centre.
However, barbarians have the advantage of not requiring tests of creditworthiness or evidence of wages and may extend loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people throughout the region are turning to crags because families feel pressure because of the higher cost of living and the rapidly increasing debt of households and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and low-cost lending, fueled by free monetary policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families resort to halobards to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, pointed to an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to increasing mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list from 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about Thailand ' s high consumer debt, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed an ongoing decline in exports and a decrease in consumer demand.
“The point is that as prices rise, people in the middle and lower [income scales] will be looking for ways to supplement their incomes where they can be, ” says Song Sung Wung, economist CIMB, Malaysian bank.
The record of high gold prices in the last two years has increased the heat with which people invest their personal belongings, as they take advantage of the opportunity to get money for their family ornaments.
In Singapore, about 70% of the things that are laid down in 200 Lombards of the city-State are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's put in a gold chain of grandmother and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest lembard operator EasyMoney observed an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in the Lombard business is such that the ValueMax, an operator of the Bendemir office and 15 others in Singapore, is not only expected to grow in neighbouring Malaysia where it has four shops, but also outside of Asia, says Yeeh Liing, Executive Director of the ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion, using 60 per cent of the S$66 million engaged this week as a result of stock shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors had been criticized for high interest rates, she said that the Lombard did not only offer cheaper tariffs than other creditors, nor did it increase debt directly.
“Centres are laying the items they already own, and the monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
It has won increased public acceptance as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
At the same time, Lombards are not limited to those who are in difficult financial circumstances.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices to set up gold flakes or Rolx hours that can bring up to 60 per cent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all levels of society.
“They include wealthy persons who need to take short-term money for commercial projects or investments or small-scale businesses that need to overcome temporary cash constraints,” said Ms. Yeeh.
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.
It is now important for the population, not the number and status of health facilities available, but the quality of the health care provided.
The modernization of the Programme for Modernization of Health in the Tulla Region for 2011-2013, the reorganization of our city's health facilities will allow for the establishment of an optimal health care system for the population, including gynaecological diseases, pregnancy and childbirth.
For example, the possibility of engaging a narrow specialist from the NKBS to consult pregnant women with different pathologists has increased further since the integration of the homogene.
During the modernization programme, the mother ' s logistics base was significantly improved, and modern equipment was introduced in line with world standards.
Over the years, some 8 million rubles have been allocated for major maintenance of premises, and 112 items of equipment worth 42 million roubles have been purchased.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
The operating caesarean section uses the Cel-Sever tool to collect blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, to return its birth, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a hospital laboratory diagnostic unit.
The Women ' s Consultation has an electronic register, and e-maps and history of patients are expected to be introduced in the near future.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible for gynaecological patients, pregnant women, and newborns to be consulted with regional specialists.
Chechnyas beat and looted 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechnya prisoners were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation had been under way since March this year.
About 60 women have been ill-treated by Caucasuss.
The bandits were reportedly ordering prostitutes in one of the Strasbourg hotels and then beating them and robbing them.
The head of the gang was 27 years old, formerly a student of Chechnya.
David Alabama's champion of Bavaria became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reports the official website of the Bundeslig.
In this dispute, he preceded winter sports, which have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was for the blizzard Marcel Hirsher, and the third was the rock on the ski with Gregor's Schlyrenzauer.
In the past season, the 21-year-old Austrians of Nigerian origin helped their team win the League of Champions, the championship and the German Cup, as well as the UFA Supercub.
Archavin's ex-wife is resting with an actor, Andrem Chadov
The former civilian wife of the Pieter Zenita footballer, Andreya Arshavin Yulia Baranovsky, spends the vacation with actor Andrem Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy with the actress Anastasia Zadroja, her fiancee is a figurer of Sergei Slawov, and an actor, Andreya Chadova.
The photos of the couple's joint walk were published at Instagram Anastasia of the Road.
It's not the first joint picture of Andre and Julia.
On 5 October, the Zamorawó released a picture on which a couple hugged themselves on the shores of the Gulf of Finland in Comarvo.
In mid-October, Andrey Arshawyn admitted to living alone from his civilian wife, Julia.
Remember, Yulia Baranovsky and Andrey Archavin had been with them since 2003, and they had three children.
It's just recently become known that Archavin meets the ex-model Alice Kazmin.
A new friend of Arsewyn was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Saving package $325 million for Tasmanian health
The Federal Government insists that a $325 million rescue package for the weakened Tasmanian health system will be supplemented by harsh conditions that guarantee that the state Government will not waste funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plybersec announced that the Commonwealth was taking “immediate measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the higher levels of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system.
The four-year funding decision was taken following consultations between the Government and the independent Tasmania Deputy, Andrew Wilki.
“The Government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which we believe will address the specific problems facing the state”, said Ms. Plybersec today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in the scheduled scheduled operations cantonment.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help to bridge the backlog.
There is also money available for pre-written clinics in Hobart and Loneston to improve the quality of care after the hospital, to train health professionals, mental health services and to introduce personal e-medical maps in local hospitals.
“These investments will take place in the ideas put forward by the leading doctors on how best to help Tasmania's health system,” said Ms. Plybersec.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian Government would work under strict accountability and accountability.
The State would need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth money and to report on a monthly basis on the extent to which it was spending the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the state provides the services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would not decide, “unless they are followed by a genuine reform that will make Tasmania's health system more sustainable”.
He commended the Government, however, for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he had first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal package will contribute significantly to the withdrawal of the state's health care system from a critical state”, said Mr. Wilki.
According to the State Government, these additional sample procedures greatly offset recent cuts.
But the Federal Opposition Representative for Health, Peter Datton, believes that today's statement is “a decision similar to a leoplastist”.
“The reason we're here is that the Labour Government of the state has taken $430 million out of health care, ” he said to ABC TV.
When the state government gives up nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it cannot be pretended to be good news.
Mr. Datton asked Ms. Plybersec to guarantee that no dollar in the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucraticity.
Guillaume Nicklu's novel, Denis Diedro, may boast of exceptional position and historical details, but it is also more taken than it should have been.
The film that takes place in France in the 1760s tells the grim story of Susanna, a young aristocratic sent to his family's monastery.
When she begins to rebel, she is extremely cruel at the hands of her sadistic mother and becomes the target of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to a crucifixion or sensation, and that's the whole problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, an edifice risks becoming a test of a kind of stork and for an audience.
Syria has destroyed its means of manufacturing chemical weapons, says the observation team.
Syria destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical and gas-producing weapons, and declared on Thursday an international monitoring group, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near a facility where toxic substances were believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian group of activists stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
A declaration by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November, established by this Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or “inefficient” all chemical weapons production tools and mechanisms to mix chemicals with the extraction of gas and to fill their ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially an initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable designed to destroy all Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus is yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during the violent fighting on Thursday in Safira, where experts believed that there was a chemical weapons facility and its storage site, reporting to the Syrian-based Centre for Human Rights in Britain.
A group of activists who had been monitoring losses through a network of activists in Syria claimed that 120,296 people had been killed on Thursday.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government ' s part, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of President Bashar Assad ' s armed forces, 18,678 were pro-Government fighters and 187 Hezbollah ' s Lebanese militants.
Also among the victims, as stated in the statement, were 2,022 army conquerors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to a United Nations assessment dated 25 July, 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought in Safira for several weeks against the rebels, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were victims on both sides on Thursday but did not provide specific data.
The fighting highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who were being driven by the short duration of their mission to rid Syria of a toxic arsenal, in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works closely with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied that it had verified and seen all critical production and mixing/refuelling equipment declared by Syria destroyed”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work, covering 21 of the 23 sites that had been declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, and the inspectors stated.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both sites were, according to Syria, “the items of the chemical weapons programme in which they are located have been moved to other declared sites that have been verified”.
It was not possible to ascertain immediately whether the Safira site was one of the two sites that the OPCW inspectors had been unable to visit.
Syria presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you all demonstrated in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director General of the Monitoring Group, Achmet Uzümj, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For the third year, civil war has been faced by rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad Government and its security forces, who are members of its alavit sect, the response of Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of the Rami Abdurrahman centre said that there was a strong explosion on the air at an air defence facility in the coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Opposed by the organizers of the faction in Bali
The remaining 202 victims of the Bali bomb in 2002 responded angrily to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators who had been tried and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years in the run-by like one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in the creation of explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He may be released within 15 years if he is granted parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass killings as a result of the attack on two night clubs in the popular Kuta tourism area, during which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist-related accusations, including the explosion of churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, even though they could insist that a person called by a “subversion” for his reputation as an explosive maker should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of a mother from Perth June Court who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist carried out by Patek and his associates almost ten years ago.
She said that she had to be sentenced to death by Pakek.
“I really think he should be following the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad,” Ms. Cortin AAP said.
“I have to live every day knowing that I have no grandchildren and that I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device in a parked van was launched immediately after 11 a.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Peddy bar, where the suicide bomber blew up an explosives bag just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma and a “deader” three times for a month while he was involved in a life-saving system.
Mr. Hughes said that Pakek should share the participation of three other members of the terrorist cell, Jima Islamia, responsible for the massacre — Amozi, Mullas and Imam Satoro — who had been executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.
Patek is the last of the parties to the Bali terrorist attack brought before the court.
He had been hiding for almost ten years, but had finally been arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces had killed the former head of Al-Qaida, Usama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI revealed that the intelligence records had been evidence: Patek had been in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He hasn't given up," Mrs. Cortin said.
Until recently, he had not regretted at all how much he had caused to others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attack, to be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be many tears this year,” said Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAH: “Early passengers can now use the fables on planes (but do not call from mobile phones)”
Airways can use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play, watch movies, and listen to music but not speak on mobile phones — according to the long - awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Authority.
But passengers don't have to expect change to happen immediately.
As soon as this change is realized, it will vary depending on the airline, said the FAU administrator, Michael Weert, at a press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAH how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for crew members and the placement rules to comply with the new guidelines.
FAH stated that it had already obtained plans from some airlines to expand the use of laptop electronics in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among airlines that had already submitted plans.
“According to the state of the plan, we could approve the increased use of electronic devices very soon,” stated FAH.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door is closed.
They must not restart them until the aircraft reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gets "good."
Passengers must turn their devices off again when the aircraft is falling to land and do not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected against electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, FAH stated.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Travellers, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve it), it will be a win-win option,” said Glading.
We have been very tired of feeling “good at school” when it comes to this issue.
But connection to the Internet for surfing, the exchange of e - mails, text messages, or data downloads will still be prohibited at less than 10,000 feet, reports the agency.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices into aircraft mode.
Thus, no Word with Friends, an intellectual Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his 2011 smartphone, in which case the actor was removed from the American Airlines airline for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was on landing.
More heavy equipment, such as laptops, will still have to be placed in the baggage compartment, as they can hurt someone if they fly all over the cabin.
The mobile phone calls in flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The Federal Liaison Commission, not FAH, has regulatory authority over telephone calls.
FAH may remove the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Council for Transport Security, the national transport safety expert CBS News, stated that cellular phones were still considered a risk.
“Court phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with the navigation devices, but we know, thanks to the FICS, that they can interfere with cellular communications towers when the plane is in midair,” said Rosenker.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee set up by FAU to study this issue recommended, last month, that the Government permit the wider use of personal electronics.
In recent years, FAUs have been put under pressure to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator, Clare McCaskil, argue that there are no major security reasons for the ban.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that one third of passengers lose or ignore instructions to turn their devices off.
FAH began limiting the use of electronics by passengers in 1966 to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers, high-tech reports of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAH as resistant to electronic disturbances.
The airline has been offering the use of Wi-Fi at a cruise height for several years.
Fixed for Wi-Fi systems is also more resistant to disturbance.
The vast majority of liners are equipped to make greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said West.
Today ' s electronic devices typically emit radio signals at a much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit only minimum signals when pages are cross-paged.
But the signals become stronger when the devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic goods by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, a company loaded an entire airliner with their e-books and flew on Kindle to check for problems, without ever finding them.
The members of the Advisory Committee of FAH expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices represented any risk.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Association of Air Passengers, said that it was considered to be real, even if the risk was minimized.
Other members of the committee said that there were only individual reports of pilots confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAH allow pilots to request passengers to deactivate the devices during instrumentation under reduced visibility.
The tourist industry team welcomed these developments, calling them a healthy step towards meeting passengers who are now using many devices.
“We are glad that FAUs recognize that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security, ” said Roger Dow, Director General of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to carry out driving tests
Drivers can be used by private companies with their own computerized motor vehicle.
This is referred to by the Commmersant in reference to the draft Government Regulation “On the tolerance for driving”.
According to the newspaper, at present there are only about 30 such automobiles in Russia.
The results of the internal testing are expected to be taken into account by the pupils of such “acquired” motor schools.
In so doing, the Public Administration will monitor the examination every six months.
If it is found that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical examinations and more than 20 per cent of the course of study are not given the first place, the school will be denied six months ' privileges.
The technical requirements for motor vehicles contained in the draft Regulation of the Government shall enter into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also requires the training of two-wheeled vehicles.
As from 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will be required to pass an urban check.
Also, as of 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will be required to obtain Russian rights after the examination has been completed.
A bird thrown by air to a safe place from a drilling plant in the North Sea is released back to wildlife
A bird thrown over the sea after found exhausted on a oil tower in the North Sea was released back to the wild.
The trap was placed in a helicopter headed for Aberdin last month and then delivered by the Scottish Animal Abuse Prevention Society (SPCA) at a rescue centre in Spain.
The manager of the centre of Colin Seddon said, "This water pasture is likely to be a winter northern European migrant who has entered the zone of strong winds over the North Sea."
It seems that the bird was ossilated and was able to find refuge on a high ground.
He added: "She was unable to take off again, so they asked us for help."
The water paste was healthy and in good condition by the time it was released.
Is the elite of Europe prepared to do business with England?
The Business for British was launched in April with an obligation to bring business representatives together and determine what changes British wealth and employment creators want to see in relation to the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to speak about the British, the business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing a wide range of businesses in Britain in size, sectors and regions.
The findings of the survey will be surprising to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently seeking export opportunities outside Europe, with special emphasis on modernization and growth, while EU countries are stagnant.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade linkages with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than waste time on a long and difficult EU institution reform process.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antimonopoly to product laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general frustration with a single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the advantages of being in Europe’s trade zone — even 40 per cent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European-based of all companies.
The last and most significant, our survey of business leaders, revealed that the apparent majority wanted the United Kingdom to pursue a trade-based, trade-based relationship with the EU rather than politics.
This result, which was seen among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on “significant change”, which will return authority to Britain.
High - achieving changes in the contract and better conditions for the British will result in a 16 per cent vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: the interview shows that the British business supports his plan to renegotiate the conditions of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that business expects that revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to the UK.
The best conditions for British business are possible and becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the United Kingdom, and, as our survey shows, for the business, that means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's regulatory activities.

New documents from Edward Snouden's collection indicate that the U.S. intelligence was listening to all of the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now strongly supervises Pope Francis.
His phone started to audition before he became head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was also monitored.
What was of particular importance in the United States.
They joined the cell phones of cardinals who gathered in Rome to select another pope.
The residence telephones where the convoy participants lived were also listened.
The American spies listened to all the chief candidates on the papal throne to prevent the appearance of a Washington-based figure.
Panorama reports that the big ear of the United States continued to intercept prelate conversations until the conclusion of the 12 March round.
In the United States, it is alleged that since 2005, the Argentine Archbishop Bergolio has been appointed Pope of Rome as the future of the Pope.
American intelligence was also involved in negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine reports that the U.S. Embassy in Rome continues to operate a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives who are receiving information on policy and financial flows.
The Vatican, in its turn, has declared that it doesn't care about the American bug, even if that's what's happening.
The U.S. leadership has no secrets for the holy fathers.
The Olympian snowboarder was specially photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a memorable note on Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held in this winter.
The currency nominal is 100 roubles.
But bloggers are already very active on the network with regard to a memorable note.
After the presentation of the Olympic bills on 30 October, they drew attention to the fact that the image of the snowboarder from the bank notes could be found in the photobanks.
In particular, in a free photo repository of StockExchange, where the photo is dated in 2005.
The same photograph is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian web site Megabzor on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in an advertisement for RugoGear smartphones.
The Olympics have been implemented in the blue and blue gamma.
On the one hand is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, and on the other, a species of the Olympic stadium and the Jar-petz.
The bank designer is Pavel Bushev, who won a competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts of Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered, such as mining, fritile and tramplin jumps, but ended up with a snowboard because it's a relatively young sport.
According to the source of Izvestium, close to the CB, the regulator is not indifferent to the public's perception of the widespread distribution of the image of the Olympian banker and is now investigating the situation.
But in Gonick, there's not too much concern about the olympian bank notes.
The head of the press service, the State Secretary of Natalia Nikiphorov, told the Iziedov that all the thoughts about the plagiate were funny.
The banker's going to turn to the right, the photos on the Internet to the left, and clarified Nikiphorus.
The person on the photo session was filmed from different locations, and then the final image was chosen, which is a symbol outside the snowboard.
It also noted that copyright laws were not applicable to the Olympic bank note because the artist had been paid for his work.
In the opinion of the experts, the debate over images in the Olympic market was very positive.
The awareness of the images on the market - plus to advance them - is determined by Alexei Popović, Executive Director of the RusBrend.
To prove the 100 per cent similarity between images on the sale and in the photobanks, it is difficult to challenge intellectual property, so it is unlikely that this image will be sued.
The first Olympic bills appeared in China, the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 issued a memorial note in 10 Yuan.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
The legislative prohibitions forced the Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
Their suggestion was that the consumption of beer in the country would remain at the same level next year, and that at best.
Even though the businessmen originally had an expectation of growth.
After all, the current year is not good for them, with a 7 per cent drop in sales.
All of this was reported by the head of one of the country's largest brewing companies, the President of the Council of the Union of Russian brewers, Isaac Scheps, at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute of Daily Demands in Russia, which has just ended in Moscow.
Public market regulation was discussed.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market had already fallen by 18 per cent, as in recent years there had been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in relation to the production and trafficking of beer, a drink with a small alcohol content, and had informed Cheeps.
No country in the world has been so severely restricted by the beer market, an unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions that are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The Pywovara observed that many legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing alcohol abuse were not particularly influential, but new initiatives were constantly emerging.
Smilk on beer manufacturers has been hit by a ban on the sale of coffee alcohol since this year.
"We've lost 35,000 consumers right away," Isaac Schaps said.
The brewers have two forecasts for the next year.
Optimistic is the one Sheps said: sales of drunk drinks will remain at the same level.
Pessimist, it's going to drop by another 2-3 percent.
To keep their profits, businessmen have to leave the mass consumer class to drink less, but it is more expensive.
However, the radical consequences of a falling sales industry with a small number of alcohols are not yet evident.
"The level of alcoholism remains about the same, according to my observation,," said Dr. Alexei Sotnikov.
True, the percentage of patients who use hard drinks, as well as those who are alcohol-based alcoholics, such as Jaguar, has grown, while it was alcohol that dominated ten years ago.
In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford car factory in All-Wojvosk.
All those who were dismissed were said to have received compensation, according to the trade unions.
However, much faster than the workers ' problems, the issue of the reduction of production in the region is a matter of reduction.
A district official, Zach Sa Alexey Atmanov, stated at the meeting that some 600 people had been cut off at the Ford factory in All-Whone-Whook.
He said that it was still in September that about 600 people had left the factory on a voluntary dismissal programme that had been developed with a trade union.
Workers who chose to resign on their own behalf were offered several salaries in gold umbrellas.
As a result, the vast majority have left jobs of their own volition.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a complete night shift.
I don't think that's gonna be a big deal.
However, in the next two years, the authorities have not planned to adopt any programmes to support the difficult regional enterprises,” he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the Government does not take into account the regional production freeze and the large decline in jobs.
At Ford, this information is neither refuted nor corroborated.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it's released, we're going to publish it.
Departure talks at the Forda plant have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to fire 600 people were known in September.
The plant had previously declared a suspension in the manufacture of cars.
The factory was called the decline in the demand for Ford's cars in Russia.
According to Petrstat, industrial production in Lenoblast has declined by 5.4 per cent since nine months in 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile aircraft would be available during take-off and landing
New regulations for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing have been approved in the United States, reports BBC.
The United States airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and the new rules will be in effect by the end of 2013.
Nevertheless, Internet connectivity for receiving and sending e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Because of the danger of interference with radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be banned.
Thus, airline passengers will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other things, and watch videos over internal and international flights.
Before the regulations are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the estimated effects of mobile aircraft on aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to the source, for example, in the United States, existing standards for the use of electronic devices in flight may also be revised in Britain.
The "rusan mob" in the U.S. has finally established a new name, the "Bratcian Circle."
This week, the black list of the "rusan mob" in America has been replaced by new names and four companies.
The U.S. Finance Department introduced three Russian, two Uzbek and Israeli representatives into the “Bratsk Circle”.
One of the Russians was a prominent singer, Gregory Leps, who is suspected of transporting money for group members in the United States.
A total of 22 people involved in the “Brata Circle” and six affiliated organizations are on the United States black list.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization exists.
“The “Brata Round” is more of an attempt to bring together scattered criminal groups”, stated earlier by the organized crime expert and New York University professor Mark Galeotti.
In his view, the Bratch Circle reflects the popular perception of the Russian mob.
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anyone else who confirms the existence of such a criminal organization”, quotes Mr. Galeotti as the United States Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti is also in agreement with Professor George Mason Liz Shelly of the University.
“If they act together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” she refers to the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Brata Circle” brings together a more close Russian foe in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Father Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, the activities of Lashi Shushanawi and Zahariah Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Father Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, came from Father Hassan as a nephew.
Mr. Galeotti nevertheless noted that some individuals were not relevant to Ussian.
In his view, they all shared more common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, there was a scandal about the inclusion in the "Brat circle" of Gregory Leps, a favorite singer of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Of course, we expect more information from our American partner partners, so that it was decided why he was placed on such lists, said the Secretary-General of the Head of State, Dmitri Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Like all FM citizens, its interests will be protected.
Head Gasprom Alexey Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sphere
The launch of the fuel pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launching of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, as stated by the head of Gasprom.
“There has been a sign today: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the ‘South Flow’ gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” said President Gasprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
The “South flow” is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The contract between Gasprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains most of the gas from Russia for Europe, increases the risk to conventional routes, says officials.
Miller stated that the direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been eliminated “at all times”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South at a reduced price as soon as the entire project begins to work in 2015.
Gasprom stated that the construction should start in other countries along the gas pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were injured, and their leg was lit.
Medical treatment provided the woman with the first medical care in the local area, and the hospitalization was refused.
Emergency medical officers also examined all other passengers.
With the help of the crane, the bus was picked up and the driver of the bus was released, whose leg was stuck at the door of the bus.

Police arrested the suspect at L.A. Airport.
It was previously known that a rifle shot had been opened in one of the airport terminals.
The police and rescue services evacuated the people from the building.
The attacker was wounded in shooting with the police, and there is no information about his identity.
The police are looking for his possible accomplices.
It is likely that several people were injured during the shooting.

Two YMCA officers were charged with sexual offences even before charges against Jonathan Lord became known to the Royal Commission
Two YMCCA NSW officers were charged with sexual offences against children prior to indictments in 2011 against an employee of a childcare institution in Karingbacha Jonathan Lord, who reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse against Children.
But in its opening statement, the Commission stated that it had “never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director of Philippe Hayra was asked about one case where an YMCA employee was accused of child pornography offences and another case where a YMCA gymnastics instructor, Caringbach Hall, was convicted of sexual offences against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayre told Gail Fernness, the lawyer assisting the commission that he knew of the first case, but did not know about the second case.
He acknowledged that YMCCA in its introductory speech had also been inaccurate, claiming that “there had been external verifications of YMCA, recognizing that YMCA was at the forefront of child safety”.
The evidence before the Commission indicates that YMCA was informed that it received the second, from the end, of the four possible quality audit evaluations performed by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hayr, who had entered YMCA when he was 21, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed, hired Lord and failed to provide a clear understanding of their obligations to report violations of children ' s security policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys during his two years of work in YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Heir rejected the assumption that the corporate ethics of YMCA had prevented staff from reporting Lord's violations of child security.
Staff testified that they had witnessed violations, including the fact that Lord had been alone with the children, had personally taken care of them, had held them on his knees, said that he loved one of them and had allowed them to play with their mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under the leadership of Lord and asked her to teach her how to protect her children because she was concerned about his behaviour, showed that she had found Jackie Barnet, a care manager for children at YMCA in Karingbach, who was leader of Lord, “very frightening and often difficult to approach”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept an explanation from staff that they were reluctant to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord led them away from the idea of the need to report him.
Mr. Heir said that he had presented his opinion to the New South Wales YMCCA Board that the lesson for the organization from “an incident with Jonathan Lord” was not “required” by the staff members and the Board agreed to it.
Mr. Hayr stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the indictments had been made by the Director-General of YMCA for the custody of the children, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was meant to prevent a breakdown of evidence, but it was “solved” and the decision was ill-realized.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not safe for children while Jonathan Lord was there during the period 2009-2011, and reported to the Commission by Professor Stephen Smolboun of Griffith University.
He said that there were “serious issues” in recruitment, selection, training, training and monitoring.
The hearing is postponed until 20 December.
São Paulo fashion week.
It's not just a dummy in the home but a real star.
Despite the fact that Gisel Bundschen left her job for some time, being distracted to her motherhood, she arrived on a special trip these days and this week the dephile.

Life remains the highest-paid supermodel of the world.
This time, she's been in the dephylique of the Cinderella.
The fashion week's finals are usually the most interesting shows.
Like the one that organized Stephen Villawentura.
Marke for more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of the pre-a-port of the class of lux, the designer works actively in theatre and film, producing plays and making costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, over 30,000 firms and companies involved in the textile industry and the fashion world participated in the final week of the fashion in São Paulo.

Tony Blair said that he would take advantage of the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admitted that return was unlikely.
On the eve of an interview on the fifth anniversary of the resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
After ten years as leader, Blair had largely avoided the debate on British policy since his resignation in June 2007, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the Quartet of Middle East peacekeepers.
In reply to a question whether he would return to the position of Prime Minister Blair, according to London’s Eventing Standard, said: “Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ...”
Massiliano Allegry, chief coach of Milan, deplored the score of nothing in the 10th class of the Italian championship with Lacio.
The specialist also noted that startup failures were caused by a series of injuries from the top players.
I'm very sorry we couldn't win, bringing Tmw Allegry's words.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 opportunities.
We didn't let Lacio do anything in the first time.
In the second Romans, we've been added, but in general, I can't say that we've lost concentration.
We had to win.
During the past season, we met the challenge of getting into the Champion League.
We are on track now, but this is due to a series of injuries from key football players.
Rami and Honda?
These are very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Take a look at the case of Kaka, who held the high-level meeting.
Conportation experts from Cardiff knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for Fenton Kirklind's three-year-old.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months earlier, this kid with his drinker, the Shetland Pony, was buffeted in three tours to take the main prize easily, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This unique pair — the same growth — was highly valued for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual Sannibenca Contest Center in Rorri, near Cardiffa.
Upon reaching the horizon of the men and women in the luxuriant kettle hats, he cut his cap and proudly held Toffa around the two-year-olds.
The judges praised Fenton for his not-for-the-year-old innate horse management skills.
And Toffy got a high score for the appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffy on his third birthday last March, and since then he has been with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffie are beautiful duets."
They had lots of rivals, but these two left with a golden cup and a chili.
That was just his second statement to Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Very unfamiliar people in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture of it.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, in the vicinity of Abb Valley in South Wales, walks through the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been putting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “All the public was hurt, and everyone was shouting praises and boys.”
He ran along the sand throughout the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did his work perfectly.
Fenton loves horses, tractors, and farms without the intelligence of animals, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Based on how he started, he would soon be taking part in the Loshadi Year, and I am sure that he will act well.
The representative of this annual final exhibition said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony."
They're a great team together.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and how they presented themselves at the show ring.
They appreciate the smoothness of the pony and the manufacturer, Fenton and Toffie, were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton helped his attractive look, he was really good at his role.
A public call for a Chinese newspaper to “reorganize”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued at the front row an appeal for the release of the accused in the reporter's libel, must be reorganized and reported to the press regulator.
The Guangzhou newspaper, The New Express, made a sudden public declaration requesting the release of journalist Chen Jung Yunch.
But Mr. Chen later confessed on television that he bribed for writing false articles about a company with State ownership.
The “New Express” is now due to go through a “complete error correction process”, as the regulator reports.
An order for “error management” came from the Guandun Office in the areas of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the Young King Evening News Group newspaper of the New Express had published several false reports about Zomlion's registered company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The guide to the New Express has been disoriented,” says the regulator’s statement.
He states that it has been decided “to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Jungzhou in the form of a revocation of his reporter license”.
He also “advised the Yangchening News Group to fully correct the errors in the New Express” and recommended that it investigate the newspaper's situation of responsible persons and immediately amend the New Express leadership.
Mr. Chen wrote a number of articles for the New Express, in which he claimed financial violations of the construction company Zomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published two appeals in the front row for his release, stating that she supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State television, recognizing that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have damaged Zomillion as well as the entire news media industry and its public confidence,” he said to the public broadcaster of CCTV.
I did this mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr. Cheng's admission, the New Express published an apology in the front row, stating that the newspaper had failed to check his reports properly.
Several high-ranking suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of beating confessions in China continues to be widespread, despite recent amendments to laws that prohibit the authorities from forcing a person to express himself.
U.S. Tunnel — Mexico for its own railway
There is one of the most complex tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, equipped with their own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel four by three feet wide as one of the most complex secret moves ever discovered.
The zigzag tunnel, with a length of nearly six football fields, links the warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with unmarked warehouses, facilitating the latent loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were transmitted to the authorities in secret.
According to judicial records, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when they found the tunnel.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officials, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
They are sentenced to imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drains.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were found in Central Mexico following the harvest of marijuana in October, which placed the drug cartels with the difficult task of quickly delivering their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of some 700 yards, which was equipped with rail routes, ranging from kitchens in a house in Tijuana to two parts of San Diego.
Belarus has seen an increase in pensions since November.
Since November of this year, there has been an increase in pensions and a report to BELTA correspondent at the General Directorate of Pensions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
As from 1 November of this year, an adjustment will be made to the average wage of employees in the Republic applied in the previous recosting of pensions, with an increase of 5.4 per cent, and a corresponding recosting of employment pensions in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the promotion of pensions.
As a result of the recosting of November, employment pensions will increase by an average of 5.3 per cent.
The average age pension is Br2 million, 295,000.
The improvement in pensions relates to 2.4 million inhabitants.
The costs of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of higher-level pensions will be increased by Br274.3 billion per month as of November this year.
In parallel with the recalculation of labour pensions in November of this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and benefits will be recalculated in conjunction with an increase in the subsistence budget, on average, per capita.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million,530 to 2.1 per cent higher than that in force from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the level of minimum employment pensions, social pensions and allowances, promotions and benefits will increase by 2.1 per cent from 1 November.

The British Police handing Assanjo notice of extradition
The British police today issued a notification of the extradition of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanja, who had fled to the Ecuador Embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yadre, they gave the Australian 40-year-old a “official demand to surrender” to appear at the police station, adding that, in the event of non-compliance, he would be further arrested.
Assanjo threatens extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after having exhausted his opportunities under British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer it to the United States, on 19 June he had fled to the Embassy of Ecuador in London and had sought political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland Yadd “has granted a formal demand to a 40-year-old man to surrender, which obliges him to come to a police station a day and a time of our choice”, as the Spokesperson had told him.
He continues to violate the conditions of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the presentation of the notification to the police.
Assangge fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible charges of espionage following the publication of over 250,000 American diplomatic depes on the Web site of WikiLeaks against secrecy.
Driver walking at 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between the legs, fined at 11,000
A car driver was fined 11,000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between the legs.
Andrew Howie, 35-year-old, from Tiptri, Essex, was observed driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 route in Brynthra on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink on his legs.
In the world court, Colchester Joui found the charge of driving without due diligence and consideration.
The addition to his driving permit of seven fines resulted in a six-month ban on driving.
The Howi has also undertaken to pay costs of ‐90 and an additional fee for assistance to victims of crime in the amount of ‐100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners will cause London’s bubble to burst
The Treasury had carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital tax but was awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborn, who, in the 2012 budget, had introduced a public duty rate of 7 per cent for homes worth more than ?2 million and annual payments for buyers who decided to own houses in partnership rather than as individuals.
To date, the tax on real estate in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas of £708 million in the 2012/13 fiscal year has already exceeded the total value of North Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Hamber combined.
Mr. Cook stated: “After the increase of public duties on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-destination legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive property is understated regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system”.
“But this step may result in some foreign investors reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners not wanting to sell it, ” he added.
The value of first-class real estate - top 5-10% of the housing market - in the rich south-west London belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savilles, prices in central London continued to show a steady increase of 5.6 per cent per year, but they were overshadowed by a growing “net market” with a surge in South-West prices, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists shed light on the way the dog’s tail moves in relation to its mood.
Early research has shown that happy dogs are put to the right by the tail (in terms of the dog), while alarm dogs wave the tail mostly to the left.
But now scientists are saying that other dog family members may notice these subtle differences in tailing and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Wallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that people on the left and right side of the brain have different roles in forming incentives that cause positive or negative emotions.
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
He added that, like humans, dogs have a right-wing part of the brain that controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotion.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the multitasking of the tails of other dogs, researchers observed animals when they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analysed their behavior.
Maybe soon we'll see why their tails are sometimes headed one way or sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs a video of dogs, either naturalist versions or silhouettes, to get rid of any other distortion, and we could manipulate the tail and send the tail more to the left or the right.”
When the animals saw that in the rest nothing more than the unexplaining dog moved its tail to the right (in view of the tail of the dog), they remained quite relaxed.
But when they saw that the tail was inclined toward the left (new from the point of view of the tail of the dog), their heart was trained and they looked troubled.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience of what movements they should be concerned about and not about.
He observes: “If there are several encounters with other dogs and often their tails in one direction is more friendly, and the right side is less friendly, the dog responds on the basis of this experience.”
The researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal emotions.
A dog behavior expert, John Bradshaw, invited by a scientist at a British University veterinary school, said that it was not the first study to check whether the lion and the right were relevant to the dogs.
Last year a team of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left if they looked at the aggressive dog and to the right if they looked at the dogs.
In another scientific work at Victorian University in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was pointed to the left instead of to the right, rather than to become alarmed — the opposite of Italian research.”
He said that differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robots as dogs.
A useful study of how dogs respond to real dogs could be explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified, and the dog is not an exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered, we will probably soon understand why their tails are sometimes headed in one direction and sometimes in the other.
The Archatic Monkeys are postponing a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's disease
The Rock Group Archic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her larynx was diagnosed.
The Chief of Staff was to speak at Hidro City concert yard on Friday.

This statement of the group was made after she was forced to postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, the Archic Monkeys reported: “After the decision to transfer the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after the request for medical assistance, Arcic Monkeys should also postpone the show on the Hidro site in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November”.
“Alexa Turner was diagnosed with laringit” and unfortunately he is unable to speak.”

Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February.
Pope Francis will raise the Catholic Church’s new cardinals for the first time in his service on 22 February, as he announced on Thursday Vatican.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who choose the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately be involved in the choice of his successor.
There are 201 cardinals.
However, once he reached the age of 80, he was no longer able to take part in the pope's election, which was the prerogative of the group of 120 “Criminal electors”.
Announced this news, the Vatican press secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a meeting of all the current cardinals, known as the Constitution, would be held before the sanctuary.
“Papa Francis decided to report in advance his decision to convene a consultation in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from different parts of the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero, of Catholic Voices, said that the number of electoral cardinals was likely to decline to February.
He said that, in general, the pope calls as many cardinals as it takes to bring the number of voters back to 120, as well as so many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
Concession next year will be important, because it will be the first ever since Francis was elected in March this year, according to Walero.
At present, there is a kind of bias in Europe, and particularly in Italy's favour.
“It would be interesting to see whether a new pope would appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he noted.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first cardinals chosen since the formation of the French Council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, to seek ways of reforming the church.
In the past, Dad made his own decision.
“Now Francis has selected eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said it was possible that Francis would refer to cardinals for advice.
But we were not in this situation before — all for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually the cardinal of bishops from major arrivals, but Francis “the sex of surprises — we do not know who he will call”.
GM removes a number of new pickups in the U.S. to finalize the seat backs
General Motors Co withdraws nearly 19,000 completely new Chevrolet Silverdo and GMC Sira model 2014 to address problems with manual seat back adjustment, in accordance with the Friday notification from U.S. regulatory authorities in the area of road safety.
On some peaks the front seat may have a defect in the back inclination mechanism.
As a result of the back of the seat, the seat does not comply with the federal safety standards of the head restraints.
“At the rear of the car, the head restraint may fail to provide adequate protection to the driver and passengers by increasing the risk of injury” on the website of the National Road Safety Administration.
These models were developed between 1 August and 10 September.
The issuance of the GM picks up in June and represents the most important launch of the car into serial production for a leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring because of bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed pictorial owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Traffic Safety Administration could not consider the notification to the owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the increase in the sale of cars in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pick-ups that were upgraded for the 2014 model series grew by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as the GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pick-ups and 16,503 pick-ups.
The GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 per cent on Friday day to the mark of $37.47.
Obama’s Selector’s Cry of Desperity
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed Republicans to be curbed with commendable efforts.
Exemption cannot justify problems with the Obama-reformed health system website, unmanned attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard University School of Medicine.
I read this terrible book these days.
I thought that this book would encourage me during my second year of study in medical science and give me a feeling of hope.
It's called "Distance to Win", and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients tonight, and I go to bed, this book is giving me back when politics inspired millions of people, and performances could take over the spirit.
The election victory was impressive, and the leading news programmes paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates cried for joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategies was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time Obama took office in 2008, the support rate was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
The return is now a rude awakening, like an uprooting dream.
It is hard to recall these moments of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
Over the years since I dropped down my first ballot, the changes have really happened.
It was something I couldn't imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on accessible medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the rule “Don't ask, don't say,” the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party-disciplineism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of public health choice, and the closure of the Guantánamo base among others.
But after a number of times I was on the side of Obama's administration, defending her in front of my colleagues and peers, I ended up with explanations that I could provide.
I have reached the point of political despair.
The educationalism of the Republicans cannot explain foreign leaders' permission or strikes by drones on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the privacy of Americans by the National Security Agency or the harassment of whistle-blowers who reveal the Government ' s misconduct.
He could not explain the killing of an American citizen, Anwar al-Avlaki, without trial or investigation, or the non-compliance of State funding and expenditure limits during presidential campaigns.
He could not justify the findings of the report, which stated that the efforts of the White House to silence the media were “the most aggressive ... ever since Nixon's time”.
More recently, it cannot justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the Access to Health Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Did I have to understand at the age of 18 that leadership could run counter to the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is clear that the election is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by random events, such as the beatings in Newton.
Nevertheless, all the examples I have mentioned above show that they were largely a choice of administration.
And that's what bothers me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthralled with enthusiasm for his candidature.
Mitt Romney was an unclear and harsh alternative, and it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I thought that, in my second term, Obama, free of the pressure of future elections, would meet the hopes we had heard for so long.
However, when Obama’s score dropped below 45% this week, returning to 2008, through this book, was much more difficult.
This makes me trample on many of the promises that have gone away.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton defeated Obama in the primary Pennsylvania elections.
In a meeting on the causes of failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
“I want us to return our attractiveness, ” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I agree with you completely.
The views expressed in this commentary belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbot has a conflict of interest on child-care leave.
The donor billioner, Clive Palmer, said that Prime Minister Tony Abbot had a conflict of interest on the issue of parental leave because his daughters could be pregnant and benefited from it.
That mining magnet, which had an unresolved carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made that statement while he was trying to fend off the question of whether he had a conflict.
A joint Palmer Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be critical in deciding to eliminate carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be with ministers and said that Mr. Abbot ' s daughter would personally benefit from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because any of these daughters will have a direct interest in whether they will be given leave or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the fight for a seat from the Sanshain Coast of the Ferfachs Electoral District, with a balance of 53 votes after the conversion of the vote.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the counting of votes in elections to accelerate the process.
Tony Abbot Francis and Bridt's daughters.
Should a decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
“We need to have a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system that could be able to come in, put our data into the computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 6:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for marking in the ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone does not like it?
The use of pencils in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is investigating opportunities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sanshayn Cost and would be “very serious” in his new work.
Public office involves service to the community.
“We are not seeking any reward other than thanks to history, for at a critical moment we can serve this district,” he said.
RBS removes two currency tenders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its currency unit, according to two people who are aware of the situation, which confirms that global scrutiny by the regulators of the expected currency market manipulations is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed their cooperation with regulators in the investigations of the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS officers to be excluded from the unfolding investigation, which is echoed by the LIBOR interbank manipulation scandal.
In refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulatory authorities this month.
“Our ongoing investigation of this issue continues, and we are cooperating fully with FCA and our other regulators”, reported to the bank two weeks ago.
In the past month, informed persons said that RBS had transmitted the e-mail and the instant messages it had received and sent to the former trader of the British Financial Control Authority, the Financial Action Agency (FACA).
This trainer, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010, and he is known to have been granted leave for his current European currency exchange manager position in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European shopping mall at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former senior currency traders at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by the Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
The contact group of Mr. Asher included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed individuals.
UBS reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss Governor Finma said that he was investigating alleged currency manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world — the European Commission, Finna, Swiss Antimonopo, FCA, the United States Department of Justice and Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have agreed to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also initiated internal checks or requests for information from regulators were made by persons familiar with the situation.
The banks were looking for instant messages and e-mails in a few years to find cases of offences.
Renews on verifications have taken root in activities that have been one of the largest sources of income of investment bank trading units in recent years, but this year, however, have encountered difficulties because of the low volatility of currencies lowers the favourable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation by saying that a large and high-lying currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say it is not always right.
According to the senior traders, despite the massive volume of daily exchange in the currency market, fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increased use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very low price”.
This news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that he had fired one of his traders from the London Stock Exchange Division this week, after he had caused almost $6 million in losses at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are sure that the traders acted alone and that this issue has been localized,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama ' s Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's Health Mark Act is constitutional, which is a major victory for Obama's administration.
In a vote of 5 v. 4, the judges ruled that the separate patient protection and health orders requiring citizens to obtain medical insurance before 2014 or a fine were constitutional in accordance with the tax authority of the Government.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, referred to the four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Skala, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2,700-country law and further held that the requirement of the Health Act that the States should improve compliance with the Mediaaid programme, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for the Medicalaid programme, was not unconstitutional.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business have filed an action to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main republican presidential candidates during the 2012 season of the primary elections, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football's the cause of the difference?
In the "Open House", policy makers and experts talked about how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the prohibition of football in the North Caucasus because the game is just a scandal and an adrift.
Singer Sergey Narishkin recalled recent events in Birwlev and said that, in order to reduce the “price of tension in society”, politicians and the media must be adapted to comment.
He probably referred to a recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinski, who threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire in one of the television programs, unless they wanted to limit fertility...
All speakers also referred to measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and to measures to harmonize relations among the people of Russia, which added to the discussion of confusion.
Max Grigorev said that the events in Birwlev were a “model conflict that could be predicted”, but that “we have too many people and institutions behind these questions”, and seven baby-in-laws with no eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe had long practiced with regard to migrants, according to the socialist, had failed, and the search for its path had to be sought.
The historian Yuri Petrov expressed great hopes for a new unified history textbook.
“There is still a need to create a cultural guide for the country's students in Tatarstan to know that they live in Daggestan, and vice versa,” he said.
Gennady Züganov proposed criminal responsibility for "Russia's Call for Dismemberment": "If the US says on the radio that you have to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and sent to 20 years' imprisonment."
Vladimir Zyrzynowski was trying very hard not to burn.
As usual, he accused journalists who bring up sick and acute national problems to a public debate: “There's little to say in the dust of the debate.”
Vladimir Vassiliev, the leader of the “Single Russia” faction, once again advised journalists to conclude a charter and to make arrangements to talk on the subject carefully, and then the same commitments can be made to themselves and to politics.
We have some 30 laws governing migration, and the general order is laid down by Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited the law that places regional and municipal authorities in charge of international peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrishenko was not happy about the Act, and there is no “clear idea that it is an adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits.
So the subjects will interpret the same amount of authority.
In addition, municipalities do not have the necessary human resources to address such complex issues, nor are there the means for them to take advantage of them, nor do they provide the centre with the guidance they need....
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliiev, proposed the establishment of a special agency with the formidable title “National Security Ministry”, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tischkov, who in the 1990s led a similar agency, subsequently abolished, opposed it.
Have at the federal level a special person, a “minister without a portfolio”, to whom you could contact, if what.
“We're going to the edge, the shells are coming together; it's very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to take a stand against provocations, and this work should be well-informed,” said the representative of the CPT for Relations with the Society of Universal Chaplin.
No State neutrality with regard to dangerous ideologies should be religious, including in its view.
Here, Oleg Nilov took the conversation to an unexpected direction, "There are more talented men than there are in Chechnya or Dagestan to search for, but they are pushed down the wrong way," he said.
"Not that road" is the development of football, "So footballers beat the whole crowd, "the flags they burn, the comrades throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that type of football?
There's another kind of sport - the rugs are called...
"They won't be happy in the world in this form of sport!"
No one will play in the Caucasus!
You'll offer them another ring.
You have to know the national characteristics, it's like offering to Georgian "Zepothera"...
In Yaroslavl, wild conduct in the rostrums was marked by the Moscow Club, during a game with a local club.
Football will have to be banned throughout the country...
The Head of the RLS Monitoring and Discipline Committee, Arthur Grigoriantz, reported that Cuba was fined 500,000 roubles, transmitting Philip PAPENKOV, from the House of Football, from the Philippe PAPENKOV correspondent.
Such sanctions against a red-headed club were applied for burning the Dagestan flag by fans in the rostrum during the 14th round of home vs Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, the human being from the EFFL.
We have studied all available materials.
Cubans have fined 500,000 roubles for their misconduct.
Nortel patent claims against Google companies, Samsung, Huwei
The group, which holds thousands of former Tuesday patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the price of which it transferred to the Tuesday bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which had purchased $4.5 billion of the Norther patents, filed claims for patent infringements at the U.S. District Court of Texas v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huwei and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents include technologies that help match key words on the Internet with their respective ads, referred to in the claim, which is the basis of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huwei, HTC and Rockstar were inaccessible and did not comment.
Samsung, Huwei and HTC are making telephones operating on the Android operating system from Google, which fiercely competes with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial $900 million price for Portel patents.
Google raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering a $4.4 billion.
After losing the Shortel Rockstar patent case, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, the transaction was partly driven by the Motorola patent library.
“In spite of the unsuccessful attempt to acquire claim patents at the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate them”, states the lawsuit.
Rockstar requires increased recovery from Google because it claims that a violation of Google patent rights is deliberate, as required by the claim.
Egypt takes the oath of the First Free President
Mohammed Mursey is taking an oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark an end to the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Morsey promised “new Egypt” when he vowed to become the first freely elected President of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who had been overthrowed 16 months ago.
In its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursey also became the first freely elected Islamist President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt, after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes at a courthouse on the shore of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We seek a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” said Mursey at a ceremony on live television.
“The Egyptian people today laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old American engineer with a “Braught Muslim”, a fundamentalist group, most of which of the 84 years of its existence had been banned by an organization that had served as a target for harsh action by successive Governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Mursey arrived with a small basket shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the court building to welcome the new president, and unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak, the movement was stopped for only a short time in order to miss his convoy on a generally busy road connecting the centre of the city to the southern suburbs.
Although Mursey was ridiculed as the non-harite “security wheel” of Britev, his personal prestige has increased sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he attempted to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists but also for all those who wish to bring the 2011 revolt against authoritarian Mubarak to the end.
“Egypt today is a civilian, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Mursey, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to judges in the wooden panels of the hall, where he took an oath.
Morsey later went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to give his inauguration speech.
He was given formal treatment with an army orchestra that carried out a state hymin, during which he stood on the stand “smartly”.
A military specialist, Feldmarish Hussain Tantai, was present.
His arrival was met by the slogan “Armiah and the People — One Hand”, which scandalted hundreds of members in the principal lecture room of the university.
Founded in 1908 as part of secular education, the University of Cairo, in the 1970s, became a diplomat of Islamic student groups.
Mursey took symbolic oaths on Friday on Tahrir Square, where the rebellion that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year began and promised to restore the powers of the President, who had been deprived of his office by the military council, who had taken cases from a deposed leader.
But by agreeing to make a formal oath before the court rather than before Parliament as accepted, he is doing the will of the military, and this is a sign that the fight for power will continue.
Mursey's speech on Tahrir Square was filled with populist gestures.
Another meeting of the Tumen Engineer Association was held on the basis of the Jalutorov Motor Vehicle Plant.
As part of the event, a new line of steel electric pipe production was presented.
According to the business director, Denise Gribonov, a marketing study on the market for steel constructions in Tumen province was conducted in 2011 with the appearance of a new owner.
It turns out that the region consumes over 50,000 tons of electrical pipes per month.
It was then decided to change the factory profile and installation of equipment for the production of the plant.
Already over 7,000 tons of manufactured products have been shipped this year.
The investment in the plant was over 120 million roubles, and told Denise Gribonov.
A new state was launched in October, increasing the range.
The factory produces both a small profile of pipes, which is used for tep-lica, small-scale construction and furniture, and a large one for the construction industry.
It is planned to reach a production level of 50,000 tons per year, about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the transition to another activity, the number of staff at the enterprise has not decreased - it now stands at 157, in plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of more than 50 staff.
The enterprise is re-training and the necessary specialists are being selected from existing ones.
Next year, a new combination of longitudinal sharps of up to five millimetres is planned to be introduced, which will reduce the cost of products, as well as another state, at a rate of up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, production of pipes, which are being used in housing and utilities, is going to be completed at an enterprise.
The purpose of the enterprise is to close up to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tumen region for these products.
The Deputy Director of Investment Policy, Leonid Ostroumim, approached the production managers and encouraged greater attention to the upgrading of the engineering sector.
The forms of State support for industry are also targeted, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of their lease.
This year, 150 million roubles are allocated for this purpose, and two thirds of that amount has already been spent.
The latter, which would consider grant contracts, accepted documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget provides for the cost of local producers ' participation in international fairs.
A budget of 150 million roubles is budgeted for the coming year and can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for the acquisition of new equipment.
Five million will be allocated for participation in fairs, three million for energy conservation programmes.
Funds are reduced to 72 million roubles for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the southern Tumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonida Ostroumova, in the future, this form of support will cease as the motive for its introduction was to compensate for the mining tax that oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct spending obligations in the region.
Accordingly, the Government considers the direct support of industry to be a priority rather than financing through the oil industry.
Budgetary assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the current situation with oils.
Grants for the equipment they purchase are a competitive advantage for the southern Tumen region industry, and if they are eliminated, it will be difficult to compete at a price with the middle Russian sector, where the cheaper labour force is.
Moreover, the continuity of the new owner of the TNC-PL-RP-Rosepht, which is not yet placed on Tumen enterprises, is not a clear question.
An agreement for the implementation of the Utva Project expires in 2013 and no application for extension has been received.
At present, southern enterprises that specialize in oil and gas equipment cannot form a portfolio of purchase orders for the coming year.
It remains open to the question whether taxes will come from oil mined in the Uruguay region to the region ' s budget, or whether they will be paid at the location where the new owner is registered.
Tomić will serve 240 hours for an extremist video in a social media company
The Leninsky District Court sentenced 240 workers of the city who placed a video of extremist power on the social network to RRA Newsta on Friday, a representative of the regional court press service.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man placed a video on a popular social network on a federal list of extremist materials.
He was prosecuted under article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, “Actions aimed at inciting hatred and hostility, as well as at impairing the dignity of a person committed publicly”.
“The Lenin District Court examined the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime by imposing a penalty of 240 hours' compulsory work”, said the agency's interlocutor.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised to the Ukrainians the collapse of the price of goods after signing an association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that prices in the country will fall significantly after the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
He spoke about this when he spoke to readers of his Facebook page.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Zone provision, the customs duty to import goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices should go down.
“It's about goods coming from EU countries”, Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the effect of the price agreement would not be so direct, it would be indirect.
However, there should also be no price increases.
Thus, reports on billboards that have recently appeared in our country, that an association with the EU is an increase in prices, is not quite true, or is not, more precisely, true,” summarized Azarov.
Investigators verify information on child abuse in Biiska
On 29 October, the media reported that one of the kindergartens in Bisca had locked a child in a basement for educational purposes.
All the circumstances are being clarified by investigators and the legal evaluation of the actions of kindergarten staff is being carried out.
Evgenia Vasileva spoke after the charges of stupidity
Evgenia Vasiliev, who received close attention from the media for almost a year, has not yet commented on many publications in the press, both about thefts in and about Minoborone, and about her personal relations with the Minister of Defence, Anatolym Serdukov, her poetry and her passion for valuable things.
On 1 November, however, a figure of the Defense Service case violated silence.
In an interview, Life News Vassileva said, "It was definitely one thing: pull any negative information against the former Defence Minister out of me."
There's been blackmailing on the point that I have to testify, or I'm going to be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Next thing we're going to court, we're gonna prove our innocence.
In victory, we're sure it's 100%.
However, an interview concluded that perhaps the most important thing was to say to Vasiliev that she did not have a taste.
There is probably a statement by the official of the SC of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that the collection of the paintings that were collected in the "Prohibition Service" case found falsifications.
Among the property arrested are a number of paintings that the host woman, confident of her deep knowledge of the art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the artifacts appointed by the investigators after the arrest of the paintings found that they had no artistic value and were simply cheap falsifications,” Markine noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from Minoborone, and they said I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss certain personal matters?
I think it's just an indiscretion," Vasiliev says.
At the same time, whether it acknowledged its guilt in one of the 12 criminal episodes in which it was involved, Vasileva said, "No, of course.
There's nothing to admit at all.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
Furthermore, in response to today's statement by the FAC that Vasiliev deviates from examining the criminal case file, the artifact's lawyer stated that he and his client “an investigator does not get to know the case file”.
What led to the revelation of the house arrester Vasileva, who still had no communication with the press?
Maybe how a woman couldn't answer the bad taste charge?
Or is it the right of Comosmolki journalists to say a couple of days ago that she's “in the way of further trance under house arrest” because of a report about the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdukov and his wife and his return to his household?
The famous military explorator Victor Baranc, in his article “Serardkov Returned to his wife”, wrote, "Sensors do not rule out that, after this shock, she can become more conversational at interrogations."
Previously, Vasileva had some allegations of illegal sale of property by Minoborna.
Pretential trouble.

The Flight Cree seems to have a reverse trend.
The company updated its full-year income forecast and looked forward to the record incomes of resters in Australia and Great Britain.
This tourism firm now expects its main full annual revenue to be between $325 and $340 million, compared with the previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current targets are achieved, that would amount to a 12-17 per cent increase compared with a record $290.4 million in 2011-2012.
The Managing Director, Graham Turner, said that Flight Cente received 8 per cent in the first half of the year and began the second half with good results, especially on one-week trips to Australia and Great Britain.
“ Since the beginning of the year, we have been engaged in profit-making for our 10 countries, some of which are expected to have a record high in the full year before the deduction of interest and tax contributions, ” he said.
- This includes Australia and Great Britain, which usually bring us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offset by a slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in Britain’s Flight Cente business, leisure was good, while corporate customers were less likely to spend.
Her business in the United States had compensated the losses sustained during the seasonally weak first half of the year and was expected to make profits for the third full year in a row.
The next day, the Fllight Cente stock rose 3 cents to a $38.20 mark.

In Ekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Ekaterinburg, the police are investigating a criminal who was brutally mistreated with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
The New Region has been reported in the FMG Press Service in Sverdlovsk province on the eve of a day in the Kyriv district of Uril, after the fire had been extinguished in a three-room apartment in Uralski Street residence, where the bodies of two women were found with violent death.
They were identified shortly after the death.
It turns out that they are sisters, one of whom is a 44-year-old resident in Yekaterinburg, and the other one is a 33-year-old resident in the territory of Orenburg.
They rented a cool apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was under the personal control of the main police region of Michael Bordin.
The internal affairs bodies have worked out various versions of the murder, and have verified the alibis of earlier convicted citizens and persons inclined to commit such acts.
In addition, the purpose of the apartment was determined for women and where they had lived before they had been involved in the activities with which they had relations.
Schools called for greater attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one of Shakespeare’s plays, 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature since 1914.
The examination will also present “external policy texts” to encourage more reading.
The joint English-language course will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to pass a separate final examination in language, with persistent recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education should issue new English and math curricula tomorrow, the first to be radically revised.
It will amend other major subjects next year.
A specific regulator in the OFQUAL examination will present the revised structure of the secondary school final examinations, with the new system of assessments and a smaller number of courses.
In the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Gove, said that there was “a broad consensus that we must reform our examination system to restore public confidence”, insisting that the school graduation examinations would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that English schools spend less time in mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a fourth) than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore students spend about 138 hours.
Although there would be no formal requirement for more time in the math schedule, the coalition sources said that large-scale math finals combined with a higher factor in the ratings table would most likely encourage schools to provide further instruction on the subject.
In the academic plan, greater attention will be given to “real-life”, including financial mathematics.
Hayheh tickets will cost tourists 2,200 roubles
Tomorrow, from Good News in Heiha, tourists will be taking air-cushed ships.
To want to go to China, that means extra costs.
Puma tickets are traditionally more expensive than heating.
The reference service for AmurasSO reported that the standard ticket would cost 2,200 roubles.
Travel through the room of increased convenience would cost 2,800 roubles.
To tell you, in this season, the tickets were not traveld: at the same price, the puma was carried by tourists and the past spring, and a year ago, by autumn.
Dmitri Medvedev: GDP growth rate is not sufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev is not enough for the Russian Federation to grow its GDP, and he is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business credit and changing the structure of the Russian economy, based on innovation, reports Reuters.
We were planning a 3% increase in GDP this year, maybe a little bit more.
It's going to be a little bit less than 2% real.
Against the backdrop of recession in a number of European countries, it seems to be not very bad, but for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and generally, there must be a higher pace to develop.
It is now very important for Russian companies, the Russian business, to receive normal loans at a normal cost, the first thing that must be done,” emphasized the head of Government.
This is the first time that Pamela Anderson has cut off her cultic light luminoses and has shown his radical new hairstyle.

A visit by dirt, river and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Beverle provides free health care in rural Cameroon
Bavelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country, doctors do not have much — just one per 5,000 people
Be voted here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Beverle is one of the 10 major heroes of CNN 2013.
You may vote for him or for any of the other 10 major heroes to become CNN's hero.
This person will get $250,000 to continue his outstanding job.
For 21 years Georges Bovelle saw his father come back to life and regained consciousness by going to hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bvelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, Cameroon’s capital.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the emerging infection spread to the brain, causing hematoma, which reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” said Georges Bwell.
If we had money, we would have taken it out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bavelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
“ It’s not easy, ” Bavelle said.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first one, but you're not the first one.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed significantly since Bavelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one physician per 5,000 in Cameroon.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one of 413 doctors.
And even if the Cameroonians could go to a doctor, many of them wouldn't be able to.
Two out of five people in that country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the health expenditure is private.
“The only problem is poverty, ” said Bavelle.
“And because of their poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bavelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bovelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital of Yaoundé.
It has also established a non-profit organization, ASCOVIME, which arranges visits to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are recruited in a van, tied to roofs of medical supplies, and traveled across the crossed area to visit the village in need.
It's not always their luck.
They often had to push cars across rivers and dirt.
But when they arrive, they are met as true heroes — a celebration with songs and dances and the best premises that the local people can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed a occasion for the celebration, and Bavelle, with his wide smile and unreserved energy, is more than happy to join in.
The crew starts taking hundreds of patients the next morning.
“We accept 500 people on each trip,” Bavelle said.
They come from the entire district at a radius of 60 kilometres from the village, and they walk.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may obtain stipends, credit cards, or free birth certificates — documents that are necessary for a school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
During the evenings, the crew conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually conducted in the school, municipality or house building; after the procedure, patients stand and go to the post-operation zone to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to cover operational and sanitary treatment of equipment, Bavelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's an untidy pace, but team dedication usually helps support village musicians.
“They've been on drums all night to keep awake and keep working, ” Bavelle said.
They go back to town on Sunday, tired but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they help.
One man explained that the free grizza treatment operation he had received would allow him to work again.
“This will change the future for me and my family, ” said a man.
In addition to these clinical check-ups on weekends and at the hospital by surgeon Bavelle, there are also night work in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second work, he said, that provided 60 per cent of the funding of his non-profit organization; the rest was financed by private donations.
“I don't even know when he's asleep, ” said Cathy O'Malley, a medical student at Dressel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bavelle group.
He's always at the hospital, or he's trying to earn money for the organization, so he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses like O'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bavelle in carrying out his tasks, it's a possibility of a practice that they'd never had at their home.
“We were able to support operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold Dr. Bvelle’s tools,” said O’Malley.
As a second-year-old student, you would never have had that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay their travel to Cameroon, often on their own with donated medications.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their food, transportation, and training pay Bavelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to the organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon forever.
For Bavelle, almost constant workload is not a difficult task.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling their father’s promise, is a wonderful thing.
“ I’m so happy when I do this job, ” Bavelle said.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing it so people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agreed to give evidence of the audition of Merkel.
The daunt of the Bundestag Hans-Cristian Strebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the discussion, the question could be questioned whether Snouden could be questioned as a witness to the GDG department of the case of a possible wiretap of the German Chancellor by United States Special Forces.
Snouden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
A meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear,' said Hans-Cristian Schrebel, who knows a lot.
And while the National Security Agency led by Kit Alexander blocked all his movements, Snouden was ready to come to Germany.
First, however, all conditions of his arrival must be clearly defined.
Meanwhile, American legislators are starting to respond to scandals around United States spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved yesterday a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the United States Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir MacKay, made this announcement at a press conference with the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ahmet Davotoglu, reporting to the BELTA correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the public administration of the two countries will cooperate everywhere and support entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves,” said Vladimir MacKay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would provide all necessary facilities and maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that a further 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, resulting in a protocol.
The Parties developed a road map of Belarusian-Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in the trade, economic and investment fields, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture and energy, as well as finding new forms and areas of interaction.
“The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am confident that the present protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey see each other as a reliable partner”, he said.
The Foreign Minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that in the negotiations the heads of foreign policy departments of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and to carry out various projects.
The exchange between Belarus and Turkey, in the opinion of the Minister, must be increased to a $1 billion figure.
Turkey was also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needed to be further developed, since there was unutilized potential in that area.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded.
As well as the necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies in the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” noted Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama declines her words about health
In the midst of a storm of criticism, President Obama went on a Friday yesterday with regard to his often repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it”.
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of a halt to the delivery of services from their providers, the Republicans have, in recent days, criticized the president for misleading American society.
Obama’s original public promise was somewhat subservient yesterday.
“Most people with health insurance that works can keep it, ” he said in a statement in Boston.
With regard to what he called “news life” regarding the termination of services, Obama encouraged Americans receiving these notices to seek other options in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, integrated health insurance plans at the same cost or even less than predicted.
“You will enjoy better conditions,” he said.
The Administration stated that it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance on their own could be forced to change plans because they were not covered by the new standards required under the Access to Health Care Act.
“Let me tell the Americans directly: you deserve the best,” said Sibelius in a speech before the Committee on Energy and Trade in House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the accessible health care law, said that the launch of the Internet sales site has been “most bad” since October.
“I’m upset and angry just like everybody else, ” she said.
“I really want your trust back.”
Cybelius, who was irritated by the phrase, was caught by the included microphone sitting behind her as an assistant at the hospital hearing yesterday's morning after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives of Billy Long, a republican of Missouri, about whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the “director” of the accessible health care law did not voluntarily give up the government-sponsored insurance scheme to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
"Rosbolt" was denied media status for a non-price dent
On 31 October, Mosgordis decided that the registration license of the Roussbalt Agency was invalid, writes Lenta.
Roskkonadzor insisted on the deprivation of media status for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
An unpleasant precedent was established: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact denying the publication the right to counter-argument.
What "Rosbolt" is.
The Public Information Agency of Rosbalt was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second regional office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
Agencies also operate in countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, “Rosbolt” has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency had been listed as the most recognized private Internet service in Russia.
At the same time, “Rosbolt” has always had a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications have been (and have so far been) notes referring to sources in law enforcement agencies.
The proximity of the publication to the power structures continued throughout the agency ' s existence.
In addition to having a broad base of sources in the various agencies, the suggestion was made that Natalie Chaplin, the wife of Victor Czerkesov, was the chairman of the project.
However, the role of Chaplina in the “Rabbolt” guide is unclear until the end, often referred to as “project manager”.
The director-general of the agency is Larissa Athonin, the editor-in-Chief, Nicholas Uljanov.
Recently, “Rosbolt” was not listed in federal media ratings, either by quote or by audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th on Russian media website attendance rate on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the Rosbalt.ru site is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), and about three million unique visitors a month.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are those of Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the King and the jesting group, the violence in Birwlev in the capital.
The conflict with Roskkonador began in July 2013, when amendments to the Act on Media entered into force that banned journalists from a non-accelerative den.
The company found prohibited lexicon in two video clips published on the website (Gigit of Krasnodar and Pussy Riot desecrated oil towers).
The rest of the parties are described differently.
Roxkonadzor, on the basis of discovered video materials, accused “Rosbolt” of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and applied to court for the license of the agency.
In “Rosbolte”, the authorities' claims were incorrect: firstly, they were not editorial materials, secondly, the mother's words were disguised in them, and thirdly, immediately after they had been warned of the video.
The agency appealed the claims of Roskcomnadzor before the World Court of Justice, and when Mosgor court took action on 22 October 2013, the proceedings were still pending.
However, 25 of the world ' s judges have already ruled against “Rosbolt”: the editor-in-chief, Nikolai Uljanov, found himself guilty of violating the Administrative Offences Code and fined 20,000 roubles, up to 10,000 each piece.
This, of course, predated the outcome of the hearing in Mosgarud - if we give up the idea that the outcome could have been predated earlier.
On 31 October, the court ruled that “Rasbotta” registration was invalid, effectively depriving the media agency of its status.
You can't say that "Rosbolt" remained alone during that confrontation.
The Agency supported the Parliament (a statement addressed to the head of Roscomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, on 10 October, was signed by 26 deputies; the paper itself was submitted at the initiative of CRC).
The President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Paul Gosev, and the head of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, Michael Fedotov, declared that the publication had been wrongly closed.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the Roskimnadzor leadership even gave him some assurance that he would not reach the end of the licence.
The “Rosbolt” court showed that there is a big question under whose jurisdiction it is safer for the media to be in Russia today.
Syria Destroyed Chemistry Equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capabilities and has recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first disarmament phase of Damascus has been completed the day before the deadline.
Before 1 November, Syria had to destroy production and other support facilities intended for the preparation of combat toxic substances for use by handing over the BBC.
The destruction of the very stockpiles of poisoning substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, poisoning substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time, to prevent the Syrian authorities from carrying out more chemistry, and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition equipment.
These productive capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent their initialization.
The following milestone, mid-November: By then, OPCW and Syrians should agree on a detailed plan to destroy already existing stockpiles of poisoning substances.
There are many questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian applications will be carefully verified by Western intelligence services.
They are willing to advise inspectors to check out if they suspect that Damascus is not fully revealed.
The United States believes that the shell was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist it's the work of the Syrian rebels.
The international community required the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached at the Russian mediation, to destroy or bring into non-working conditions all the capacity for the production of projectiles, poisoning gases and liquids and for the filling of projectiles by these substances.
Now that this phase has been reached, the next step should be the destruction of the already existing chemo-based language of the Syrian army.
It is expected that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve-paralytic toxic substances, each explosive mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in a few dozen different locations.
It requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities agree on a schedule of action to begin with, two weeks.
The OPCW Chief of Field Operations, Jerry Smith, said that his inspectors “listened personally to the destruction of the equipment”.
"They are now unable to continue producing or mixing chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found that projectile and poisoning plants were either destroyed or destroyed.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to conduct the inspection there, as stated in the document, but the equipment from there was transported and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the destruction of the chemo-producing infrastructure was “especially difficult” as it had to work in an ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but according to Smith, the time to celebrate it has not yet come before the inspectors - they were too busy.
John Kerry says, in his unprecedented recognition that the US spy “has found an unapproachable distance”
John Kerry demonstrated that the U.S. surveillance protection tactics had been mitigated by an unprecedented recognition that, in some cases, “the United States spying has found an unapproachable distance”.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barak Obama, of being “on the autopilot”, at the time of the appearance of the loud exposing of Edward Snouden on the spying of the NSA.
These leaks put the United States Government at the centre of the diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Addressing the video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, actually saw some things happening on the autopilot because it was already possible — both during World War II and during the very difficult years of the cold war — and, of course, on 11 September”.
He was then the first high - ranking member of the U.S. Government to admit that the United States spy had gone too far, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: In some cases, it has gone far beyond what is good.
The President is determined to shed light on this issue and to explain himself to the people, and he is now undertaking a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has any sense of abuse.
I assure you there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted from good motives and that his tracking operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We work in a new world where people are willing to explode.
There is a radical extremism in the world, a foolish and determined determination to kill people, to explode people and to attack Governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashing, building explosions and killing of people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, United States legislators will be sent to Europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged United States spying abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, said the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
The Senator of Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had interviewed European Parliament members and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of the disappointment at the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency.
“For the sake of national security, it is indeed important that the Europeans remain our supporters for our common anti-terrorism efforts, ” said the first-time democrat of Murphy, who chaired the Senate ' s European Affairs Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
“And I go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programmes.”
News that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe deteriorated relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures included documents published by Snouden indicating that the NSA monitored the German Mobile Phone Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Klapper, protected spying against allies as necessary and said it was customary on both sides.
Against the background of this noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit of the members of the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and of the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be made available in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
Although he stated that the purpose of the visit was to promote better relations, he said that some “cruise of the best motives” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spy programmes they had used for many years.
“As we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of the Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities,” said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should address the Middle East and Poland weekend to address the issues of hostility to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence activities.
New members of the public observatories will increase the influence of jailers
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) is in a position to approve new members of the Public Monitoring Commissions (ONCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option is adopted, the force lobbies will increase their influence.
UCP - Public structures controlling conditions in places of detention.
The case of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonida Razzev and the riots in a Russian colony - it is through the ONC that most of the resonant incidents of detention are read out.
The MNC is in the process of fighting between security defenders and paramilitarists.
In the meeting of the OP Working Group on the formation of the MNC, I suggested that the selection criteria for human rights experience be used.
"It didn't take it, and it formed the lists without producing the criteria," said Valérie Borchev.
The current President of the Moscow Observatory and the Association of Independent Observers, the all-Russian human rights defenders working on prison issues.
In the past, he had drawn up a law governing the activities of the ONC, which was a member of the "Yolk" State.
The LO Council should vote in favour of MNC formulations in 43 regions of the country.
There are fewer than 1,000 applicants in 1,800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Cabardino Balcaria, competitions were not available owing to the absence of candidates.
The PLO promises to organize the pre-calculation for vacant seats.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is one of the few commissions competitive, even though the new team will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Boršev, the current composition of the capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 members of the armed forces, while the version of the voting in the OP has changed the ratio by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to be admitted to the capital commission.
But the representative of the Boy Brotherhood, Vacheslav Kalinin, can re-enter the new membership.
He had been a member of the ONC for three years, but had never visited the prisoners.
It was in the view that the armed forces, by appointing their chairman of the ONC, could make the work of human rights defenders indecent, so human rights defenders did not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, a member of the ONC, Anton Zvetkov, head of the Russian Office, is co-ordinated by a member of the ONC, an organization that defends the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies by the street," said the RBC to the daily Anton Tsvetkov.
He denies that he lobbies for the promotion of any list of lists and says that he does not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opposition.
According to Zvetkov, he didn't even know which list is being voted on by the OP.
It considers the publication to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in the management of the domestic MNC.
Her former leaders will be dismissed because of the Copyan unrest last year.
The Public Chamber concluded that the management of the local commission had ignored the prisoners ' problems.
And here's ONC Rosovna-na-Dona can go from human rights defenders to violence.
The new list of human rights defenders in the local commission, however, turned out to be one of his opponents, even though the Federal Public Chamber had ruled him out for ethical conduct in May 2013.
The lists of the Moscow and Ukrainian Commissions Boards of Borchev consider Copisk a “place for Copisk”.
The disclosures of the Hopes of Tolokonkov have not affected the MNC of Mordiya, which is considered "forced": only one human rights defender wanted to enter the new team, and she has not even accepted the documents for the competition.
PLP member Nicolai Swanidze told RBC that he had voted against the proposed list because he was resentful of the situation in Moscow and in Rosov-na-Donu.
He sent out his position to the other members of the Board.
His PLP colleague, Paul Guss, said that he voted for it because he liked the proposed Moscow list.
Co-ordinated the establishment of the JNC lists by the Under-Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, who is also a member of the FSIN Research Institute.
Grib told RBC that he did not think it right to divide candidates into human rights defenders and violenceists and did not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient authority to interfere with the work of its members.
The mushroom is not going to predict the outcome of the vote of the OP Board.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a revised version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appealing against imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for false allegations that she had been attacked by a taxi, appealed and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found by the Phuket provincial court on 15 June to be guilty of filing a false claim following a report by the Thai police that a local cabist had attacked her on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men had held her back.
However, the cameras later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after the breakup of her relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket Police questioned Bamford within two days before she confessed that she had fabricated this story.
Before the trial, she was held in the local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days ' imprisonment at the general detention centre on the outskirts of Phuketa, not at the adult women ' s prison.
She is the daughter of a former player in the Australian League of Peter Tangs who has sought assistance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for her daughter.
Tanx told Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “very concerned” about the well-being of its daughter and waited for her to return to Australia.
“It is clear that it was an alarming time, but we hope that it will return home safely as soon as possible, ” said Tanx.
Bamford appealed his conviction and was released on bail at 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her leave in the Krabi resort in southern Thailand.
The legal sources available in Thailand indicated that Bamford currently represented a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that an appeal might result in a court increasing her sentence of up to two years and ordering her to serve in adult prison.
However, following the recent killing of Australian native Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its damaged tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the presentation of his novel, Eltisheva, translated into French.
Remember, this novel was the finalist of four prizes: "Found Land", "Russky Bucker", "National Unseller," and "The Big Book."
Last year, the writer received a cultural prize from the Government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Senchin is a clear leader in the generation of the current 30-year-old and 40-year-old prosas.
Practically every publication of its hard, modern-day life stories and novels has created heated controversy among critics in a wide variety of ways.
It may be argued that the combined Senchin's Pass and Pulpitist articles, the reviews on his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the beginning of the 2010s.
In the discussions on “one of the most controversial modern writers”, according to criticism by Sergey Chuprin, it is generally said that its participants are understood by the word “licature”, as they see the present and future, not only of our words, but also of our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for most articles and reviews from the regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and overview articles are generally given in the reduction in the sections of "Absanas..."
