What's your favorite pizza stuff?
The latter view has many adherents in Japan.
Don't you think you could do that?
I don't know what I can do for you.
Tom is smart.
He's annoying.
If you go, I'll miss you.
Put the smart man on the mistake, and he'll thank you, and point out the stupid one on the mistake, and he'll hurt you.
It's a great idea.
I don't think there's anything out there.
Make your point clear.
We don't know.
Tom must have forgotten to say that to Mary.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
I'll invite Tom to dinner.
Maybe I'll do it again.
You really think I'd do that?

It's orange.
He's an atheist.
What is your aunt doing?
I was playing with a champion.
Tom warned you it might happen.
To be honest, I don't agree with you.
Mary said she believed it.
When are you leaving?
I've got a lot of friends.
I wish I could stay here forever.
After lunch, she always has time.
It covers less of the earthâ€™s surface.
I have a twin.
We begged Tom not to go there.
I think we may have been too aggressive.
You're big.
I've got some free time.
I'll help you tomorrow.
This story made me nervous.
Watch your head!
I'll miss you.
Take this.
Tom asked you to do something?

There is only one store on the whole island.
I don't think Tom knows anybody who can do this.
Tom is deeply confused.
Anyone here?
Don't call me.
It's better to die standing than to live on your knees.
Tom's waiting.
Tom likes it all.
I knew you'd wait for us.
I can't forget her.
They have chosen a new government.
Please wait five minutes.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Bring me a clean plate and take away the dirty plate.
Tom told me he was alone.
Here's the church we got married to.
I don't think Tom would be absent.
I think that makes sense.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.

What are you doing with that?
She's so hard on him.
You're such a fool!

Here you go!
Tom says he can't win.
I won't do it.
Tom didn't look offended.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
You want me to bring you a glass of water?
Tom told me he thought Mary was ugly.
She smiled at me.
You know what their actresses are.
I don't think you're callous.
It's been built forever.
He passed the exam.
Whose friend are you?
Tom's too tired to work.
Tom threw Mary the ball.
Tom's pretty persuasive, isn't he?
I miss talking to them.
He tried not to cry.

You can do this.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees it.
I was on the wrong bus.
I turned down the offer.
Mary had already done what she had to do.
I've been watching Tom.
Did you reserve the table?
Where'd the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like it.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.

I didn't think you'd understand.
Don't you recognize this man?
Like going to the picnic.

Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly accepted.
I think Tom is wrong.
You all right?
You may be the only one who can do this.
Who doesn't have a radio?
Your singing makes professional singers redhead with shame.

It is unlikely that Tom will forget how this is done.
Drink?
Tom will do this with you?
You're not asleep?
The meeting began at 5 p.m.
Mary said she liked it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary was not busy.
I was only in Tokyo once.
I got an electric bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom and I'll be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do this.
All members are required to attend.
Don't you feel comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning to do this?
We are content with the decision.

He stood in the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.

Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled that vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll bite it.
I don't want it anymore.
Do you know how she likes colors?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here today.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, I'd love to!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
Spring soon.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to think of a secret language.
Are you planning on staying for a while?
When are you planning on going to Japan?
My kids are at school.
I put my suitcase.
I'm out of the car.

He's a strange person.
I'm just jumping.

I tried to contact her.
What's she got?
How's the exam?

Who said you could do that?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is 10 minutes behind.

Prospects aren't too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm attracted to the Devil's literary pride.

I had shoes.
The next year's going to be worse.
Mary's in yellow dress.
Love has bitter taste.
The meeting was over.
You should have done that last year.

I read this story in a book.
Is Tom still wearing a bicycle?
I'll be brief.
Tom's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anybody who could do it.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in Osaka in 1997.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do that.
I hope Tom understands.
It spends too much time on the Internet.
You're beautiful.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't overdo it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's going in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car.

Do you want some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for dinner today?

When does she arrive?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.

Tom still with you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you see him often?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You'll stop.
She had been waiting for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.

He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, and the Grand Pri was broadcast there.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
English isn't my own language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the name of this girl?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So you donâ€™t have to do this again.

Why do people still smoke?
I won't work for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I am a student, and he is not.
I tried to do that.

Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new sledge.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister, Sakiko, born the same year as I, and she's getting ready for exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Did you complete your homework?
Monday will probably be a busy day.

I had to go on my own.
Please show me how it's done.
Aren't you dating anyone?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What date is today?
Where's Daddy?
Shut the door.
I'm not talking to Tom French.
Apple from the apple tree doesn't fall much.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?

Do you know whose parents they are?
She's got red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was at the jeans.
I'll see you after the play.
I'd like to ask the question.
This is my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Do you mind?
I haven't seen you forever.
You must be right.
Whose books are they?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks his dogs twice a day.
Let me look at Tom's book.
Japanâ€™s main islands are Hokkaido, Sykok, Honshu, and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.

I think we should leave now.
We didn't.
Do you think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I won't help you.
Break it up.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare with him in a tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We set up our office with computers.
We have to pay early.
Are you sure?
Do you think Tom will die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do anything you accused me of.
Please, don't be late.
I know Tom is drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book became the subject of criticism.
It'll be brilliant.
I'm really scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm under the fly.
You haven't lost your time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom witnessed in Maryâ€™s case.
I thought you were leaving.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can I ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You need to quit smoking.
I think Tom's betraying me.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Can you play violin?
Give me some salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom is good at speaking French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
It was popular for both the students and the teachers.
Tears of grief will not help.
Tom is playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom didn't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not young people like Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up the phone.
I'll be right back.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do this.
Tom is calling.
You have to tell him to do it.
He's talking at the esperanto with a little French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't do it.
She's got good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom have done that?
I hope Tom's coming to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a ladies' steward.
I'll handle it.
Have you found any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a wizard?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Fuck off.
Will you let Tom lock you?
You're a beautiful woman.
There's hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Tom actually moved to Boston?
Tom pulled out Mary's beer.

I'd like to take the money off.
I'll shake Tom's hand.
They're gonna be okay.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You don't have to worry about the exam tomorrow.
Was Tom voting?
I'll be back.
Tom wouldn't force Mary to do that.
Tom started to pull.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.

Tom still wants to come.
You can't escape.
I am Japanese, but I donâ€™t live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where have you been on vacation?
Did you get Tom's Christmas present this year?
I still miss my home a little bit, and so many things seem strange to me.
I have memory problems sometimes.
Where's Mom?
He fainted three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
We shouldn't talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Tom's okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know the reason?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little off the schedule.
Tom is not a hero.
Is it possible to catch taxis here?
Hurry or you'll be late.
It'll be complicated.
Is Tom always acting that way?
I like golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You're never lying.
Wait a minute, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It'll work, so you'll see.
She threw it away.
Tom's safe.
I eventually got the driver's license.
I'm not a student.
That's why Mary was sorry.
I'm just looking at the news right now.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's the wife?
You're right.
Tom is not rich, and Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone's late except for me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan on squeezing the boat.
The money doesn't smell.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed with your effectiveness.
Didn't you have a car before?
You were at work?
What do you teach?
I'm sorry to eat those oysters.
Hello.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
It completely ignores me.
Tom goes to the party tonight.
I told you.
She was headed for the airport.
She studies Portuguese in Brazil.
What do you tell them?
How did you know that would happen?
What is it?
If natural speech is comparable to a time - growing tree, the esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was artificially created.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's going to Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom's got a nice garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said what happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you tell him I was joking?
That's why it was terribly boring.
Tom said I was beautiful.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's excruciating.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
What do you understand?
Are they suspicious of me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take the garbage.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston map?
Your sister's always great.
It will be very difficult to do that.
The child was paralyzed from fear.
Do you like those perfumes?
How awful!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him, you should consider his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.

He knows I love him.
I don't believe it.
I was wearing a white dress.
Check again.

I know it'll be impossible.
Do you have anything to do with headaches?
Children imitate their friends, not their parents.

He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus had already gone.
Tom's in a black coat today.
I'll wait until 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're useless.
Did you try to talk to them?
It was much harder to do than I thought it was.
Her friends made fun of her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom could win.
The aliens are coming and taking away our work.
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
Are you going on a train?
Tom said Mary was beautiful.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, aren't they?
So does Boston still like it?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a medical doctor.
He's gone abroad and never came back.
Gather your toys together.
It was much harder to do than I thought it was.
I think I did well.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
So it's interesting.
Are you done yet?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not hard to do that.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you to help me?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I've never lived in Boston.
That's important to me.
That box was too heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't.
You missed something.
I immediately called Tom.
You looked interested.
That'll help.
I'm sleeping.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.

You looked sad.
Where can I rent a suit for Halloween?
Tom is busy and he can't help you right now.
We're not a couple.
You want to see a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I've got a fever.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Did Tom really think that someone was listening?
You don't need any luck!
Tom, you might say it's nice.
Anyway, I won't agree with you.
I should have left earlier.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is, solar energy is way too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a hangover.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
You understand?

Could you open the door?
Are you comfortable?

You're such a miserable person.
What's going on here?
Tom said you were speaking French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's free.
I am very interested in French.
Be good to the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight that I could lend you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't believe anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your job.
You work around here?
You admit it, don't you?
I got business tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but I grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to understanding.
I'm sharing.
The choices are obvious.
The only person Tom is talking about at all is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I don't sleep well.
Don't you buy that?
Women are good.
Wouldn't it be nice if Tom did it?
You did it?
I'm having trouble sleeping at night.
Tom sometimes gets annoyed at me.
I'm a pretty good dancer.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.

He loves tigers.
It's raining, so we can't do it.
It was extremely surreal.
These students are Koreans.
Get out of here!
What's your name?
Tom and Mary plan to retire when they're sixty-five years old.
Can I use your phone?
Your suffering makes me happy.
When did you do anything for me?
We locked the door.
There he is!
We're different.
Do Tom and Mary know?
You all right?
Don't sleep with the light on.
He's not stupider than you.
Trains in Serbia are terribly slow.
It seems to me that Tom is vicious.

Can you tell me what you're talking about?
I'm sorry I didn't tell him the truth.
He didn't dare say no to my plan.

I really want to eat.
Tom died the same year as Mary.
We went outside.
I think exams spoil education.
It's very cold.
That's why you came back from Boston, isn't it?
Did Tom believe that?
In fact, he's never been to New York.
Tom thought that Mary and John might be involved in arms smuggling.
I was sober then.
Here's your roll.
Tom was waiting for Mary.
Rio de Janeiro was founded in 1565.
I'm going to Boston with Tom.
I don't think you can do that.
First of all, you have to understand yourself.
I was there yesterday.
I'll wait here until he comes.
Tom can drive.
I read novels at random.
I was gonna tell Tom, but I forgot.
I'm a hero.
They love us.
I really need your help.
Tom betrayed you.
I got up about six.
I don't want to boast, but I'm smart enough.
Does it matter?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Tom may not even get to the team.
I ask myself if you can trust it.
What did you find?
Are you drinking?
I was angry.
When did he arrive?
Where's your ivy bear?
How you doing, Tom?
Maybe this year we're finally going to win the Europeans.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I managed to forget my wallet.
Cats catch mice.
You can go.
Tom said he wouldn't mind doing it for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I forced Tom to do it.
Why would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the earthâ€™s magnetic field with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
That's Tom's signature.
What's really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in, I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this somehow?
Do I make myself clear?
I'm free this afternoon.
Tom must be punished for doing so.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
There's no need to rush.
Are you happy?
I didn't believe him at first.
The phone's not working at this time.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Come inside.
Tom might be fined if he did.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really silly.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom said he saw John in January.
You're always getting up early, aren't you?
She always contradicts herself.
They live in the same state.
My dog's going after me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Tom's already in French.
The earth went from father to son.
There's no roses without spikes.
I hope they're not.
Don't drink too much, huh?
Wait for a surprise tonight.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He gave up his family.
Let's go?
You don't have to contact Tom.
I shaved.
I'm the boss.
Tom's good.
You have to go home by 9:00.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted he did.
Tom can't drive a car.
Tom spent that day with his daughter.
Every student has his own party.
We were ready.
I'm worried about what might be sued me.
My family lives here.
Tom is listening.
It's out of my hand.
Tom's good at speaking French.
I know I'm going to learn a lot.
I went to fishing on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
The party's over.
The uncycle has one wheel.
"Daddy, look over there, shark!" "It's a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very friendly.
I'm a botan.
I think Tom knows something.
That was my mistake, not Tom.
The meetings were pretty good.
At this time of the year, the wind is blowing from the ocean.
I saw Tom smiling.
Come on, now!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned that.
Go and beat that hooligan.
That's our car.
Hi, I'm Bashir!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I am ashamed that I did.
Do I have to go to the hospital?
In her spare time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom is singing the cants better than any other one of my friends.
He drinks a moderate quantity of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how she's dressed.
Did you see his new movie?
I'm good at this.
Why did he quit?
Tom said Mary was gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My open mind is that it's a horrible movie.
You're very elegant.
Whatever you want.
I could change.
It's substantial.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
Tom's got her.
Tom was a barefoot.
I did everything I could.
If you see a mistake, please correct it.
We tried again, but we didn't.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure if I'm willing to do it.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You have to help her.
You won't pay for any trouble.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to climb that mountain.
Tom missed lunch.
You speak good English.
He loved his parents.
Come on, I'll talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love cannot be bought.
If you didn't want to come, I had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What theater is this?
Did you see the squirrel?
Mary said Tom told her.
Tom wasn't a very good witness.
I visited my grandmother.
I hate the wedding.
I heard the front door slam.
I can't keep track of you.
Mary dances great.
My grandfather's from Oscar.
I need to relax.
Tom's so lucky.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did this.
What do you think, Tom will be here?
Tonight will be snow?
Do you like that?
Are you here seeing anyone?
I live in Milan.
When did she do anything for me?
I ate the orange.
The square root of two is an irrational number.
It's small.
Didn't you know it would happen?
Bad thoughts give birth to bad acts.
Did you bring the fen?
Tom's not wrong.
Do you have a drop from that bill?
Tom seems a bit ashamed.
We can't do without water.
I can't get my mind together.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in the village.
I would never give up.
I speak French freely.
Tom didn't waste his time.
Give me a hint.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He got very drunk.
Tom says he's satisfied.
How are you feeling now?
How many guys in your class?
It's big apples.
Choose a gift carefully.
I'm coming with her.
Why would you do something similar?
The richest man in the world could not buy his love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
Lack of news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers save us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You were in London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I'm walking slowly.
After the film, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We'll be married in June.
I wonder if Tom has left Boston.
I threw my bones.
The book lacked a few pages.
I picked up a coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks his promises.
We have to protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sara don't get along very well.
Every student has his own party.
I spent twelve hours in train.
I'll regret it.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom has no thirst.
I learned to eat the cow.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry I'm not rich.
The news really upset her.
I've got a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see it yourself.
I never killed anyone.
What's your name supposed to be?
She's holding flowers in her hand.
Have you spoken to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man's already over ninety.
This coffee is so hot I can't drink it.
Where did you get this?
Are we done?
You're from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're doing it well, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I get your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She's got red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way of recreation.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did you help?
You're a cop?
Tom didn't do anything we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom lied to us.
Tom heard Mary married.
I've learned a lot.
How much is this umbrella?
They're both laughing.
What happened?
This can be done.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class got flu.
Remember when you first heard Beatles?
Did Tom get hurt?
I want you to come to my party.
There's no toilet paper.
The word is silver, the silence is gold.
Please, sit here and wait.
I love that shirt.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom must still be angry.
I'm going to the airport.
Ignore her fancies.
I'm glad Tom's gonna help us.
Tom will be here in a minute.
I'm glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How much time does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see you again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I asked her out.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you come to China?
Do you approve of Tomâ€™s activities?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
That's a perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I'm over.
How is this my fault?
About Switzerland, did you go there in winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm learning Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off the loan debt.
Try to see it from Tom's point of view.
The window opened.
Nobody thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom looked pretty sick when I last saw him.
Tom's still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from ninth to fifth.
Let me do this with you.
Mary watched a romantic comedy.
Grab him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom's such an asshole.
You want some more potatoes?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a mustache.
I have three questions for you.
I've met Tom several times.
Do you use a word processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot of things together.
Please come back.
What are you doing tonight?
Why did you paint the bench red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, don't you?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not.
Let's go home.
I greeted Tom.
Tom took off his right ring.
I'm organizing your breakfast.
Tom was listening.
Who broke the window?
Your ideas are somewhat out of date.
