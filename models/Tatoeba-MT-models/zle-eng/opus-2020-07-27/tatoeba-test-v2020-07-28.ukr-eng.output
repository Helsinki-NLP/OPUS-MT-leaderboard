I'm happy with the result.
Computers are very useful.
It'll be pretty cold tonight.
I lost hope.
I forgot her name.
I'd like to know what you're looking for.
We may need to do so.
Here's an example.
She was sad.
I don't know how to thank you.
What a big cat!
She listens to religious music.
It's in any dictionary.
She sells vegetables.
I hope Tom and Mary are not lost.
Oxygen and hydrogen form water.
Tom rushed for Mary.
I'd like to be a famous football player.
We'll win.
Tom called.
I don't understand what's changed.
You and Tom, right?
I need to change my clothes.
Do you have headaches?

Let me check.
I've been going this way for four hours.

Is that what you want?
Don't talk so fast, please.
Tom cares about Mary.
I don't think I'll stay until the end of the concert.
I wish you a quick recovery.

Go ahead.

Men crawl at her feet.
Why did Tom decide to do so?
You're lucky?
No wonder she was alive.

So you can eat when he wants to.
Could you close the door?
I know what happened.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom said he'd do it again.
Are you alone now?
Just let 'em finish your routine.
Why did Tom run away?
Did he stop here before?
Tom fears Mary's dog.
You want a flat?
It was only one week before Halloween.
He's not always satisfied.
I tried to tell him about it, but he did not listen.
Let's sing something together.
I'm glad to help.
Eureka!
Did you ask others?
Tom met Mary at work.
Again, what's my password?
It's a good coat.
You're so disgusting.
Let Tom in.

It's a huge mistake.
Will you come back to me?
Tom's the only one who can't do it.
We cannot allow this to happen again.
Tom doesn't feel safe.
Tom says Mary won't bother anymore.

Maybe it's the same person.
Check words you cannot speak.

It's not him.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary came to Australia.
I bought a lot of books.
Please, sit here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Ask Tom if he can do it.
Sitting late every night will harm your health.
Did you know Tom left town?
They love us.
I don't need a computer.
Really?
Let's go now, or we'll be late.
That's your major problem.
No matter what, he still sucks at himself.
He fell under the table.
Tom doesn't want you to do this.
Did I change so much?
Have you ever lived abroad?
When did you come home?
It'll be hot tomorrow.
We need to talk.
The election was in November.
No one knows what's going to happen.
You need to be patient.
Are you paying in cash or a check?

You really think Tom's gonna win?
Italy is a beautiful country.
How long won't Tom be here?
It's a difficult question.
We both hate Tom.

Don't throw away the stones.
That's what I want you to smell.
Did you know who did this?
Why does this matter?
Why are you staying with Tom?
Many insects disappeared in one night.
Tom is infantic.
Where is the subway station?
No one knows how I feel.
I don't think Tom's gonna be here today.
We want to stay for three nights.

I'm in a point.
I really don't know how else I can explain it.
I'm not sure Tom knows what to do.
You're taller than me.
That's great!
Tom bought Mary a Christmas present.
I realized I wasn't ready.

Are you not a member of the committee?
I sat next to her.
I never heard Tom speak French.
I thought you said Tom was your brother.
Is he honest?
Tom doesn't tell me the truth.
Do you know that song?
I want to know exactly how Tom died.
Life is sometimes so unfair.
I don't intend to do this anymore.
Tom's got a lot of money in his suitcase.
You idiot!
Laly's sister loved herself.
I bought this book for ten dollars.
Tom is much older than he looks.
Don't be too stubborn.
I'll be back at six thirty.
Can I ask you some questions?
They all came back to see Tom.
Where's Dad?
Then he removed his glasses.
Short hair is very good for her.
Tom's cool.
Get a chicken before it is prepared.
I felt relief after I said everything I wanted to say.
I bought That's the sweater.
It's done like this.
I love cats.
Are you looking for something specific?
Whose fault is it?
No one stops you.
Tom wants to join the team.
You're too thin.
Come here.
There's a map on the wall.
You're very beautiful.
I came to see you.
What's your favorite pizza stuff?
The latter view has many adherents in Japan.
Don't you think you could do that?
I don't know what I can do for you.
Tom is smart.
He's annoying.
If you go, I'll miss you.
Put the smart man on the mistake, and he'll thank you, and point out the stupid one on the mistake, and he'll hurt you.
It's a great idea.
I don't think there's anything out there.
Make your point clear.
We don't know.
Tom must have forgotten to say that to Mary.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
I'll invite Tom to dinner.
Maybe I'll do it again.
You really think I'd do that?
That's a lie.
The war took away their happiness.
I wish I had enough money to buy a car.
Mary broke her laptop.
You don't have to play with the key.
Wouldn't Tom want to do it?
This bridge is by no means safe.
Can it wait?
I don't have as heavy a suitcase as Tom's.
You're a traitor.
I like to drink.
She sells an old-fashioned hat.
I like cats more than dogs.
Mary says she can't help us today.
You can go if you've decided.
He confessed his guilt.
Tom is convinced that Mary is guilty.
It's going to be Friday.
I'd eat bull.
I wonder if Tom can do that.
We're sure we'll deal with this.
His native country was Germany.
It's orange.
He's an atheist.
What is your aunt doing?
I was playing with a champion.
Tom warned you it might happen.
To be honest, I don't agree with you.
Mary said she believed it.
When are you leaving?
I've got a lot of friends.
I wish I could stay here forever.
After lunch, she always has time.
It covers less of the earth’s surface.
I have a twin.
We begged Tom not to go there.
I think we may have been too aggressive.
You're big.
I've got some free time.
I'll help you tomorrow.
This story made me nervous.
Watch your head!
I'll miss you.
Take this.
Tom asked you to do something?
Tom's dog is called Cookie.
I just changed the password.
I didn't do anything.
It took me about three hours to read the book.
The fucking fairy is a toothbrusher.
I thought you'd be happy.
Tom didn't want to wait.
I'm faithful.
I'm not very patient.
Jessie didn't speak French well, and German said it worse.
I just want to talk to them.
We didn't do anything wrong.
I'm often in trouble.
Tom still does what he has to do.
He married my brother.
It teaches us French.
He was absent from the meeting.
It's Tuesday.
Someone must have told Tom, but it wasn't me.
Don't worry, we're on our way.
Fire's gone fast.
He took a picture of the family.
We're often in Troms.
English Bush is perfect.
You know what kind of blood group Tom has?
I've never been to Europe.
Tom's trying to avoid a fight with Mary.
They'll understand.
There is only one store on the whole island.
I don't think Tom knows anybody who can do this.
Tom is deeply confused.
Anyone here?
Don't call me.
It's better to die standing than to live on your knees.
Tom's waiting.
Tom likes it all.
I knew you'd wait for us.
I can't forget her.
They have chosen a new government.
Please wait five minutes.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Bring me a clean plate and take away the dirty plate.
Tom told me he was alone.
Here's the church we got married to.
I don't think Tom would be absent.
I think that makes sense.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.
It was popular with the voters.
Tom didn't give up on me from French.
Elizabeth, Queen of England.
Where should I go?
Tom followed Mary’s example.
He gave me a pencil.

This patient can die at any time.
It was an accident.
It seems to me that if I were to speak more with the tongue, my English skills would improve quickly.
Bananas are yellow.
We need answers.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Perhaps Tom did not do what everyone said he did.
How's life-life?
Would it not be better if Tom did this to someone else?
When was the last time you were in Australia?
Vegans themselves.
This machine is morally outdated.
Everyone prayed.
How many examples do you need?
I'm the best.
Don't die.
I'll be there to help you.
Dance.
I have a great teacher.
He needs to be killed.
What will we eat tonight?
Have you found them yet?
You have to give her more time.
What are you doing with that?
She's so hard on him.
You're such a fool!
Dad bought me a book.
Tom is energetic.
So a lot didn't like it.
Tom knew Mary wouldn't be busy.
Dry sand takes water.
You always loved Tom, didn't you?
Here you go!
Tom says he can't win.
I won't do it.
Tom didn't look offended.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
You want me to bring you a glass of water?
Tom told me he thought Mary was ugly.
She smiled at me.
You know what their actresses are.
I don't think you're callous.
It's been built forever.
He passed the exam.
Whose friend are you?
Tom's too tired to work.
Tom threw Mary the ball.
Tom's pretty persuasive, isn't he?
I miss talking to them.
He tried not to cry.
They are compassionate.
Why didn't you ever say that to me?
Who told you I did it?
It's never too late.
Leave me alone.
Aren't you ready for more?
Tom has no idea why Mary lied.
Tom's looking for a job.
Father will be back in a few days.
Is it true that Midori plays the violin very well?
Well, that explains it.
You're a general optimist, aren't you?

All of these facts have been learned.
Tom's mad at you, isn't he?
I'd like to be a well-known football player.
Am I snoring?
Tell us something.
I'm glad you're doing this.
Since I didn't get the answer, I wrote it again.
What would you like to say?
You think it's a trap?
People, stop killing each other.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were planning on doing this.
I borrowed a car from Tom.
I don't think I could spend six hours with you alone.
The furniture is almost gone.
I'm ready to go, Tom isn't.
I feel different.
Whatever happens, I'll stay with you.

Tom didn't poison Mary.
She cried when she read the letter.
You have to tell the truth.
You may be right.
This one looks better.

We're here!
Does that bother you?
What's in the box?
Look out, it's still hot.
Tom treated Mary like a child.
Why are you so sad?
I did it just for fun.
Tom refused to say anything.

You mean you don't want to help us paint a ceiling?

You're too thin.
We talked for hours.
I'm very drunk.
Tom told me that he thought Mary could count on her.
Do you agree with their decision?
Put that on my account.
A hen would hang her eggs for one week.
You look good with your short hair.
Tom's in Boston.
Tom and I went to a concert.
Tom had a stroke.
Why did you ask Tom to do this because you knew he couldn't?
Did you see him leave?
Can I speak to Mrs. Brown?
He lived in the center of London.
What was inside?
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
What do you like better, summer or winter?
Don't you think you're gonna do that?
Fortunately, no one was squirting.
No one knows who killed Tom.
It's not as hard as you think.
Why are you mad at me?
Let's get drunk.
You need to wait.
Tom has a lot of friends.
What were you doing today?
I don't know what he knows.

Your words and God are in your ears!
Tom's coming next week.
You have to stop doing this right now.
My grandfather talks very slowly.
Did you win?
She can speak English quite well.
I have to go.
Tom didn't seem overly anxious.
Tom says he's planning to do it.
What he did was not wrong.
Can you give me a minute?
Is there anything cold to drink?
I need to talk to them.
They're too big.
We'll give you another chance.

We've seen it.
Tom never breaks his promises.
Smoke isn't good.
I think I'm gonna play tennis with Tom.

What is your father doing?
I'm a loser.
Do you know my wife?
Tom started to study French.

That must be a joke, huh?
Tom was in an accident at work.
You're not upset, are you?
We got half a dozen eggs.
Tom refused to go.
She drank coffee.

What do you think happened?
Mom put it on the table.
Please bring me a clean knife.
Mary is patient, isn't she?
You think Tom is part of the problem?
Tom didn't want to go for a walk.
Tom's waiting for me at the station.
I'm putting the cream in my coffee.
I can't stand this noise anymore.
Please don't go yet.
I was surprised at Tom’s sincerity.
I read the letters you sent me.
Have you seen the accident?
I know you were joking.
You want to learn how to play the guitar?
I didn't want to dance.
Wait, I'll pay for it.
We are confident of his success.

Would you like Tom to do this to you?
Did you know Tom was lonely?
Mary is my older sister.
He finally succeeded.

I don't like to borrow money from anyone.
We're teachers.
We're in the evacuation zone.

Nothing new.
I love her.
Would you like to join me for dinner?
I fully agree.
Is that what you mean?
Would you like a banana?
We have to be at work before 9:00.
We all slept.
I haven't washed my hands yet.
What is it?
Tom went to see Mary.
I have money.
I thought Tom understood.

Tom ran to catch up with Mary.
Can I help you?

I asked Tom what I should do.
I don't think Tom can ride a single-wheeled bicycle.
I'm too low.

It's confusing the context.

You can't smoke in this room.
It's gonna be tomorrow.
I hate that picture.

What did you say to Tom?
She lives close to us.
Don't drink too much coffee.
Can you answer that?
What happened on October 20th?
I'm guessing Tom's not involved.
If you have any questions, let me know.
I'll handle Tom.
I want to kiss you.
He's been very busy all day.
Tom will come back, I'm sure he'll come back.
He managed to escape.
I wonder what Tom is thinking.

Tom's too late.
Tom's good at speaking French.
Tom said he couldn't find anything to eat.
Today is a pleasant day.
It's changing fast.
I'm completely confused.

Anyway, I just can't accept it.
Did you find any problems?
Who's going?

We learned that Tom was in an accident.
I hope you come back.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
You told me to do it.

Can I do that again?
Are your kids still sleeping?
You have to try again.

I want to see what happens.
Tom sat in front of Mary.
I have less money than you do.

We drank a lot.
Who else did you tell?

Is that your beer?
Security not guaranteed.

I wonder if she will recognize me after so many years.
Sometimes I'm very careless.
I know you don't trust us.
I didn't kill anyone.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in Australia next week.
Tom should have waited.
You ate.
I haven't seen him for about three years.
I'm afraid I won't finish the report on time.
It's unlikely I'll be there tonight.
I don't trust you.
She's traveling around the world.
The boys are fine.
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do it.

I just did my job.
Tom didn't call.
No one knows what's going to happen.
We're always waiting for something.
Thank you very much.
I wasn't sorry.
Many young people this summer went to Hawaii.
Tom is my twin brother.
At this point, there are no comments.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
Don't resist.
You'll pay for it!
Do you understand?

He speaks German.
Tom's not as busy as you are.
Why are you wearing so many shoes?
You're very brave.
I'm completely naked.
No one heard of my country.
He became a national hero.
Tom said where did he do it?
We're studying Chinese.
How can I get to the other side?
Do we have a choice?
No way.
Let me see.
Tom began to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He's running to the station every morning.
They're running out of provisions.
Not here.
No one was satisfied.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I tried to sleep.
Tom's always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just texted me.
So somewhere in this building.
We're open tomorrow.
I didn't expect such a turn of events.
I think I'll start off with a bottle of beer.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There must be some logic.
Did you work last night?
How did you convince Tom to help us paint the cherries?
Were you in the U.S. capital, Washington?
Mary kept her balance.
I'm just lucky.
They're very subjective.
It's a printout.
I wonder if Tom is angry or not.

Are you vegetarian?
Do you want to live forever?
Listen to me, but what am I supposed to say?
He'll be here soon.
Can't you pick me up?
I'm not pregnant.
He didn't crash.
I have a question.
What a missing thing!
Tom said Mary was probably still doing it.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The chief allowed me to leave earlier today.
At what time is the end of the world?
I'm never worried.
That's nice!
When I'm in bad humor, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
It'll be pretty cold tonight.
I'm not asking Tom for help.
How much did you pay to do that.
You don't have to stay.
One day we'll see each other again.
You said you wouldn't do it.
It was a long flight.
Don't tell anyone.
It's time for me to go.
I was broken up.

Finally, he resolved to offer her a suggestion.
Tom was not surprised to find that Mary spoke French so well.
I know you're here.
It's about three o'clock in the morning.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
There is no hope.
It's not mine.
What exactly do you want, Tom?
We're almost done.
So you have to be at home by 2:30 a.m.
Are you walking to school?
Is that Tom's girl?
Tom's wasting his time.
The molecule is made up of atoms.
We're aware of that.
Now's not a good time.
Will you have time to join me for lunch?
I wish he hadn't come to a meeting.
Where do you live now?
You know, he's been through a difficult period recently.
Tom married a neighbor.
My head hurts.
Say it again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.
I am learning English.
Nice weather, isn't it?
Come if you can.
I hate it!
You're a little young to me.
Tom's too old for you.
Tom said he expected Mary to do so.
Tom didn't look back.
My parents just arrived at the station.
I waved my hand.
Did you buy a Christmas present for Tom this year?

What did you learn today?

I'll be back in less than five minutes.
You don't aim hard enough.
I'd like to order a sandwich.

Who else helped you?
I'd love to help you.
Are you over 18?
The dog's trying to escape.
Tom can't read.
I just bought a boat.
Tom had no idea Mary was on him.
Tom is disgusting.
The apotheca is on Fresno Street.
Tom's your uncle, isn't he?
Are you ready to hear the bad news?
I talked to them.
Has Lucy phoned yet?
Looks like Tom.
You don't have to do it if you don't want to.
I was just about to wash myself.
That's nice!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do this?
Mary wants me on her team.
No one else listens.
You're brave.
You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit there.
Put it down.
Tom came last.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Mary ate alone.
You're really gonna find them, aren't you?
I don't have enough moisture.
Are you sure Tom's coming?
Where'd you get this key?
Can I help you with something, ma'am?
I don't think it's gonna hurt me.
Tom's going for you.

Tom's dog followed him to school.
Who taught Tom how to do this?
Tom doesn't often do that.
Can I use your phone?

Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do this.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees it.
I was on the wrong bus.
I turned down the offer.
Mary had already done what she had to do.
I've been watching Tom.
Did you reserve the table?
Where'd the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like it.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Don't you recognize this man?
Like going to the picnic.
We couldn't buy tickets to concert until we got money from our friends.

She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a bazburger, a circle, and free potatoes.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly accepted.
I think Tom is wrong.
You all right?
You may be the only one who can do this.
Who doesn't have a radio?
Your singing makes professional singers redhead with shame.
You know Tom is lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, Tom.
He was great.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary who did it.

You're lucky to have such a good job.
What do you keep in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It is unlikely that Tom will forget how this is done.
Drink?
Tom will do this with you?
You're not asleep?
The meeting began at 5 p.m.
Mary said she liked it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary was not busy.
I was only in Tokyo once.
I got an electric bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom and I'll be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do this.
All members are required to attend.
Don't you feel comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning to do this?
We are content with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.
He stood in the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always say that to me.
Is that Mary's husband?
He'll find out.

They didn't give up hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom washed his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We have to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you where the party is going?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled that vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll bite it.
I don't want it anymore.
Do you know how she likes colors?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here today.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, I'd love to!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
Spring soon.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to think of a secret language.
Are you planning on staying for a while?
When are you planning on going to Japan?
My kids are at school.
I put my suitcase.
I'm out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?

I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
The next month Tom's coming from Boston.
It's still hot.

Every year, millions of people starve to death.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
The letter was the wrong address.
This is the last train.
Who's going to fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
Everything's in chocolate.
They switched to another religion.
I need to be more careful.
I did it.
Mary sold the car.

You're the best!
You ever gonna do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I'm just jumping.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
We owe it ourselves.
You're so cute.
It's going to cost about fifteen dollars.
I slamming the door.
His theory is noteworthy.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.

I like that dog.
I tried to contact her.
What's she got?
How's the exam?
Where was the book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary do it.
We have to help Tom.
The rain went on all day.
I'm upset about this.
Can I have your phone number?
You need to stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do that?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is 10 minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines during the day, and the moon at night.
I got on it.
You were right before.
I hope Tom can help us.

Listen to his frank opinion.
Aren't you on a schedule tonight?
Tom never had much to learn.
How's your wife doing, Tom?

I shouldn't have come here.
Tom's fine, isn't he?
I wish you hadn't been such a fucking asshole.
Did Tom give you anything for me?
I could never do that without your help.
I always have coffee and gravel for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I didn't have breakfast.

Thomas was practicing.
It's excruciating.
He's sure he'll pass the exam.
Tom voted for the offer.
Tom told you how much time it took to do that?
Let's get started!
Attention!
I'm completely exhausted.
Prospects aren't too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm attracted to the Devil's literary pride.
The trouble is she lacks experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their child John.
I wonder if Tom will actually go to Mary's concert.
Did Tom say he'd spent the last weekend with that?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's just not do anything.
Tom wants his father to be buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution.
Tom promised me we wouldn't cry.
I'm a D.J.
I hate Christmas.
Was there enough money?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It costs too much.
I lost a child.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to hold back.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows a lot.
You're not young.
The same is true for Japan.
We'll lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Speak.
The surface of the balloon is a non-euclidic, so it does not follow the rules of euclidian geometry.
The negotiations were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I never killed anyone.
Be honest and forthright.
Hope is always there.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice as old as me.
The journalist was abducted by terrorists.
I let the ball down.
I hate this town.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
The programming language is his hobby.
I'm glad to hear it.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many watches do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
So you don't like eating fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is very proud of you.
Your doctor says you're gonna be fine.
You're a panda.
Do you want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need that money.
My tie's orange.
Is Tom still crying?
So I'd like to be taller.
I have to help my mom.
His book inspired me.
Are you brothers?
These aren't my ideas.
You have a plan, don't you?
He's out.
Tom's not in town.
I had shoes.
The next year's going to be worse.
Mary's in yellow dress.
Love has bitter taste.
The meeting was over.
You should have done that last year.
I thought I couldn't do it.
I've got an old car.
We understand why.
I'm driving every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
We're off the elevator.
Tom's a professional hockeyist.
We went to the forest looking for insects.

You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She took a walk at school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom doesn't think I should do that.
State debt goes up.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom's probably never gonna do that.
That's the doll.
Get out of here!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Is Tom still wearing a bicycle?
I'll be brief.
Tom's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anybody who could do it.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in Osaka in 1997.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do that.
I hope Tom understands.
It spends too much time on the Internet.
You're beautiful.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't overdo it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's going in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car.
We can talk.
The computer can count fast.
You don't need it.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I am thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Do you want some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for dinner today?
You can't even swap it.
People still using webcams?
I wonder if Tom used to ask Mary why she left school.
This word is taken from the Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
He's sick.
Don't push.
The car's outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.

There are no rules.

He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make a salad from a raw fish?

We actually went to Boston.
In Iceland there are many volcanoes.
John is two years older than I am.
For better or worse, TV has changed the world.
I'm a little thick.
He could easily answer my question.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He must be innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When does she arrive?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm very glad I did it yesterday.
Tom still with you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you see him often?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You'll stop.
She had been waiting for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was a two-year-old.
Tom must do this.
It has to be the right color.
Tom has a very strict mother.
After a brief peace, war broke out again.

What's the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you give me some sugar?
Where is Tom going to build his house?
Where's my laptop?
I don't think there'll be any problems.
Was Tom broken?
You need to climb up.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary plays soccer.
How does it work?
You're very ugly.
Hurry up, boys.
I'll fix my shirt.
When Is His Return Expected?
I had a good break.
He is no less good than his sister.

I make too many mistakes.
He's not afraid of death.
It would be nice if there were 28 hours in the day, wouldn't it?
Kobe is the city I was born into.
He would like to see this disaster not happening.
We do not expect to win.
I don't have any money.
I don't teach here anymore.
We haven't found a boy.
Go on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
Tom will soon learn to swim.
What's wrong with the way I did it?
They know how to fish.
Tom's out of the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom teaches French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could do it.
I don't have books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for her gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My work is very boring.
He's a robot man, as it were.
Answer the question!
You need a hospital.
I can't find any support.
It's a fake.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do it.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often mistaken.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, and the Grand Pri was broadcast there.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
English isn't my own language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the name of this girl?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So you don’t have to do this again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom was staring at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of her children while she is away.
I'm cooking right now.
Did you see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He's often late.

Not all the glistening gold.
I don't have much friends.
Do you believe there's a god?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
I didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don't you start bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I won't work for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I am a student, and he is not.
I tried to do that.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new sledge.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister, Sakiko, born the same year as I, and she's getting ready for exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Did you complete your homework?
Monday will probably be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help him paint the fence.
Why do people act like big apes and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Asshole.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should see a doctor.
I gave the papers to the visa.
It's snowing today.
She kept working.
We went to the mountain where we were going.
Tom's driving.
If you ate less hamburgers, you might be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good Choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom should be taken to the hospital.
I had to go on my own.
Please show me how it's done.
Aren't you dating anyone?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What date is today?
Where's Daddy?
Shut the door.
I'm not talking to Tom French.
Apple from the apple tree doesn't fall much.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Your uncle is your father’s brother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She's got red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was at the jeans.
I'll see you after the play.
I'd like to ask the question.
This is my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Do you mind?
I haven't seen you forever.
You must be right.
Whose books are they?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks his dogs twice a day.
Let me look at Tom's book.
Japan’s main islands are Hokkaido, Sykok, Honshu, and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should leave now.
We didn't.
Do you think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I won't help you.
Break it up.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare with him in a tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We set up our office with computers.
We have to pay early.
Are you sure?
Do you think Tom will die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do anything you accused me of.
Please, don't be late.
I know Tom is drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book became the subject of criticism.
It'll be brilliant.
I'm really scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm under the fly.
You haven't lost your time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom witnessed in Mary’s case.
I thought you were leaving.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can I ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You need to quit smoking.
I think Tom's betraying me.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Can you play violin?
Give me some salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom is good at speaking French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
It was popular for both the students and the teachers.
Tears of grief will not help.
Tom is playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom didn't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not young people like Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up the phone.
I'll be right back.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do this.
Tom is calling.
You have to tell him to do it.
He's talking at the esperanto with a little French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't do it.
She's got good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom have done that?
I hope Tom's coming to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a ladies' steward.
I'll handle it.
Have you found any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a wizard?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Fuck off.
Will you let Tom lock you?
You're a beautiful woman.
There's hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Tom actually moved to Boston?
Tom pulled out Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He came back to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Don't you still have cold?
Language speakers instinctively follow the rules of their language without even being aware of them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters pointed their rifles at the elephant.
No one cares.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom's wife is a Canadian.
Do you have an allergy?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do it.
I'd like to take the money off.
I'll shake Tom's hand.
They're gonna be okay.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You don't have to worry about the exam tomorrow.
Was Tom voting?
I'll be back.
Tom wouldn't force Mary to do that.
Tom started to pull.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You can't escape.
I am Japanese, but I don’t live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where have you been on vacation?
Did you get Tom's Christmas present this year?
I still miss my home a little bit, and so many things seem strange to me.
I have memory problems sometimes.
Where's Mom?
He fainted three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
We shouldn't talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Tom's okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know the reason?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little off the schedule.
Tom is not a hero.
Is it possible to catch taxis here?
Hurry or you'll be late.
It'll be complicated.
Is Tom always acting that way?
I like golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You're never lying.
Wait a minute, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It'll work, so you'll see.
She threw it away.
Tom's safe.
I eventually got the driver's license.
I'm not a student.
That's why Mary was sorry.
I'm just looking at the news right now.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's the wife?
You're right.
Tom is not rich, and Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone's late except for me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan on squeezing the boat.
The money doesn't smell.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed with your effectiveness.
Didn't you have a car before?
You were at work?
What do you teach?
I'm sorry to eat those oysters.
Hello.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
It completely ignores me.
Tom goes to the party tonight.
I told you.
She was headed for the airport.
She studies Portuguese in Brazil.
What do you tell them?
How did you know that would happen?
What is it?
If natural speech is comparable to a time - growing tree, the esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was artificially created.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's going to Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom's got a nice garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said what happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you tell him I was joking?
That's why it was terribly boring.
Tom said I was beautiful.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's excruciating.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
What do you understand?
Are they suspicious of me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take the garbage.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston map?
Your sister's always great.
It will be very difficult to do that.
The child was paralyzed from fear.
Do you like those perfumes?
How awful!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him, you should consider his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
That's his mandatory idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly left the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe it.
I was wearing a white dress.
Check again.
Tom's got a son-in-law.
I know it'll be impossible.
Do you have anything to do with headaches?
Children imitate their friends, not their parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with friends outside.
Whatever happens, stay calm.
Tom sent a message to Mary.
He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus had already gone.
Tom's in a black coat today.
I'll wait until 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're useless.
Did you try to talk to them?
It was much harder to do than I thought it was.
Her friends made fun of her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom could win.
The aliens are coming and taking away our work.
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
Are you going on a train?
Tom said Mary was beautiful.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, aren't they?
So does Boston still like it?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a medical doctor.
He's gone abroad and never came back.
Gather your toys together.
It was much harder to do than I thought it was.
I think I did well.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
So it's interesting.
Are you done yet?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not hard to do that.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you to help me?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I've never lived in Boston.
That's important to me.
That box was too heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't.
You missed something.
I immediately called Tom.
You looked interested.
That'll help.
I'm sleeping.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
Ken has two cats.
I realized what my mistake was.
I love trips.
The phone doesn't work.
That's what we want.
Tom's in sunglasses.
Tom is good at painting.
All you have to do is click on the red button.
You looked sad.
Where can I rent a suit for Halloween?
Tom is busy and he can't help you right now.
We're not a couple.
You want to see a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I've got a fever.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Did Tom really think that someone was listening?
You don't need any luck!
Tom, you might say it's nice.
Anyway, I won't agree with you.
I should have left earlier.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is, solar energy is way too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a hangover.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
You understand?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
What do you say thanks to Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tom's wife asked him to quit his job.
Could you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could have and had to help Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a ticket for free.
You're such a miserable person.
What's going on here?
Tom said you were speaking French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's free.
I am very interested in French.
Be good to the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight that I could lend you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't believe anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your job.
You work around here?
You admit it, don't you?
I got business tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but I grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to understanding.
I'm sharing.
The choices are obvious.
The only person Tom is talking about at all is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I don't sleep well.
Don't you buy that?
Women are good.
Wouldn't it be nice if Tom did it?
You did it?
I'm having trouble sleeping at night.
Tom sometimes gets annoyed at me.
I'm a pretty good dancer.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obvious that you're going to have to spend less time sleeping in us.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
I never said no.
Rio's got a subway.
Are you ready to help us?
Tom is a rare bastard.
His hair was getting thinner and thinner.
My sister left for Kobe yesterday.
Aren't you speaking from a point of view?

It's Communism.
The river will suddenly narrow down here.
Jesus is a parasite.
I don't often do it.
Tom is a very practical person.
I have a good motherfucking.
I need political asylum.
It was quiet after the storm.
There is no easy way to succeed.
There's the train.
He loves tigers.
It's raining, so we can't do it.
It was extremely surreal.
These students are Koreans.
Get out of here!
What's your name?
Tom and Mary plan to retire when they're sixty-five years old.
Can I use your phone?
Your suffering makes me happy.
When did you do anything for me?
We locked the door.
There he is!
We're different.
Do Tom and Mary know?
You all right?
Don't sleep with the light on.
He's not stupider than you.
Trains in Serbia are terribly slow.
It seems to me that Tom is vicious.
"Coni" is the set word for "Kinn."
Where's the ashtray?
Can you tell me what you're talking about?
I'm sorry I didn't tell him the truth.
He didn't dare say no to my plan.
Tom told a troubled neighbor to get on with his life and stop sucking his nose in the interests of others.

It's very cold.
That's why you came back from Boston, isn't it?
Did Tom believe that?
In fact, he's never been to New York.
Tom thought that Mary and John might be involved in arms smuggling.
I was sober then.
Here's your roll.
Tom was waiting for Mary.
Rio de Janeiro was founded in 1565.
I'm going to Boston with Tom.
I don't think you can do that.
First of all, you have to understand yourself.
I was there yesterday.
I'll wait here until he comes.
Tom can drive.
I read novels at random.
I was gonna tell Tom, but I forgot.
I'm a hero.
They love us.
I really need your help.
Tom betrayed you.
I got up about six.
I don't want to boast, but I'm smart enough.
Does it matter?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Tom may not even get to the team.
I ask myself if you can trust it.
What did you find?
Are you drinking?
I was angry.
When did he arrive?
Where's your ivy bear?
How you doing, Tom?
Maybe this year we're finally going to win the Europeans.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I managed to forget my wallet.
Cats catch mice.
You can go.
Tom said he wouldn't mind doing it for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I forced Tom to do it.
Why would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the earth’s magnetic field with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
That's Tom's signature.
What's really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in, I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this somehow?
Do I make myself clear?
I'm free this afternoon.
Tom must be punished for doing so.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
There's no need to rush.
Are you happy?
I didn't believe him at first.
The phone's not working at this time.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Come inside.
Tom might be fined if he did.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really silly.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom said he saw John in January.
You're always getting up early, aren't you?
She always contradicts herself.
They live in the same state.
My dog's going after me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Tom's already in French.
The earth went from father to son.
There's no roses without spikes.
I hope they're not.
Don't drink too much, huh?
Wait for a surprise tonight.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He gave up his family.
Let's go?
You don't have to contact Tom.
I shaved.
I'm the boss.
Tom's good.
You have to go home by 9:00.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted he did.
Tom can't drive a car.
Tom spent that day with his daughter.
Every student has his own party.
We were ready.
I'm worried about what might be sued me.
My family lives here.
Tom is listening.
It's out of my hand.
Tom's good at speaking French.
I know I'm going to learn a lot.
I went to fishing on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
The party's over.
The uncycle has one wheel.
"Daddy, look over there, shark!" "It's a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very friendly.
I'm a botan.
I think Tom knows something.
That was my mistake, not Tom.
The meetings were pretty good.
At this time of the year, the wind is blowing from the ocean.
I saw Tom smiling.
Come on, now!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned that.
Go and beat that hooligan.
That's our car.
Hi, I'm Bashir!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I am ashamed that I did.
Do I have to go to the hospital?
In her spare time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom is singing the cants better than any other one of my friends.
He drinks a moderate quantity of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how she's dressed.
Did you see his new movie?
I'm good at this.
Why did he quit?
Tom said Mary was gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My open mind is that it's a horrible movie.
You're very elegant.
Whatever you want.
I could change.
It's substantial.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
Tom's got her.
Tom was a barefoot.
I did everything I could.
If you see a mistake, please correct it.
We tried again, but we didn't.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure if I'm willing to do it.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You have to help her.
You won't pay for any trouble.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to climb that mountain.
Tom missed lunch.
You speak good English.
He loved his parents.
Come on, I'll talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love cannot be bought.
If you didn't want to come, I had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What theater is this?
Did you see the squirrel?
Mary said Tom told her.
Tom wasn't a very good witness.
I visited my grandmother.
I hate the wedding.
I heard the front door slam.
I can't keep track of you.
Mary dances great.
My grandfather's from Oscar.
I need to relax.
Tom's so lucky.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did this.
What do you think, Tom will be here?
Tonight will be snow?
Do you like that?
Are you here seeing anyone?
I live in Milan.
When did she do anything for me?
I ate the orange.
The square root of two is an irrational number.
It's small.
Didn't you know it would happen?
Bad thoughts give birth to bad acts.
Did you bring the fen?
Tom's not wrong.
Do you have a drop from that bill?
Tom seems a bit ashamed.
We can't do without water.
I can't get my mind together.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in the village.
I would never give up.
I speak French freely.
Tom didn't waste his time.
Give me a hint.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He got very drunk.
Tom says he's satisfied.
How are you feeling now?
How many guys in your class?
It's big apples.
Choose a gift carefully.
I'm coming with her.
Why would you do something similar?
The richest man in the world could not buy his love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
Lack of news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers save us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You were in London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I'm walking slowly.
After the film, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We'll be married in June.
I wonder if Tom has left Boston.
I threw my bones.
The book lacked a few pages.
I picked up a coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks his promises.
We have to protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sara don't get along very well.
Every student has his own party.
I spent twelve hours in train.
I'll regret it.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom has no thirst.
I learned to eat the cow.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry I'm not rich.
The news really upset her.
I've got a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see it yourself.
I never killed anyone.
What's your name supposed to be?
She's holding flowers in her hand.
Have you spoken to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man's already over ninety.
This coffee is so hot I can't drink it.
Where did you get this?
Are we done?
You're from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're doing it well, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I get your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She's got red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way of recreation.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did you help?
You're a cop?
Tom didn't do anything we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom lied to us.
Tom heard Mary married.
I've learned a lot.
How much is this umbrella?
They're both laughing.
What happened?
This can be done.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class got flu.
Remember when you first heard Beatles?
Did Tom get hurt?
I want you to come to my party.
There's no toilet paper.
The word is silver, the silence is gold.
Please, sit here and wait.
I love that shirt.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom must still be angry.
I'm going to the airport.
Ignore her fancies.
I'm glad Tom's gonna help us.
Tom will be here in a minute.
I'm glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How much time does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see you again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I asked her out.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you come to China?
Do you approve of Tom’s activities?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
That's a perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I'm over.
How is this my fault?
About Switzerland, did you go there in winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm learning Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off the loan debt.
Try to see it from Tom's point of view.
The window opened.
Nobody thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom looked pretty sick when I last saw him.
Tom's still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from ninth to fifth.
Let me do this with you.
Mary watched a romantic comedy.
Grab him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom's such an asshole.
You want some more potatoes?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a mustache.
I have three questions for you.
I've met Tom several times.
Do you use a word processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot of things together.
Please come back.
What are you doing tonight?
Why did you paint the bench red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, don't you?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not.
Let's go home.
I greeted Tom.
Tom took off his right ring.
I'm organizing your breakfast.
Tom was listening.
Who broke the window?
Your ideas are somewhat out of date.
