A 28-year-old cook was found dead at the San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old cook who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the flight of a local shopping mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who wants to hurt him, but he says, "The end of the case was on his way."
A body found in Westfield Moll on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galcia, and reported to the San Francisco Forensic Bureau of Medicine.

"We're a little team that works like a friendly family and will miss him very much," said the representative.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Luis Galcia said Frank stopped at the hostels first, but recently, "He's had his business all over again."
"He found an apartment, he met a girl," Luis Galcia said to the King.
Luis Galcia said he couldn't imagine someone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of communication with his family has always been for us to cook a dish, cook a meal for us,” Luis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of fight.
He was a brother who was swimming.
"With all the bad things that's going on with this world, he was the rough diamond that lit up brightly every day," he said.

Scientists have found animals that can live for 500 years
The international team of biologists concluded that the longest-lived spinal animal is the Greenlandic polar shark, which can live for some 500 years, transmitted to RT.
Scientists carried out radio-carbon analysis of the brittle eyes of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five metres long, may be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolicism has played an important role in the long-run. It has led to slow development.
Males of Greenland sharks are only about 150 years old when they reach puberty.
Previously, it was thought that the longer all the vertebrae animals live, the shark's neighbour, the Greenland whale.
The oldest person known to be a scientist was just over 210 years old.

Should we go to a sanatorium if there is no health problem?
Our expert is the chief doctor of Olga Bohsch's sanatorium.
And if a person is healthy, is he just tired of his job, or should he go to a sanatorium?
Rest and recreation are essential not only for the treatment but also for the prevention of disease.
Under sanatorium conditions, a person can check the condition of his or her body and receive medical advice on how to live so that his or her health will not be destroyed.
Such advice will not be beyond anyone.
"Just tired from work" is an important signal from the body, and it's not worth snooping.
Continued stress, mental and physical weariness can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is about 90% of those coming.
The most vulnerable people from the big cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's better not to complicate the situation and let yourself rest on time.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people lower their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the entire family.
So if you want to spend time with your kids, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the most young, there are health-care programmes that include both diagnostic services, paediatric counselling, testing and treatment.
For example, navigation (many sanatoriums are children ' s basins), inhalation, special feeding, massages, oxygen cocktails, and physical therapy.
The course of procedures determines the doctor according to the individual testimony and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, the sanatoriums tend to operate a children ' s club with animators, where children can attend games, various workshops.
Some sanatoriums even open their doors to visitors with infants, provide breastfeeding facilities, and offer services to an experienced baby baby babysitter.
The soft winter, prolonged summer, the pouring of sun days per year (over 300) creates good conditions for year’s rest in the Caucasus Mineral Water resorts.
And then the body needs rest, not just in summer.
So it is not worth the fear of the weather behind the window, especially since most procedures are indoors and do not depend on the season.
Generally, it is desirable that treatment be administered twice a year, especially for adults.
Of course, the main area of the Caucasus Mineral Waters region has been the treatment of mineral sources: Slavanovsky, Smyrnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water properties are unique and affect the various systems of the organism.
The water varies by temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical composition and gas composition.
The doctor takes water according to the patient's feelings.
Thus, Noarzan has a fire-extinguishing, immunosing effect, restoring the function of the gastrointestinal tract and the exchange of substances.
Esentuki-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract, lowers the sugar level.
Esentuki is new with anti-inflammatory, yellowish and urination effects.
The waters of Slavanova also have the same effects.
A doctor must take account of the state of the cardiovascular system when it comes to water.
If there's signs of hypertension, he's picking up less salty water because salts are held in, which causes pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires a regime: water should be treated at a certain time, in quantity and temperature required.
Various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are now available in the sanatoriums.
What kinds of healings based on the nature of the North Caucasus can be obtained from resorts in the region?
Near Pygorsk, for example, is the salty Lake Tambukan, which uses tin mud for joints, spines, internal organs.
It has a anti-inflammatory, dispersal, immunosing effect.
It's a healthy walk along individually designed routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort (second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is close to the mineral source Narzan.
There are also baths of wine, pearls, yolk, rural, raffle lacre, whichever is assigned to you as a doctor.
An extra fertility.
What can you do to make your harvest through the end of the season?
Tells Julia Bellopoohov, agroman and a girl.
It is time for the tall-grassed tomato to cut off new pastures, cut the chips, remove all the leaves before the last tow with the fruit and the small entrape, and fail to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the “constitution” and peppers and cormorants, with percussion-supposphosphate, bioprescription (Draft - to accelerate oil and fruit growth, Phytosporin-M, Fitolarvin, Gammair, Battophyte - disease, immunocyticitis - to increase immunity, Bactocsibilylin, Lepidid, Fitoverm - if there are pests).
Only copper domes, collodium sulphur and green soap should be used from chemicals at the end of the summer.
We're making the last crop of plants.
Long filmed cucumbers in the heat shall be removed from the wallpaper in such a way that the lower, nude portion of the stem (25-40 cm) will lie on the ground, with warm water and with the circonus solution, with a stalk drying of 5-7 cm compost.
It is also not easy to extend the fruit of the pot, by removing the old leaves, by pouring warm water, and by breaking up the integrated fertiliser, and by drying the fertile ground under the bush.
To protect against night colds, place an arc with covered material above the set.
Keep the plant open by day, and close by sunset.
The sign of the end.
What indicates that Russia comes out of a crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s withdrawal from Russia’s longest 20 years of recession.
The GDP of the Russian Federation has shown positive momentum in the second quarter of GDP has declined by 0.8 per cent in annual terms, as noted by Bloomberg analysts.
The figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to Russia's latest data, the recession in the second quarter slowed down to 0.6%.
The stabilization of the situation has also recently been announced by Central Bank and the Ministry of Development.
Forward is slow growth.
According to the CBI experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
“The index estimate of Russian GDP shows that recession is behind and forwards a slow growth in the economy,” says a report by the Bank of Russia, “What trends say.”
The cumulative assessment of GDP for the current quarter by regulators increased to 0.4 per cent, with an estimate of 0.5 per cent for the fourth quarter.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter of the GDP decline, the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter of the year at 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared decline in GDP was 0.2 per cent of GDP to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the recession stopped: in April, it was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June, GDP changes were within 0-0.15', quoting a representative of RIA News.
The slowing down of the Russian economy over the past five blocks shows that “just past”.
Among other markers indicating signs of recovery in the national economy, Bloomberg calls increasing demand for electricity and rail transport, a revival of the business.
If an amendment is made to the high year, it is clear that the trend of plus 1 per cent of electricity consumption may be due to additional work hours.
Add a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is an increase in freight traffic, but it's hard to get accurate data, and plus - minus 0.5% of half an hour's volume can also be explained by seasonality,” explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BRRO BRRO.
On the other hand, there are other, more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressures.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared to 15.6 per cent last month.
Moreover, the last two weeks, Rosstat, have recorded deflation.
Prices fell in Russia for the first time in five years.
If we look at the momentum of the rouble, which, although showing strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since the beginning of the year since August.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by real economy indicators,” adds Yakovenko.
In addition, industrial output has increased since April.
In June, the rate increased by 1.7 per cent.
The rate of decline of foreign trade has slowed from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
A positive development is also evident in the labour market, where unemployment has dropped to 5.4 per cent.
It was only below in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the labour market situation, the real income of the population left a question for the better.
In annual terms, the rate drops by 4.8 per cent.
This may slow the recovery of the economy, as household expenditure contributes a lot to GDP.
As a general rule, their share exceeds 50% in the structure of the economy.
In addition to the low consumption rate, the Bank of Russia ' s hard policy is also a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator retains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which does not have a better impact on the real sector.
Inadequate investment was also a negative factor, hampering industrial capacity development.
In general, however, it may be assumed that by the end of the year, the decline in the economy of the Russian Federation will be slowed to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015” as an analyst for the UK Forx Club Irina Rogowa.
The process of naturalization of athletes recently launched in Russian football and well-established in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi until they are so actively developed in summer sports.
If the Olympic Games in Rio are for Russia and represent former foreigners, most of the time they are members of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can see the reverse process – a sufficient number of Russians are under the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of changing nationality varies.
Some parents had been taken to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone couldn't stand the competition for a place in the Russian assembly.
And somebody believed that the best conditions for sports development would be created abroad.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
A German passport of a 27-year-old girl says that she's called Lisa Red.
But she used to be, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the town of Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow the footsteps of her older sister, to take up a light athlete.
Like the sister, Lisa chose six-story jumps.
Staying in Russia, I don't think I'd be able to "turn off the throne" Ellen Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, on the Olympics in Rio Lisa, there will be the only land left in the sixth race, if not the former.
Its best achievements in this form of sport are the bronze championship of Europe in 2010 and the silver of its continental firstry in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Pierjekov was born in Novokuztsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelists.
A little bit because of their faith, they left for the U.S. when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started fighting in school.
She showed good results in her move to Colorado Springs, where the U.S.
In 2012 in London, Elena lost her first fight.
But at the championship of peace that year, it was a victory.
Before that, it had, by the way, won the world ' s silver race in 2010.
This was followed by bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the town of Jaroslavla, where she first met a simultaneous swim.
But saying that she was raised by our trainers in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her classes.
Soon she was in the United States and she was showing great results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America its indicators are ceilings.
The new name, which appears strange to me, Cristina Schaldibina was 11 years old when her parents decided to continue her education in artistic gymnastics beyond the ocean.
Up until now, she was engaged in a favorite sport in Jaroslavla's hometown.
When she emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth assembly of that country and later entered the main national team.
At the Pan American Games 19-year-old Christian won gold and silver.
It did not have to be fought in the first place on the world stage, but for the United States, it organized a real breakthrough -- it brought out a star-solved set on the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our ex-boyfriends is Jan Beeseco-Marggander, who is in favour of Germany's collection.
She was born in Tolita.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had a better chance of entering the national assembly.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is true that she was able to take up only 17 places that are not sufficient for her to enter the final personal competition.
Just two years before that, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games, boys.
Another gymnast, this time only sportsman, Irina Sazonov.
If the ways of emigrating the previously mentioned athletes are standard, the choice of the Irina family is not clear: Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland she became the champion of the country.
True, Ira is being trained yet, especially in Russia, when he comes to his home country so as not to lose his skills.
In Rio, she did not speak as well as she wished.
The best place is 40 in the private round.
There's very little evidence of the plump Maria Uglykow in the Russian information space.
Mary has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
For a long time, however, she had been under the Russian flag, showing a good result, even a record 200 metres of the country's distance.
In 2015, it acquired Swiss citizenship and began speaking under a red and white flag.
In Rio her best speech is 14 places in a comprehensive estaphet 4x100.
To get on the game, the girl started a crowding project that helped to bring together some 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for preparations for the Olympics.
Adam Butrov, a 31-year-old freestyle fighter, spent almost all his career under Russian flag.
During this time, Hasavurt, a native, succeeded in becoming the three-fold prize of European champions, the champion of Russia, the international class of sport in Russia.
When he stopped getting into our national assembly, it was time to think about the change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter has disappeared from a sporting position.
The Triumph return was held at the Asian Cup in 2016 - Batov was already representative of Bahrain, for which Bahrain won the gold medal and was given a ride to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-Russian, Michael Kownov, is less known in the country than even Swiss ploughing Maria Ugkovu.
The point is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to do sports gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio its best outcome was 40 seats in parallel beams.
But for New Zealand, even the Olympic Games in sports gymnastics are a breakthrough.
When Nastze, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her training in the simultaneous navigation of high performance at the national level.
In 2014, at the European championship in Berlin, the girl took the sixth seat in the simultaneous swimming.
In a duet with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
She was fifth in the salt program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Croyter is in favour of Israel's assembly.
When the boy was only six, his mother decided to return to Israel.
By 2009, Dmitriy had become a champion of the country by 17 years of age.
That same year he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croyter also won the gold of Singapore’s young Olympic Games.
In addition to high-rise landings, Demetry takes care of leaps and three-way leaps.
Albert's 31-year-old is another member of Hasavürt who, after long statements for Russia, decided to change his sporting citizenship.
Unlike Batirov, however, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, however, he advocated the Krasnoarska School of Higher Sports, even becoming a champion of the country in 2011.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the U.S.S.S.'s collection of volleyball, Jaroslav Antonova.
Just one year before the birth of the son of Jaroslav, he was recognized as the world’s best volleyball player.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
There was a family there and a permanent residence.
In 2015, he became a bronze prize on the territory of his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994, and he and his family were in the very midst of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to immigrate.
Norway was a primary target, but it was not possible for the northern country to go to France, Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to study the free struggle.
Soon, he won the prime of peace amongst his youth, and later became a member of the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France for the struggle tournament.
And once again, free struggle, and once again a former Russian man.
This time we're talking about a North Ossetian who emigrated to Spain, Tymuras Freiva.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and he is currently in favour of the country ' s assembly team.
Before that, it is true that 30-year-old athletes have also had high results in Russia.
It became a bronze pool for the 2007 and 2008 championships.
The suspension from the assembly, Tymuras, decided to change sports citizenship.
Our last list is a Bohemian boxer born in 1995 in the capital city of Dagestana Mahakula, Arthur Biarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, the parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began to do boxing.
Arthur has since become Canada's champion and in 2012 has become a world champion for young people.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first of his new homeland since 1975.

Why do children go to school for fairy tales?
According to Governor W. Condratiev, "the sayings need to be brought up, not by actions and parades, but by systematically."
They must grow and realize, at least from the age of 7, that they are fairy tales and education.
But in the meantime, I think this work is being done formally and I suspect it's more on paper.
If the Casachio classes absorb all the positive things they've accumulated in the past, at a qualitatively new level, I'd be glad to do.
If everyone's drunk and we don't know how, the new idea will turn out to be a cheap populism.
The SCF continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country ' s economy.
There is a ceiling on the funds allocated to the utility sector from different levels of budgets.
According to the Genocurate, high tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of JCH.
As a result, over 170 million roubles were paid by consumers of the region.
On the days and days before the Krasnodar Prosecutor's Office, there was evidence of unmerited costs to be included in tariffs.
In addition, 4 million roubles have been laid on the OOL costs of “Li-Consampling” (by supplying cold water) for the rental of cars at a price higher than the market.
Such examples are country-by-country.
The people pay the last money for the company, and they pay the right money, according to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is charged directly with several articles of the Penal Code: waste, legalization of proceeds obtained by criminal means, abuse of authority, etc.
According to a case of investigation, as the head of the city repair fund, Makarov entered into contracts with entrepreneurs and actually did not work on them, but was paid.
Businessmen just gave him most of the money back.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers didn't pay and spend it on their own needs.
As a result, the budget and the residents are millions of roubles.
The Makarov pattern, a skill typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions by the leaders of the KK, who paid the money to the citizens.
The trial of A. Kohan in Kamchatka is ongoing, by the way, also being charged with rouble 91.7 million.
On the basis of the investigation, in 2012-2013 in Elysno Kamchatka, it established 6 company managers and established 3 restricted societies.
One of them carried out contractual work for the UC, and two others played the role of construction centres, i.e., they took money from the population.
But with energy, A. Cohan did not list the funds, but spent on himself, my love.
It's going to be quite difficult to judge in the JCK area.
Business won't get excited, it won't take long.
And "helps" in this extremely confusing housing legislation, says Svetlana Disruptive, the NP's executive director, "JMC Verification".
We are not able to work on one law, as we suppress a new one that must force the previous to work.
There are also few JCF specialists, including among judges.
Lawyers themselves recognize that very little attention is being paid to housing law at university level.
Failure to initiate criminal proceedings has also been reported in the Office of the Attorney-General ' s Office.
The number of crimes committed in 2015 is less than half.
On the other hand, the investigation was long and one fifth suspended due to the failure to establish the accused person.
Often, shortcomings in law enforcement activities are identified as gaps in existing legislation.
The law exists, but the investigative authorities do not rush to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were approximately 230 reports of counterfeiting, only 60 criminal cases being initiated.
During the 5 months of the current year, there was only a slight increase of 99.
What is the falsification of the housing record?
This means that home-management change, financial and other issues bypass ownership.
And that also means that housing and utilities can't be marketed by normal companies that want to work fairly rather than "do" to the population.
So it happens that the people in the mouse, the small and medium business, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such throughout the State, Mr. Anton Jarkov, a member of the Committee on Property Matters.
This work is now active.
It's not just a single action, it's a targeted course against corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, the capital smells of scandals.
Why is there no scandal in Moscow in the area of JCK, like in many other regions?
'Cause the capital government has displayed iron will and ordered order,' said AIF Anatoli Vrebl, a member of the Committee of the State Committee on Security and Countering Corruption.
I mean the human resources issue, the legislative amendments, and the legal education.
Managers of companies are subject to close surveillance and all of them through licensing.
Resident complaints are quickly resolved in the public space (and the appeals of residents and the response is placed on the Government of Moscow portal).
Many do not just pay for monthly receipts, but they carefully observe what the house says.
Awareness among the population of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource owners and managers is very high.
The Plus Moscow test the validity of housing-community tariffs - a large proportion of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
It's probably all this together, explaining a calm atmosphere in Moscow.
Is everything at the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe it's nice to change your job.
Turkish Humbit.
Would Erdogan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the United States?
President Regep Taip Erdogan of Turkey offered the United States an ultimatum to make a choice between Turkey and Fechullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of the coup d ' état.
He said so by addressing his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to renounce support for a “terrorist organization of the Fethulachists”.
This is not the first Turkish statement calling for a change of position.
Experts believe that the split between Turkey and the West is growing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“Rano or later America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO” (Fethulachist Terrorist Organization).
Either the setting-up of the coup d ' état, or democratic Turkey.
She has to make this choice," quotes the Anatolia Agency as Erdogan's address on Wednesday night in Ankara.
The President of Turkey again, but more severely, demanded that the United States comply with his demands for the first time since the rebellion was suppressed.
We recall that on the night of 16 July, Turkish army high-ranking representatives in Turkey attempted to overthrow legitimate power in the country and attempted to kill the head of State.
However, after Recep Erdogan had treated the population, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
A total of 8,000 people were suspected, including teachers and scientists other than the military.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fechulah Gülen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
Also, Erdogan’s supporters admitted that American men could be involved in the coup.
In addition, the Panel recommends no award of compensation in the amount of US$ 400 million for all of the claims made in its address to Gulena and suggested that the tone be changed.
The last statement made by the representatives of the State of Gosdep on this matter was made at the time of the visit of Erdogan to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
This does not stop the President of Turkey, however, but he insists on his own and also makes demands on other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations as part of the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not set a date for the lifting of visa restrictions on Turkish nationals”, stated the EU Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Chelik, on 9 August.
He said that the changes made by Ankara to the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe ' s own security.
Let us note that on 1 August, Ziegmar Gabriel, German Vice-Centre of Germany, demanded Turkey to stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders for migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were answered by the corresponding statement made by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mevulta Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Tzevushoglu made the past Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not exclude that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance unless it received the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence is not a step against NATO.
"There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign States in the defence field -- missiles are imported," said Thuvushoglu in an interview with Andolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system based on its technology, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
“To date, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have been looking for others”, the Minister said.
Experts believe that this reflects Turkey ' s serious differences with the West and the country ' s shift to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Experts, Evgeni Minchenko, believes that Rejep Erdogan is now playing his own game and is unable to go so far as to go through a hard confrontation with the West.
It has a lot to do with the West, both in terms of business, and in terms of military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining a framework with the West.
Although, of course, Americans would be better able to see a fully obedient person on this post,” explained AIF.ru.
He said that it would be necessary to press the Turkish leader (on non-payment of EU compensation, demand for a spotless space with Europe and issue Gülen from the United States) after his statements.
"Regep Erdogan will face the deterioration of relations both with America and with the European Union, and they will press upon him on humanitarian issues, dictatorial methods of government, and so forth," says Minsk.
The head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, admits that the President of Turkey is changing his view with Russia as soon as it benefits him.
Eight months ago Erdogan took an extremely harsh position with regard to Russia and sought favor in the West by all means.
In a very short time, things changed to the opposite.
The guarantee that after a while the President of Turkey has not changed his priorities again is no.
I think Erdogan entered the period of shuttle diplomacy.
When he gets between the two poles, the West and Russia, he'll try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Muhammad says.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to retain political power in the country, which is precisely why he needs Russia and the partnership with Vladimir Putin so that the United States can stop supporting Gulena.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which control the situation in Syria and the Middle East through it.
Therefore, there will be a consensus with Turkey,” the expert considers.
Anna Glasov, head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East.
Today, both Turkish and EU relations with the United States are rather tense, and this is primarily linked to the domestic policy of Erdogan in person.
I believe that this crisis in relations will be exacerbated, and, against the backdrop of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will attempt to re-load policies both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, state that they are prepared to change their position on a number of Syrian issues, have resolved relations with Israel, and are actively engaged in political interaction with Iran,” explained AIF.ru Glasov, allowing the next step of Erdogan to normalize relations with Egypt.
She said that the policy being pursued by Erdogan was that of returning to the course of the foreign political concept that Turkey had followed prior to the Arab revolution.
Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region, with “no problems with its neighbours” positions.
The President of Turkey has now made very good visits to Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's position on both the regional and international levels,” the expert said.
Glasgow believes that returning Turkey to its former relations with the EU will be incredibly difficult, rather than starting to respond rigidly to Turkey, which may go to opening the borders for migrants and thus pose serious problems for Europe.
Junior doctors: appeals to new collective protests
The junior doctors asked the union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over the new employment contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Associate Physicians Committee (JDC) intends to request its full advice to support more collective protests from the beginning of September.
JDC said the Ministers could not answer the questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the work contract agreed with BMA.
It rejected 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter Thursday evening, JDC Chairman Ellen McCorth said that the Government had continued to “servely silence” about the problems that she had said had led to the rejection of the contract of employment.
She said: “In view of the prevailing situation, JDC leader voted for the rejection of the proposed new employment contract in full size and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues.”
In response to the Government ' s silence, JDC leader today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to endorse a continuous programme of collective protest, beginning in early September.
The dispute led young doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
Dr. Joan Malwana, the head of the BMA junior doctors, resigned after voting to cancel the agreed conditions of employment that BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the transaction was a good one to be made during the assembly in advance of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract would be used for medical personnel in England.
Russia and Turkey, "Aljans the bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake their hands and to declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the gilded palace in St. Petersburg, I had the steady impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked tense, and he hardly got the heat out, even according to his own reasonable standards.
In contrast, Regep Taip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his “approach second” to Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I've lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis levels but even to higher levels.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was going to be the opposite.
But the prolonged coolness from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first cause of the crisis he mentioned in his opening remarks was that Turkey had hit off the Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was ridiculous.
Mr. Putin was angry with the Tyradium, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
Injury was even stronger on the basis of an alleged friend.
The restoration of real confidence will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months the State-controlled media carried out a shocking, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were supposed to be guilty of anything.
The most serious allegations were that Mr. Erdogan ' s own family had relied on the illegal trade in oil from Syria ' s so-called Islamic State-controlled zones.
He denied it strongly.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Mr. Putin received the apology he required from President Erdogan.
Russia may have claimed to win a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire announcement are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost pulled off his position last month when he tried to make a coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shook him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have severely affected — especially the ban on charters, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number fell by almost 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, the tour operators and charterers here, of course, are relieved when the flights finally resume.
They're putting the end of the season on the Mediterranean.
Even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"The students are there, the tomatoes are back here," as the report said in the newspaper of Vladies.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
An anchor of evil in the West for what she believes to be a weak answer to the coup attempt.
Add to this the prolonged frustration of the turtle at the pace of joining the EU and Mr. Putin’s step, which seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually disrupt Turkish ties to the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the honorary points with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities following the attempted coup d ' état.
Have in mind, this is something for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So the summit at this brilliant seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as “alians bad: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are uniting forces.
However, despite the public demonstration of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently identified itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
Perhaps it is self-executing that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two Presidents gave a press conference, they did not even address this issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and taking into account the possibility of a complete catastrophe when NATO member Turkey hit a Russian jet fighter — it is better that two leaders at least speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be classified as a bec-off, according to the bank executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's global ambitions.
The Bank had retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used RBS to protect other consumer brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship aid for international sport, from the Cuban National Park to the championship of Humbledon Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is appropriate to allow more national brands to take the lead.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the office of the outside and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ultra Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for banking of individuals who will have more influence -- Coutts, Adam & Coo, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during the tour of clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He said BBC Scotland, "Brand RBS will eventually be our investment brand and the subject where our staff are going to be employed, because we are now more of a brand bank."
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, the RBS has become a global brand.
I'm saying that we no longer have a global desire, we have a local desire.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the six-State Cup, and it increases the profile of various brands in the sponsoring of sport.
"This is the right time for us to move a brand bank because the basis (we asked ourselves) is how we focus on improving the customer bank?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great customer bank and close all those brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on the customer needs, not our own, I think, you see a lot of changes.
We can return those brands again, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettores to 3,000 winners winning Newmarke on the Passage.
Children spray champagne after a double in Newmark brings it up to 3,000 wins
Zjaja Frankie Dettore achieved his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track -- the Passion taught by John Gudden.
Italian, a 45-year-old, is a sixth-year-old who has reached this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
He's followed by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Idderi and Willy Carson.
The three-fold champion of the frigginal Detto, who used to win the ghayar, said, "It's something special."
I'm really excited because my family's here too.
I'm really glad this happened in Newmark because this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big world event; it's not a Royal A directed, it's a regular Friday night of 20000 people.
I'm free from business and I'm very unsavory.
Children get applause when they get predisposition after victory
Two jockeys have reached such a stage in obstacles: the champion Richard Johnson, and the retired 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4,300 for a record career.
Lester Pyggott, nine-fold Derby winner, 4,493 winners
Frankie is one of the best hustlers of modern times, and it is not surprising that he reached this mark that was so few before him.
He's smart and strong, but it's his tactical laugh that makes him different from the others in the spring room.
He's an excellent representative for jumps, his enthusiasm and charisma have been attracting fans into the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago, at Epsom, he would bring 6,000 winners if he hadn't been just a hustler for the weekend and a big jump!
And seriously, Frankie brought the winners to Britain for over 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character that's good for British jumps, but he's also an incredible stomach.
Frankie Dettors celebrated this distinguished branded horse jumper.
From quick finish to quick jumps, Frankie Dettoor is a symbol of British smooth leaps for two decades.
They were takeoffs and falles.
Many of the winners of the big leaps, including his famous Great Semerca in Ascot, in 1996, but he also experienced a plane crash and was disqualified by doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month discrimination, but he demonstrated a tremendous willpower to challenge skeptics and to get back into shape.
And he may not have finished for some time, as the children said earlier that they would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Putin resigns the head of the administration, Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivan was part of Putin’s trusted neighbouring circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was now appointed environmental and transport representative.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “has decided to release Ivanov from his duties the head of the Russian administration of the President”, but has not given a reason.
Deputy Mr. Ivanov has been appointed his successor since 2012.
Mr. Waino, 44, former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in the capital city of Estonia and was a member of the Tokyo Embassy of Tokyo at the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations.
He was later the head of the office of the President ' s and the Government ' s apparatus, reporting the Kremlin website (in Russian).
At the time of his appointment, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your work as Head of State in drafting laws and in monitoring how your directives are being implemented.
Putin told one Russian television channel, on Friday, that Ivanov had asked him to resign from his post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Do Smiles Convince?
This is the move that troubled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin and, like him, has served in the Soviet Security Service, KGB.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on State television, both men stated that the head of administration had resigned on his own.
Despite the smiles on the camera, this has convinced little of us — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, is that the unforeseen consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But a formal statement — that a person once abhorred as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russian environmental policy — was met with a great scepticism.
In Putin's comments, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It's true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me this very difficult position, even, to say, a challenging post, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was the president of the President's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He used to serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service of the CGB, as was Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced KGB, Ivan was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivan one of the five people he trusted most.
Once thought that Ivanov could be President of Russia after Putin's second term, because Putin's third term would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, this position was occupied by another close supporter, Putin, Demetrius Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
From there, Thomas Gibson was fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was a member of last month's business at a show in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Telecom Studios, who produce serials, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences between filming and differences of opinion.
I regret that this happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how the Gibson character will be removed from the show, which monitors the FBI agent team, is expected to be done later, according to statements ABC Studios and CBS Television Studies.
A 54-year-old actor who had previously played a leading role in the city of Darma and Greg was on the show since the first season in 2005.
“I love to think like a criminal and put my heart and soul into him for the last twelve years,” said Gibson in his statement issued on Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of my life, but now it's not possible.
I just want to thank the scriptists, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, most importantly, the best fans that the show could only dream of.
It is scheduled that the show will return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
Myth: Fish landed in the garden of Banffa
A Buffalus man asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banffa.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish could be sands left behind by water death.
Bane, 500 meters from the sea, took a survey of the spectacle at Periscop, hoping that someone could shed light on two-in-a-half fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Most is now connected to Faif
The $1.35 billion project now has 2017 to be completed
Engineers connected the North Passage and the Quinsferry Crossing Viac, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fire.
This is the first of the four interfaces between the "veeras of the canvas" that are now approaching the completion of all three pilots of the bridge.
The Bridge Section from Faif is now 600 metres long and weigh 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of concrete and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 per cent of the bridge.
The $1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by my 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Kit Brown, visited the area today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of Queensferry Crosssing.
We're all witnesses of engineering art on a really epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete were used to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the gap between the bead and the bridge canvas is an extremely accurate operation using extremely precise assembly tolerances.
A total of about 79% of the entire bridge canvas is now in place, and for the last section of the canvas, the concrete surface is being transferred to Rosati today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to be moved up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, the project director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said, "The first wreath on every draft bridge is always a milestone.
In this amazing project, this blurring is the most modern construction art.
Following the installation of the last section of the road cloth and its connection with the expanding North Pilot Road Line, we were then left to close the remaining gap in the north — or facing the shore — on the side.
This was done by stretching out the northern approach by 700 millimetres to the south.
It was a big operation at the same time a very impressive one.
Large, because it was 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised to an angle of about 3 per cent.
Prominent because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny — just a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Salvation in the Bay of Molfre:
Three men' had the chance to be alive after being thrown out of a fishing boat in England.
The Mailfre RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 13.20 a British summer time on Friday, after the team saw the accident unfolding in the Gulf of Molfre.
Three men tried their best to reach safety while their boat continued to move.
"We saw their ship circle alongside them and assumed the worst," said the steering lifeboat Melfre Vince Jones.
"Shappily, by the time we were down on the water, a strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and a third man, 60 years old, was found to be exhausted and caught in a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all raised aboard the coastal lifeboat and delivered to the rescue station.
He said, "The three men who had been thrown into the water were lucky that they were alive and completely innocent.
The engine of the boat had an emergency blower, but it somehow pulled away from the man driving the boat when it woke up.
Somebody chose these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a decent hunting for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer walk out the street to play, preferring to spend their free time watching screens, has been a complaint for many in the past decade.
Pakemon Go takes people from the couch and engages in some kind of physical activity.
The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then to video games, and recently, smartphones.
It's so good to see that technology and activity on the street aren't mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to the full-fledged training that Pokémon Go is receiving, based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (the result of which was a series of cartoons, playing cards and other responses).
Like many other pop cultural phenomena, all of this has become obsolete a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries was detained at the time because of the massive response that overloaded the servers.
In days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, smartphone players are going to look for Pokemons that are tracked on GPS and discovered could be photographed, "because of the screens on your phone" or "snuckle".
A generation that played a game of less, joined the payload, drifting away from the couches to look for.
In the United States, playing has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the “normal” person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, the Apple Watch application, which monitors 35,000 users, recently reported that within two days from the start of the game, the number of people who were tracked, who were performing 30 minutes a day, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, but it just sees the initial level data.
Many health campaigns that convince people to “at least 30 minutes,” “get off the couch,” and “be active every day” have not received a response because most health-care messages are boring and say words to people who look miserable.
However, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regular practicers reduce the chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps weight correction, high arterial pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she pulls people out in the street to do what they love.
Thus, three basic health frameworks are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight, and joy.
Some people even make new hunting friends.
As usual, there are boring shutters who are looking for a welcome.
And yes, someone can get caught on the door.
So what?
The breakthrough happened.
After all, even though smartphone applications like Fitbit could still track our physical activity, they didn't give us a reason for class, like this game does.
News will grow, and use will weaken over time.
However, the success of Pokemon will result in more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simon Bails wins the gold of absolute permanence in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the mess.
Simon Bails is not immune to all of this.
It's a dynamic on the back of the jump.
Uninvited on the log.
It's groovy on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic Championship.
A 19-year-old American giant rose to the title of a championship on Thursday, putting the gap between himself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration by the fitting Olympic attention.
Her total score of 62.98 was sufficiently far from the silver medal and a comrade on El Riceman's "Fining Five" and the Russian bronze medalist Ali Moustafina.
Bails, from the United States, serves as a gymnastic log at the finish of women's absolute permanence in artistic gymnastics on the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bails became the fourth consecutive American woman who won the title of the champion of absolute firstry and fifth in general, establishing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps at any time.
She burst into tears when she was shown her final general score and her long journey by this point ended.
This achievement places her in the same league as very rare passenger athletes, such as Michael Pheps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Bails spent the last three years dominating his sport by winning 15 medals of the World Championship - including 10 gold programs - with such obsessive programs in their mixture of labour and accuracy that Mary Lou Retton, a 1984 Olympic champion, described her as “the greatest gymnast I have ever seen”.
One last test was in Brazil, the competition was not so great between Bails and others in this field, but between her and the weight of overestimated expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be viewed as an unreasonable expectation.
Simon Bails, from the United States, left, and Eli Riceman are hugged after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the final phase of the female individual absolute permanence on the artistic gymnast at the Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Bails earned the first gold on Tuesday, became a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of the retired coordinator of Martha's national assembly.
While Bails insisted that she had never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that's not the case.
A part of her program of free exercise — including her firm passage — is set up in Latin music, which would go directly to houses outside of the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl adopted by her grandfather and grandmother as a child begins to walk and the open mother of trainer Amy Burman on a visit to the room where Burman was a trainer became a force.
It hasn't lost a single absolute-version competition since summer 2013, a lucky lane that should last as long as Bails wants it.
Although Mustafina won a little advantage with two branches, it was a mirage.
The transparent log and the free exercise — where Bails defends the name of the champion of the world — lie in ambush.
It moved forward again with 15.433 on the log and ended with 15.933 on the floor.
Riceman hugged her as they waited for the final account — a pure formality — and tears appeared around a brilliant red and white and blue eye drive for Bails when the purpose she had once set up in the album for the cut was realized.
Raisman's speech was a little revenge for what happened four years ago when she divided the third place, but lost the Mustafina bronze on the Thai-breath.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of a team that Americans call "baby" was far ahead.
It had given a kiss to the crowd after its voluntary exercise, which at times seemed to be in question.
As for Bails, 19-year-old virus Twitter from the beginning of this week is now completely new:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case were shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who were killed during the most deadly attack in the case of Finix's first serial killer in the last decade were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Lyner, Stephanie R. Allis and daughter of Allis, Mali, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the carriageway, the authorities stated.
The perpetrator fired approximately eight rounds from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the vehicle and then running onto another vehicle, in a report.
The police claim that the triple murder does not seem to be a result of robbery, as the perpetrator did not take a wallet or $2,900 that had been at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
The Finix Police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting had led the investigators to check if he had been involved in the previous four attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"It's happening in the residential neighborhood in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, the affiliate of CBS, earlier this month.
A suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including brown Nissan of the late 1990s, black BMW of the late 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked to each other and were committed by the same murderer.
Allis, 33 years old, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Lainer, 31 years old, and Allis' daughter, Mali, were killed at the scene.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car while listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup half an hour before the three-hour murder, and which is believed to be the work of a serial killer.
The investigators found the Giles and removed the bullet from the seat and fragments of the bullets from the engine compartment.
A 6-year-old mother with a microcephal:
As most six-year-olds, Edmund Picsito likes drinking and toys and, of course, her mother.
But unlike most of her peers, Edmund has microcephalus, which is the result of a genetic violation that his mother Elizabeth Pictito did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
What really isn't true is, of course, you're going to sign on it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested placing him in a specialized medical facility.
'My first answer was, 'I didn't think people were doing that',' explained Piccalito.
Edmund walks with a skates.
Edmund didn't sit down and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But it's slow going through some stages.
He goes for help on his own and rides a bicycle.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund made for "please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," said Pictito CBS News.
But not just the ordinary sign language — she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalia may result from a number of different circumstances: genetics, such as Edmund’s, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zica.
Symptoms and projections may vary considerably.
It is too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zica virus.
Pixsoto remembers the emotional loss of an uncertain future.
Did I tell you what would happen all the time?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime forecast, because I don't expect anyone to really get to tell me.
But Pixsoto has an encouraging advice for mothers of babies with congenital defects because of Zica.
It's getting better.
You know everything's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, floods are the cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Missouri
The heavy rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare the state of emergency Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state until Saturday inclusive.
The National Meteorological Service reported the numerous rivers south-east of Louisiana and south of the Mission to be removed from the coast and threatened by large-scale flooding following extreme rainfall.
Governor Luiziana John Bell Edwards stated that government officials were in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance had already gone to the affected approaches.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Office of the Governor of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests for transportation for high water, boats and sandbags were received.
Steele said that it was the Tanjipajoa's arrival that invited tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The danger of flooding remains valid until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an extra three to five inches could rock the area.
In southern Alabama, the rains continued to flow in the Mobila area, while the flood subsided until Friday.
The Comet River next to Baton-Rose and the Amitt River next to Dan Springs, both in Louisiana, were forecast to have set a flood record last weekend.
The synoptic Alec Krautmann said that the two rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Ruz.
He also said that the flood flowing down as far as Assensen's arrival was concerned was a threat, as those retreating rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morep.
The Ticfo River, just south of the State of Missouri in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest of ever recorded levels at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescue workers were still pulling people out of the floods in the Amitt and Wilkinson districts in the south-west of Missouri.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and pasture were among the rescued early Fridays at Gloucter.
Hansford, 62 years old, says that the Biver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He said that another pasture that lived near had warned him.
"We have woke up and the water has continued to come on," said Hansford.
She reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford it's the largest tributary she's ever seen in 48 years that lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family were disabled, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the rescue service saved all three by means of an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they had been hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says the flood is “immediately spreading” as the rain continues, noting that the officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says that one observer near Livingstone reported falling 13.75 inches of rain from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil was moved by rainfall from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets have resulted in work to rescue residents from their homes at Tanjipahoa ' s arrival and the abolition of education in five school districts, and the authorities have stated.
WWL, branch of CBS, reports that the adviser to Tanjipaha described 200 flooded houses.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both of them are now drowning.
The President of the arrival, Robbie Miller, stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets in high water.
The shelters were opened in the town of Amit and Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
"They'll have an opportunity to come home as soon as the water starts to back away," he said.
In Hammond, Tanjipahoa ' s arrival, about two dozen streets were closed because of the high level of water, and sand bags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep the water far from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lake Landram, city manager.
It's on the way to be like that.
In Missouri, Harrison County, Rupert Laisi, head of the Emergency Service, reported that the heavy rain continued to flow on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that several houses had been registered as flooding on Thursday, but none had been registered on Friday.
Kate Tousson, the head of the Chopper Value Foods store in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Tuusson said, "and she's still on the ground."
Mahzaz Brown 6, "grunted bullets" remains alive after shooting in Philadelphia.
Police reported shooting a 6-year-old boy in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting in a 6-year-old town this week.
His grandmother and grandfather identified him for CBS Philly as Mahaz Brown.
Grandma and Grandpa are told that Brown sustained numerous gunshot wounds, including his smell, leg, arm and belly, but was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He's got a lot of money, his little body has been removed by bullets," says his grandmother Delírès Melandez, the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to be well.
He was supposed to go to the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the Germantun district.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were registered stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot on the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old critical state, reporting the station.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been shot.
The investigators reported to CBS Philadelphia that there seemed to be a shooting between several armed people.
Helicopters from semi-automatic weapons, attributed to multiple copies of semi-automatic weapons, became operational.
This seems to have been a long-lasting battle.
There were nails on the street, on both sides of the pavement.
Therefore, it seems that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting,” the police commander Phildelfia Anthony Ginaldi reported to the station.
Many homes and cars in the area were also wounded.
No arrests have been made and the police reportedly screened the cameras.
Another six-year-old girl, a girl, was hit by a holster bullet on Tuesday when she played in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabbie, and Laurie?
That's what I call the women's Olympian collection for the gymnastics of this year and for a number of reasons.
First of all, I've been on every summer Olympiad since 1984, and the United States has never been that dominant.
And second, three gymnasts play a key role in this collection: Simon Bails, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laori Hernández, who have inspired so many white girls.
The composition of this collection, supplemented by Ali Riceman, which is a Jew, and Madison Cochan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This assembly looks like America at last.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of the sport.
During the last four years, the female gymnastic number one was an African American woman.
Last year Simon and Gabbie were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
In the last Olympics, Gabi Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed her.
Now the world could have been witnessing the incredible performances of the three-fold World Cup Simon Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernández, performing unexpected but nevertheless groovy gymnastic exercises.
On the Thursday of Simon, he became the fourth consecutive American who won the gold in a woman’s individual absolute birth.
And Ali Riceman's colleague made silver.
We're seeing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like this in the gymnastic sections throughout the country.
Simona, Gabi and Lori all took the same path as Ali and Madison to form an Olympic assembly.
They're the final heel, because the next Olympic gymnastic assembly will have only four gymnasts on the team, and that's the last year Martha Karoli's training.
But in reality, gymnastics is a expensive sport, and the gymnasts are first trained in private gymnasts, supported by parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, contributions for competition, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasiums and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnast clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are located where the gymnasts get everything they can from their training, and this is the expensive and long-term responsibility for the gymnasium families.
Amy Burman, coach Simona Bails, and Maggie Hani, coach Laurie Hernández, both trained their athletes since they went to the gymnastics.
We must create more affordable training at the cost and accessible gymnastics to the communities of a vast number of young girls inspired by Simona, Gabbie and Lori.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics courses in Harlem for over 15,000 young people in urban areas (mainly blacks and Latin Americans) and have raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Hymnasticism develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to exhausting work, discipline and mental resilience.
This combination has a lifelong positive effect on good health, school success and work.
It is the inspiration of this collection that will send thousands of girls to take on gymnastics, which is beautiful.
Sports is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabbie and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in winning command Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors started to declare further strikes after the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's offer
The Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on changes by agreeing to a modified contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the contract, said NHS was on no land, and any subsequent delay would damage staff and patients.
The first assistant doctors have been converted to a new contract, which includes night work and weekend changes in order to improve services during extra-curricular hours.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA Young Doctors Committee last night, said in a statement: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly”.
It was only eight weeks before the first team of doctors were transferred to a new contract, that there was a need for progress and time for withdrawal.
An attempt by the IA to resolve the dispute was met with a reluctance to take action and, at times, with total silence by the Government.
And that despite Jeremy Hunte's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jermi Hunte needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the fears of the younger doctors.
If he does not, then it is clear that junior doctors are willing to organize further strikes.
At the end of April, the last glass was delayed by some 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nurses ' receptions, while nurses and consultants were engaged to ensure that doctors were replaced by a pick-up line.
The Ministers hoped to end the dispute on changes by agreeing on a modified contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
IAA wants a better holiday payment for 54,000 junior doctors, who will be subject to a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS Employers, encouraged junior doctors not to continue strikes.
Mortimer said, "Stars reach low or nothing, but exert pressure on already working teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, spouses and their families."
During the past two months, we have spoken with the Junior Physicians Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
The workers hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differentials in medicine, were a sign of the seriousness of employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions reached by the IIA in November, February and May.
A drug for 2 ? a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use the drug for 2 a day after the authorities have recommended it for a larger number of people and for a longer period of time.
The anti-retroviral drug reduces the risk of reoccupation for people with heart disease.
The drug has already been appointed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new attack.
The NICE supervision service of the National Health Service of Great Britain has advised that it be given to people for four years to continue to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, now the NICE supervision service of the National Health Service of Great Britain has advised that it be given to people for four years to continue to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack will occur with some 140,000 people in England every year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of fleas.
If the beam breaks apart into pieces, it may lead to a tromba that blocks access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if it moves around, it can move through the blood flow and block the blood into the brain, causing a stroke.
People already under attack are at greater risk of getting another one.
Ticagrelore produced by the British firm AstraZeneca, sold as Brilyque, reduces the risk by making the trolls less likely.
The draft NICE regulation, now published, recommends that people be given 90 mg g thycalorre for 12 months, and then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention techniques with about a quarter of people who have had a heart attack, there will be another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative effect on the quality of life of a person.
There is evidence that the tecagrerere, coupled with aspirin, is at risk of further heart attacks and strokes among people who have experienced a heart attack.
With the prior recommendation of the tecalor, we are pleased to have the opportunity to increase treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of tecagrera — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than this time limit.
The PC has a culture that allows for falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim areas
Ex-Mer. Tauer-Hamletsa Lutfir Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption and served as the Government's report.
The culture of political adjustment has led to the closing of the eyes, which has turned out to be a widespread falsification of the vote in the Muslim communities, according to the Government ' s destructive report today.
The former Cabinet member, Sir Eric Pickles, is criticized by the police, election observers and urban administration for ignoring evidence of electoral irregularities because of “extreme sensitivity to race and religion”.
The former community secretary, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the religious intimidation of voters was such that the police should be allowed to set borders outside the polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take the identity papers to prove who they are when they vote.
To date, voters must simply state their name and address.
The report even proposes putting unfavoured ink on the fingers of people when they hand over their ballot papers to exclude anyone from having to vote twice.
It was necessary to provide better protection to the informants, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local Government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it”, he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a scandal in the Tauer Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the special court dealing with electoral matters held that the current Mayor of Luftur Rahman had to be removed from office in connection with the long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had “cynic distortion” of the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said that he had led his campaign based on the fact that it was the duty of the Muslims to vote in his behalf.
Up to 300 votes were doubted or were the result of the building of a person’s vote by someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the practice of voting by mail, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on the people to vote in favour of their choice.
Sir Eric, in the photos, made a number of recommendations to clean up the voting system, including the requirement to bring his identity card to prove who you are
It states: “There was evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote on the will of the elderly, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There were fears that... public institutions had closed their eyes to such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of the political adjustment to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from the post office ballot papers to stop “the harvest of votes”.
The report, while considering Theresa May, also calls for enhanced registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
An option is being considered to require those who vote to present their identity before the voting.
Use unfrozen ink on the fingers of people as soon as they drop their bulletin to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic examinations of people ' s nationality to make sure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year limit for automatic postal voting applications.
To prevent political participants and activists from working with balloted ballots and envelopes.
Give the police the power to set the boundaries around the polling stations.
Amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation against people under the submission of the People ' s Act 1983.
Illegally photograph the polling stations.
Require only English to be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff make the voices go one by one.
Sir Eric is furiously attacking the town police, claiming that it is “extremely” that no criminal charges have been brought following the Tauer-Hamlets case.
“The election court disqualified Lutfuhr Rahman and his agent for a long list of acts of corruption and unlawful conduct,” he said.
He was found guilty without reasonable doubt — the criminal standard of proof — for a number of reasons.
He also criticizes the fruitless “checkings on the heads” of the city administration's electoral registration offices.
Sir Eric said, "The past year's court ruling in Tauer Hamlets was a wake-up signal.
Our nation has a proud legacy as a mother of parliamentary elections, yet the disturbing and subtle spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Dressed by the bicycle analogue Kate and other double-educers of the Olympics in Rio
The Poulin Ferrand-Ervedo fanates 2016 in Rio this week went crazy on the French cyclist Paulin, which appeared to be an impressive look at the Duke of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old member of the Olympics is not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast about her own famous double -- at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people who are on our screens at the moment, F-NT have compiled a list of Olympics with more than a surface similarity to the Hollywood stars.
Observer and wolf: U.S. crew member Brady Allison, on the left, compared to Leonardo DeCaprio since he was a child
Besides the Kate doll on the bicycle track, a lot of people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be the twin of Leonardo DACRio's rivals.
A U.S. crew member of U.S. archer Brady Allison was responsible for a storm in Twitter, when pictures of him that looked more frighteningly like a Wall Street Star.
And in fact, the archer found out about social media insanity and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I personally do not see the great similarity, perhaps except vegetation on my face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt indicate even more this year: the striking similarity between the British suburb Greg Razarford and the popular actor Nill Patrick Harris.
Aliya Mustafina, a Russian gymnast with her very clear eyes, is said to be an exact copy of Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer.
In the basin of South Africa, Cameron Van der Burga was compared to the star Horus Matthew Morrison for many years.
Turning to a more unexpected one: This user believes that Nathan is the “disgusting version” of the actor Nasova.
Another long-standing comparison was between tennisist Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who may boast of similar heavy beams and lips.
The Russian silver medal, Yulia Efimov, may boast not only of the same black and bright hair as the actress Annalinn McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, says fans, resembles "Joseph Gorgon Levit".
Surgeon women: From the field of Hope Solo football to the left, and actress Jennifer Karpinter from Dexter, right, have the same form of face and eye.
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the same appearance of this pair.
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to announce that "the Internet is thinking that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpinter are really identical."
Indeed, the star of the U.S. football and the actress of Dexter have incredibly similar forms of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of Laura Linnie's actress, as well as the winning gold medal of the Gebby Douglas, which can boast of its own beautiful broad smile, which is similar to the smile of the star Gabriel Union.
Commentator Olympiad on CBC apologizes for talking about the Chinese fat that died as a pig
Analysis of Bairon McDonald's fourth anniversary on the 14-year-old Ai Yanhaang women's estaphet with a free-style 4x200 m of outrage on the Wednesday of the CBC in the direct broadcast of the Olympics
The Canadian CBC broadcast company was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that 14-year-old Chinese fish “old as a fire” and“ died as a pig” during a traffic accident.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he started expressing his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4-200-m free style.
You could hear McDonald being brought to a team of CBC commentators to "suffer her" and said, "This 14-year-old whale has dropped a ball, baby."
Too excited, too old as a warrior, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
A 14 - year - old Chinese catchr Ai Yanhan saild the second stage of the estaphet at 1:57.79 — one or two seconds slower than the Canadians of Taylor Rak, allowing Canadians to bridge the gap from China.
The audience throughout Canada responded quickly after being shaken by tone and expression
Emmett McFarlane said, "Is the CBC thing just said the 14-year-old caught from China died like a pig?"?
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yangan of China in the finals of the women's estaphet, 4 to 200 m with a loose style, they said, "This little 14-year-old whale has dropped a ball, baby."
Criticism in Twitter immediately struck Byron McDonald, with many calling for his release
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how unheard Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote, "There's nothing but #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was in charge of CBC, apologized in live air for McCondald's comment, stating: “We apologize for the comment on the voyage statement.
It was a bad word choice, we're sorry it happened.
SAF concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who responded to this statement
The friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald.
CBC then copied and sent their apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDald's comments
The body was also quick to apologize and to issue a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers on live air and to our social media subscribers.
Let us make it clear that Byron’s comments were viewed as peddling rather than as a person’s.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron deeply regrets what he said.
On Thursday afternoon McDonald apologized on live air and tried to clarify his comment, stating that he did not think that his words were interpreted as an attack on the person.
'I'd like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's essay,' he said at the CBC broadcast of the Olympic Games.
'I've been talking about speaking half-hearted, not speaking of her personally.'
'May be of course, there was no disrespect, and I am sorry.'
Primark's buyer offended a woman who's been no longer an example of the lower laundry in the middle of the store.
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman was naked to try to imitate the panties on the floor with the Primark store.
What's even worse, she's shown what she looked like, pulled them down, and put them back in the regiment.
She continued her search and eventually died four pairs of underwear at the Bowerie Place Trade Center in Volkton.
The Primark Trade Center in Volkton, where a woman was example of tripping panties before putting them back into the regiment
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after the example of the underwear, a mysterious woman again "married and walked out of the store, bought nothing."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the trading hall, she took a couple of panties out of the cane, took her own collars and panties off, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a place somewhere modest to do it -- she was just standing there homeless."
"Every time she took her panties off again, she obviously didn't like them because she put them back in the regiment."
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here she liked, dressed up again and out.
"It doesn't look like she was being cared for, who was watching her, or that she was thinking about the person who would eventually buy those panties that she showed."
Jenny Davidson's 33-year-old kid from Kent said, "It's no good to think someone's going to take home panties that someone else's worn and they weren't sweaty."
The accident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I'm concluding that the staff seem to have been trying to take these items out of the sale after she's gone -- well, that's the best.
"I wouldn't like to come home with a new pair of women's panties and find out that another woman did and took them off, and they weren't sweaty."
The representative of Primarck said, "Primark knows of the accident that happened at our Volkton store on Tuesday 9 August."
All the goods in question were seized from the sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks by using a tailor.
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Misozchi, the master of the Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a nearby distance.
Whether it comes to you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to hit a robber of his weapons.
If they come up from behind, according to Israel, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and “Free the line of fire”.
Then you press the gun between your forearm and your shoulder to hit them in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee is turned into the scent, and while the attacker is in pain, you pull the gun out of his arms, hit him in the face with the gun, and back off, holding the weapon on him.
For an armed front, a method of execution similar to that of removing your body from the line of fire, quickly remove the gun and pull it out so that the thieves can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight onto the gun and hit the attacker with your fist in the chest, then turn the gun out of his touch before you step back and aim at him.

To the guideman, Jan Wright, a traveller uses his own tongue at the most filthy places in Europe
A British traveller was subjected to his immune system and a heavy reflex test, cutting down some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The lead and author of the travel books Jan Wright, 51, from Saffolka, conducted the language on the euro note, the perilam of the Piccadilli Circa, the button of the train's toilet and the Russian social telephone to prove the power of their immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a lumimeter to show himself and us what it was into.
But the experiment that has to be a film called "Lizina Traveller's Manual on Inner Force" has produced some surprising results.
The idea of cutting a wash button in a train that is used by thousands of others can be extremely disgusting, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During the entire European trip, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about the increase in in intestine bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his laziness brought him any more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright is known for testing her intestines for the strength of her intestines, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public peri on the railway station to the toilet-milk button, this task has certainly been tested by his immune system.
In a film that he filmed, he said, "From childhood on, I've been completely carefree of my health and I've been holding a lot of different things in my mouth from the ground eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty Russian public toilet.
His test dab demonstrated the value of a lumenometer of more than 4,000 units.
By comparison, the arms that have just been washed should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000, while his hands had just been washed less than 60
Wright and the Finnish milk producer Valio made a film on a travel guide called "Lizina Traveller's Manual on Internal Force" showing the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the toilet.
In a film, he said, "This is close to one of the worst things I smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything 'cause it's indecent.
The "Lizuna Traveller's Manual" was withdrawn along with the Finnish milk producer Valio.
The company provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestine bacteria and develop the immune system.
The Senior Vice President of Valio on bites, juices and new categories, Nico Wuorrenma, said, "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to watch at the same time could explain the benefits of the probiotic.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "call Jan."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the gut health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we have been able to provide users with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hacala, who was the director of the film, added: 'Let's say I'd lose respect for Jana if he cut off some of the things I asked for, for example, the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film.'
Of course, some of Jan's things were easier to lick, and some of them were quite rigid.
I'm glad we've managed to get some of these indoors on tape.
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of respondents linked oxygen-related bacteria exclusively to good stomach and intestinal conditions, while 58 per cent said they were using, at least sometimes, products containing added oxygen-adding bacteria.
The hoodlum family destroyed Saltat, Cornwall municipal home on the eve of the evictions
The hooligans left their municipal home with a loss of 50,000, after being evicted for intimidation by their neighbours.
Tanya Skaldon and her partner Sean Trebilko was expelled from their property facility to Saltat, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from a real estate facility, shocked housing cooperatives found the property in a state of repair.
The walls were left with blowing holes, the chaffs were hidden, the debris was scattered over the floor, and the walls were trampled on by graffiti.
The family is now displaced and is supposed to live in a private apartment
Donna MacEeva, a settler at the Cornwall House, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are many things that need to be weighed, because this real estate object is likely to be known as not a very good Cornwall aspect.
This family has the stupid glory, and their name is the stupid one.
The couple had three sons who lived in real estate from time to time, and the police reported that the kingdom of the horrors caused by the family had included fights on the street with baseball beatings, intimidation of people living in nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive shouting, squabbles and harassment.
Skaldon, 47 whose name was on a lease, got a warrant for antisocial behaviour in June.
In several rooms, a house that could be snowy found old garbage.
Sexboards in a home where drugs were sold in the past were torn out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Hosing forcibly evicted her and her partner this week after they were granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was facilitated by neighbors who said that their lives had been transformed into hell.
One said, "They weren't worried."
We've lived close to them for 20 years, and that's always been bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is incredible.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we weren't used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the neighboring team Cornwall Hosing, said that the family could not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in a house for 20 years, with the police, and was regularly summoned to the police
Musor and the old toys were spread down the older side of the municipal house.
He added: 'It's a shame that the lessee was unable to accept any responsibility for her and her family's behaviour, 'because eviction is always the latest method of action that the Cornwall House considers.
It was a very complex case, because the conduct was limited, and their actions must have been frightening to its observers.
I appreciate all the work my team, police, and members of the Devon and Cornwall community who spoke bravely to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and send a signal that social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three of them lived in a house at different times, but he said that they were all a little over 20.
Rough mattress left on the floor of one of the burned houses after eviction
The settlement workers would now have to clean up the garbage chest that surrounds the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as weights, supplies and 1,700 cash.
Skaldon was fined after he found himself guilty of taking class B drug in order to supply.
She claimed that the money was going to pay for her son, Lee Skaldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were filled with graffiti all over the surface.
Police said they'd try to evict tenants who were not subject to the lease regulations.
Angela Crowe, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said that the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel they can act without charges from the prosecutor, as well as those who are harming the conduct,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
The Portuguese tourists were terrified when the low-lying military aircraft barely touched the beach
In the city of Aveira, Portugal, tourists who loved sunflowering were frightened for their lives
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that it carried out a training flight but insisted on no security risk
This is the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic, while a low-lying aircraft has been sleeping over a crowded beach.
A military aircraft flying close to the range of hunters on a sand band in Aveiro, northern Portugal, is seen in dramatic numbers.
Responsives jumped on their feet as soon as they became aware of the noise of the aircraft’s engines but were unable to see what was moving towards them through the clouds.
An incident took place last night near the town of Aveira in Kosta Nova.
Daniel Fernandesh, one of the few relaxing people who published a video of a shocking passage in the social media, said, "He has flown very low twice, and there was a moment, at some point, that he seemed to be going to break."
Nino Arroga added, "I was serfing and I swear, it was like the plane was about to fall on me."
The tourists on the beach of Aveira were terribly scared when the plane came out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the P-3C Orion pilot had been flying a test flight to find fishing vessels off the coast, and had to descend so low that it was the only way to verify them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft had flown a little lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
During the summer, forest fires damaged mainland Portugal, as well as killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly as low as possible because of the dense fog and the potential from forest fires that had deteriorated the visibility of the pilot.
The plane was flying a training flight, and the pilot was assigned to locate fishing boats within the target
HASSSP has been mandatory for more than a year, but most of the cafes and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet entered it.
The checks are becoming more active, and the business faces fines of up to 1 million roubles.
For more than a year now, the Hazard Analysys and Critic Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HASSS) - Risk analysis and critical control points - are mandatory for the use of food by manufacturers and carriers, as well as by companies in the general hospital in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TS).
The Russuben business check of compliance with those standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
In the meantime, however, officials only issue fines for individual breaches of the regulations (see “the list of documents”).
In general, however, the failure to comply with the rules would cost an enterprise of 600,000 roubles for the first violation and one million roubles for the second.
CHASS, as a system that takes into account food risks and prevents them, was developed in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of an astronaut's food.
The system is now being used for all food industries not only in the United States but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, CHASS has been operating in TC territory.
There were four years for business development and implementation (the requirement of CASES appeared in TC regulations in 2011).
Employers and officials, however, admit that most companies have not even heard of the rule.
Unfortunately, we had been sure for a long time that the rule applied only to food productions, not to reporters, which we explained to the head of the Public Council of Elena Ceders.
Now everyone's trying to make a mistake.
The expected deadline for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey, at the end of August, beginning in September.
But the supply demand will not be met, because their target audience, the families with the children, is already preparing for the school, is observing experts.
The Alliance of Tourism Agencies addressed a letter yesterday to the Government requesting the permission of charterers.
“For many Russian tourists, the question of selecting quality and affordable sea rest is indisputable, as most facilities are already stored before the end of September in the resorts of Krasnodar and the Republic of Crimean,” notes the authors of the letter and emphasizes that the opening up of charters in August has not significantly affected the demand for Russian sea tur products.
In the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Turkish Industry (RCT) it has been reported that if Russian and Turkish airlines agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when the charter will resume, until now, depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technical aircraft can fly in September, even in August, if the tour operators quickly build the programmes and agree with airlines on the right direction on board,” says Paul Ruments, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office of the RTA.
He said that the possible resumption of charters was good news, but it would not have a very good effect on the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - were already getting back from rest and preparing for school or spending vacations in other countries.
Travelers and couples buy the tours during the bad season.
Draft programmes can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously,” says Paul to the Romanians.
"There's a chance in Turkey to attract many tourists if it now makes a very budget offer of 50,000 roubles per tour on two occasions, because there are people who wait for very cheap tours," says Valérie Rosenthal, Director-General of the Ortio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is certainly not worth the effort to count on dosage - the bulk of travel is already planned.
Paul also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charterers will be sought, but do not wait.
"For Turkey to launch charters now, this is a rehearsal of the next season," says Paul Rumens.
The opening of charters in Turkey is a positive news for the next season, and it is agreed by Valery Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for exemption from the NPFL for compensation payments established by law within the framework of approved rules for compensation for damage caused by injury or other health damage.
The issuance of milk to workers working in hazardous work conditions is provided for under article 222 TC of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the rules and conditions for extradition are laid down by Order No. 45n of the Russian Ministry of Development of 16.02.2009.
According to this document, workers are provided free of charge with milk or other equivalent foods during the day of actual employment in hazardous jobs because of harmful production factors in the workplace.
On the basis of the above standards, the Commission of Russia concluded in the letter under consideration that, on the basis of abs. 2 p. 3 of article 217 of the CCF, income in the form of milk granted to employees during the day of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions, in accordance with the regulations and conditions approved by the Order of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
The Moscow Gastrobank was left without a CB license.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew a licence to bank with the Endowment Commercial Bank, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the ACS “GASTHOBNK” has been implementing a highly-oriented credit policy related to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
Adequate risk assessment at the request of the oversight body and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank ' s assets gave rise to reasons for the credit organization ' s implementation of measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the loan company was involved in doubtful transit operations.
A temporary administration has been assigned to the bank until the time of appointment to a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive branch of the credit organization under federal law are suspended.
ASB "GUSTBACK" is a member of the Investment Insurance System.
Let us recall that the payment of insurance benefits to bank depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Law No. 177-FZ, on the insurance of personal deposits in the banks of the Russian Federation, amounts to 100% of the balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles, together with one investor.
Payments, according to the Investment Insurance Agency, will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the reporting data, the ACS assets “GUSTICANK” as at 1 August 2016 occupied 335 seats in the FRF banking system.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS died in Syria
Kadiza Sultan, one of three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join ISIS, was reportedly killed in Syria.
Tasmanian Akundji's lawyer stated that her family had learned of her death in Rock, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is believed that she died of a Russian air strike in Rakka, covering the group in the country, according to ITV News on Thursday.
She was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
“It is only to be hoped that the only advantage of this is to threaten and persuade others that these are the risks involved in the journey to the war zone to persuade people to make the same choice at any time,” Acundji said.
In February 2015, he and two other students from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then to a bus to the Syrian border.
The Soultana family said that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed states that Clinton will remain loyal to the Netherlands as a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge if elected
The leader of democracies at the Senate, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that the democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton will be nominated by Judge Merric Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republics of the Senate blocked the Haland claim, and as President Barack Obama nominated it in March.
The leader of the majority group at the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next president will choose the person who will be able to replace the last Supreme Court judge, Antonine Skalia.
Reid said at the conference ring on Thursday that he was predicting Clinton's choosing a "with some degree of confidence."
A representative of Reid later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would come up with a Galand, and had simply built assumptions.
He praised Gharland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "squeak a boat" with a new choice.
The Garland is the principal judge of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Colombia.
Rid said that the Republicans who blocked the Glander's opposition were the "scrapers" and the "partners" of the Republican candidate for President Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't right for the job.
Treats states that the ethnic calendars for 'women as well as men'
The Traats magazine is working with photographer David Bellmer to release a calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli of the 1970s.
But instead of the naked celebrities, they are intended to find the next generation of top-models for their 2017 calendar, with the discovery of muses.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine, with a lot of naked models, is different from old-fashioned Playboy because Playboy is for men.
I make it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar is on it, too.
“We need to return to the demonstration of the eternal and classic naked figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,” said Shaw in a press release declaring a calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can present photos online or personally at open castes in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will give me a note about unfair Internet jigsaws.
They're going to release a monument in Moscow that will tell you how not to be a victim of an Internet company.
This was reported in Rosbabenor, M24.
It is reported that the authorities are preparing a monument that will help citizens choose the Internet bag correctly and identify potential fraudulent schemes.
The concept of the brochure includes several sections.
These would be general information and legislation, rules on the delivery of goods, ways of protecting their legitimate rights.
In the annex, recommendations will be made on how to draw up the claim, and so on,” mentioned in the Russia-Northernzore.
The note is being finalized to date.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the Roscobenor site in Moscow, and is also scheduled to issue a printed version and distribute a Moscow version.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia issued a statement in which it named the second suspect in the organization of a sabotage in Crimea.
Persons from Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Alexandrovich and Zachty Andrey Romanović.
"They all give confessions," says the communication.
An earlier resident of the Zaporian region, Evgeni Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, admitted his guilt for questioning.
The FAS will use Google for 438 million roubles.
The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on a 438 million roubles corporation on the agency's website.
“The Google fine for breaking antimonopoly legislation amounted to R$ 438 million.
We hope that the company will carry out our decision and pay the fine soon,” said Deputy Head FAS Alexei Docenko.
During the course of the investigation, FAS found that Google supplies smartphone manufacturers sold on Russian territory only on the condition that other applications of the corporation are installed on the device.
The annexes also include a search engine to be installed on the main screen of the smartphone.
The corporation is thus violating article 1, paragraph 1, of the FO “Protection of Competition” (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the enforcement of the order will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the Russian mobile software market, which will have a beneficial effect on our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act needs to be respected by all companies whose products are placed in Russian Federation and transnational corporations, including the Director of the Control of Communications and Information Technologies of the Russian Federation, Elena Zaeva.
It's suspected of a conspiracy of 16 Russian shops.
The New Booknet was fined for selling the book 50 Days Before My Suicide.
The network of New Bookstores is fined for selling Stace Kramer's "50 Days Before My Suicide" book, reports Moscow City News Agency.
The book may be seen as “envocating or motivating child and adolescent behaviour” without specifying the value of the fine in Rosbabudsor.
The OST confirmed that there had been a violation of the requirements for distribution among children of information products and decided to impose a fine of 49 copies of the print products arrested by the Roscobenor Authority.
The source in The New Book confirmed that it was Stace Kramer's work.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookshops in Moscow were screened for a “50 days prior to my suicide”.
There will be a memorial night in Moscow for Ernest the Unknown.
There will be a memory party in Moscow by the sculptor Ernest Unknown, reporting to the TTSS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central Letters House.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown One in the United States personally.
Therefore, it was decided to make this evening for those who wanted to mention it on their native land,” declared the Russian Congress press service.
It noted that this was important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
The evening is attended by close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Eugenius Eutushenko, artist Boris Messerer, President of the GMI, Puskin Irina Antonova, director of the Russian culture, Vladimir Medinski, head of the Moscow Department of Culture, Alexander Kibowsky, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pharmacist.
It has been reported earlier that Ernest Unknown's relatives are planning to conduct the Paniid in Skulptor in New York until 14 August.
The end-user was vindictive: who actually buys the plates?
Middle-aged single men love vinyl.
And until you let go of the section of the comments by the rude insults under the pseudonymous NeGsyindizymnomy, the allegation comes from factual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the reviving of the plate is due, not to the generation-by-generation boom of two thousand who want to infiltrate a new material object, but to nostalgia for the middle years.
Those who have just bought a vinyl album with a high proportion of probability are between 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are least likely.
It's also not just the act of gathering lovers -- it's an emotional thing: older buyers blamed themselves slightly more likely (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would have followed me while I was walking in the middle of a busy street of Soho, in a modest grey suit and poignantly gestureing before the stop, folding my hands and saying something inspiring like, "Yes, let's see."
All right, let's see.
While Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm and dirt — hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops have now filled up buildings, once run by independent salesmen — several music shops with fantastic experts have yet to remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these shops, and I'm trying to estimate their age and emotional mood by observing.
Glasgow Stuart's 55-year-old student, who I followed from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Recklingless Records (data count: eight men in the middle, one woman probably above 20 years), in London for half-day, and walking around shops to take hours.
He's a collector, I'm asking?
"I suppose so," he said.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates are shown above (he sent me a picture of me by e-mail, I did not follow him home) along the walls of his living room.
Its reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles is partly derived from his available income: he can now buy plates that he could not afford when he left, and buy the items he sold when he was young and had small.
"Many of the things I buy are the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12, the things for which I was probably too young to buy," he said.
He agrees that those who buy them are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
It's my fault.
Welles, 25-year-old Easter Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets correspond to YouGov's profile.
He noted, however, a new wave of media - driven people who heard about their return and felt the responsibility to buy out their old plates.
According to the conversations I had, the people were able to get rid of their collection, usually in about 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their own wine to buy a CD-ROM are now selling their CDs to buy out their plates," he says.
This could explain the boom among the renaissance figures at a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the plates?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that plastic shops offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Weza, some of the older clients, in particular, are offended by the valueless pay system.
Some have been guilty of the shock of the digital world, preferring to permanently remove familiar envelopes for plastics, objects that perpetuate the memories of a silent youth.
“I think that sometimes it may be the filling of empty or material things as a sort of calm,” says Wees.
Since I'm the collector myself, I've got it, and I think many people have it, too.
It's just a way to take your head off.
"We are like their social workers!" said a colleague from the glass plate.
The ICM survey in April showed that nearly 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent had no winner, while 7 per cent had no recordr.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably have looked seriously puzzled, smoldering ceilings with Bosanowa's collectors.
A "Tremendous" aspect of recovery is what Johnny, 42 years old, has been working in the Sounds of the University (data count: three middle-year men).
"Someone has come recently and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy Radiohead's plate so that we can put it in the regiment,' he says.
It's not a lot of interest, but it's definitely going to happen.
More than a piece, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older, just a little bit less than twenty who just get to know it.
Fop, who's now taking away almost the entire floor of the vinyl, a much more diverse audience when I'm here.
There are couples in their 70 ’ s who are photographing, teenage boys and women in their mid-aged years.
Although the atmosphere is less unnecessary than in the above-mentioned shops, the last Sint and Sex Post Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, is being tried through columns, it is a pleasure to see diversity in its customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but a painful psychological trauma is hard to figure out 30 seconds next to someone else.
Eleanor, aged 27, went through the Fup for a few minutes, looking at the various plates available on the market.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
It doesn't earn much, she says, so it doesn't make a very suitable way of collecting plates.
It's worth it.
Listening to music on a computer or another device -- just but the beauty of the vinyl is..." -- it's absorbed into a dream with an breath full of love.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop is the store, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of fans: urban fashion.
While I'm creating an illusion that I'm looking at a pair of genie pebbles, I'm watching a group of teenage girls, each minute going around a Polaroid camera, before my father and his daughter start to discuss the purchase of a Crusley player.
On the left is a ladder with plates of Adel, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winhouse, and Flitted Mac: a mixture of modern styles and classics, mandatory plates for any medium collection.
No one is watching — perhaps because they are just ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "finish guilt."
But given that any attention to these objects can mean more money to the industry and send several clients to Soho depths for a while, little more to complain about.
It is no wonder that a population that is more likely than most have more time and money than most are to spend most of their money on luxury items, such as wine.
But in the meantime, my findings indicate that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho plate shops, they do not exclude the large number of women collectors and wine lovers who are in reality in plastic shops and online forums.
These people are probably all working in schools or offices.
But they obviously don't spend the morning of Thursday by walking around the plate shops on Bervik Street, the lazier plate and avoiding the opinions of a unpleasant 30-year-old false leader hanging over the shoulders of no unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland polar shark — the longest - lived vertebrae — is a video report
Scientists say that the Greenlandic polar shark has the largest life expectancy on the planet.
Giulius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, claims that her record was 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
The French court rejects the proposal to withdraw shops in the Jungli refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer by the Kale authorities to demolish dozens of homemade shops and restaurants at the Jungli camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At this week ' s court hearings, the Kale authorities said that the State should be able to cut down a total of 72 home-made shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to jump or sell tea for 50 cents (40r) or commutable food for several euros at home-made restaurants.
The Kale Prefecture was said to be uprooted because they were a parallel economy that did not pay taxes and because they were dangerous to fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian teams have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, stating that free dishes offered by the advocacy association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing population in the camp.
They said that homeowners and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court held that there was no legitimate reason to expel people who run 72 home-made shops, but stated that the problems of the Kale prefecture were “well understood”.
Judge Jean-Franzua Molla said that the bachelorlies, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people who "live in extremely bad conditions."
He said that space had provided calm points of meeting with refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition was the Jungle Children's Cafe of the Camp, which works for no benefit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French sessions and counselling on the provision of asylum for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escort in the camp.

Britain stops on silver in RlV-7 after Fiji's master class allows them to take gold.
Britain's impressive series in Rebie 7 was rocked by a final obstacle to Fiji's final team on Thursday night, when they were totally destroyed in Deodoro stadium here in Rio.
Fiji provided a ball master, dethroning, gardening, game support, line running and heavy force to win gold, its first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat did not come with the least-poor peace of silver, the third in Britain in a day, and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tour of Rebie 7, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated on their way.
The painful beating of Boks, 7-5 in a semi-final earlier day, could be returned to adversely affect them at the end.
But regardless of what happens, Fiji has won this kind of victory as much as it can be for a team of 15 people.
This may be some comfort to the British — but it is probably not — that at least one British will hang on the neck of the golden medal tomorrow: Chief Coach of Fiji - Ben Ryan, former English chief of Wimbledon.
It was a journey for the British.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on the Adlaidad Seaves.
They've lost only one here.
These strokes will cause pain, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji began a great game of showing off British attempts to grab a ball.
It was like hitting a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the championships of the World Series went up to 5-0 when Osea Kalinnisau dived into the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Gerryr Tuvai added another tapdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The brilliant attempt by Mitchell to intercept the man-in-law of Leon Nakarv kept the man-in-law from killing the third, but it only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jas Weremalaoa took a tachdaun in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Carava added another one after the resumption, and there was still more minutes... in the first half.
Vathemo Ravaux then broke through a number of more intrusive attempts to intercept the British and stormed the line to get the eye.
Implementation led to a interruption of 29-0.
It looks as if Fiji was born to play the thresh 7 game, while Britain is still mastering the trade.
Which is to a large extent so.
Great Britain made massive substitutes for half of the game, and they bought a Fiji cause... for all four minutes, which was good for the first half until Joshua Tuisov went through a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton seized an attempt for the British, made a tachdown in the left corner to make an account of 36-7, but the game had long since been on the road of South Sea Islanders, who had their ashes fans, to wave their flags and dances at the rostrums.
The Fijian approach was not to be admired.
Mother William graced a Fijian cake that did not need to be adorned, another attempt in the last seconds.
A whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on a lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan 20 to 5 in its semi-final, and Britain had a little bypassed South Africa in a hard half-final attempt by everyone — the difference in Britain’s realization.
Kyle Brown takes Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some wonderful work, broke the line and hit the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to interrogate from Marcus Watson, Brother 15 towards the team of England, Anthony, won the victory -- and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Staning are inspired to win the dam fight with cancer
There won't be more exciting gold in these games, and it's talking about something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy peaks in history, Helen Glover and Heather Staning found additional value of their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who were hanging, in this boat there were three votes, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always looking for the second contract of Olympian gold in women's pairs, the first women in British sports to get to that height.
Their superiority was absolute, at the end of the day, it was their 39th inconsolable speech, again unprecedented.
What we see is, two brilliant athletes who slip through the surface with the elegance of the swan do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Each gold dam of a ready-made battalion that promotes progressive victory, which is important, does not have hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, when diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had urine bubble cancer, which is one of the things they can operate, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could have been quite a bad situation.
She's a bit of a change in your species for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was fortunate that he could start treatment in early 2014 in the inter-season area, while maintaining a gap in the schedule, if this could be the right expression in circumstances such as this.
I needed payment, so I had to go quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked in the hospital — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they were talking quite a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The Greeble itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bit more.
The next moment after victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nerve morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own feelings.
Staning, the captain of the artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind his shoulders, said, "I was the emotional breakdown this week, maybe it's a little too much, but that means so much."
It only confirms how much that means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin too.
It was fantastic for three years with Helen and Robyn.
Without Robin, we would not be, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Staning did not lose any race in five years.
This couple set a tense rhythm that their competitors could never meet.
Even the last 500 metres, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Staning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very much in the phase.
Helen calls out, "Remain in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We didn't wait for the fireworks tonight, but we just waited for a good Greeks to come out and win this race that we did.
It takes a couple a year to figure out their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, her own TV distortion on Steve Beckhall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
It would mean too much pressure.
It took London about six months to realize that I had become the Olympic championship.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government has extended the destruction date of the sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the destruction of food prohibited for entry into Russia.
The order was signed by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the prohibition was repeatedly granted, and is in force until 31 December 2017.
Some imports of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein are prohibited to Russia.
In particular, meat and meat, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and milk products have been banned.
Food disposal by embargoes into the country has been taking place in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016, about 100 tons of prohibited products were seized from the sale.

Rain and storms are expected to rain in Moscow on Friday.
Through the capital region, the atmospheric front will pass, bringing rainfall and lower air temperatures.
The air is warmed to 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C].
Thus, on Saturday night, there will be short-term rains in Moscow, potential storms and windstorms of up to 15 m/s.
The rainy day is expected to be between 12 and 17 m/s.
The storms are also projected in Orlovsky, Kursky and Voronzeezi districts, reports "Dani.ru".
Next week, rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO arbitrators ' panel found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rates are higher than the commitments made by the Russian Federation upon accession to WTO.
“This is the first time WTO has decided against the Russian Federation”, states the communication on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators emphasized in their opinion that the Europeans did not provide sufficient evidence to show that the Russian Federation's measures were “systematic” or “extremely comprehensive”.
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt the import duties to paper and refrigerators soon.
This is described in a report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to appeal to the World Trade Organization for the actions of Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is referred to in a statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May, Financial Times wrote that U.S. behaviour in resolving disputes in WTO undermines the organization's discussion principles.
Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members made a similar statement, owing to the American refusal to approve, for a second term, the South Korean Judge Chan Song Hwa.
Therefore, Russia will not address the WTO on Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now includes 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The president's office was replaced by a leader.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, appointed the head of his own administration as former Deputy Sergey Ivanovov Vaino.
Vladimir Putin conducted a re-establishment in the administration of the President and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Weino stated during the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that had begun as head of the administration of President Ivanov and promised to cooperate with the Government.
In the past, Izvestiya had written that experts considered the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the position of head of administration as transparent and understandable and repositioning would not in principle alter the work of the Kremlin Administration.
They note that the leader who had served the President for a long time has left his office and has effectively built up the work of the AP.
Instead, the Deputy Head of Administration, Anton Waino, was a man who knew the specifics of the work well.
In Poland, they admit they won't buy fuel from Gasprom.
The State Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years, the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become attractive to it because of a shift to fuel from Norway and other countries.
The Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Bojislaw Majac, reported on this.
His words are delivered to the TTSS.
"May be we're not going to buy gas at all," we're diversifying our supplies.
In the next four years, the main supply areas for us will be East, CNG terminals raw materials and Norway,” said Marzec.
Gazprom is now dominated by the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had delivered almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, 30 per cent higher than 2015.
The proportion of Russian gas giants in PGNIG procurement increased to 49.8 per cent, compared with 40 per cent earlier.
We recall that on 22 July, the Polish Antimonopoly Department did not agree on the establishment of a joint Gazproma company and its European partners in the construction of the "Northern Flow-2" gas pipeline.
Poland, however, had previously left a Gazproma request for 11 billion cubic metres of gas for the North Flow-2.
The vice-chairman, Alexander Medvedev, said that.
A auction for North Flow-2 will take place in 2017 and in autumn 2016 it will be auctioned.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action on the Polish side's intentions to abandon long-term gas contracts from Russia since 2022, and declared the Vice-President of the Government of Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that, in the first quarter of this year, Poles only increased 42 per cent of the amount of gas purchased from the Russian Federation.
Gazproma's request added that the very fact that the Polish PGNIG applied to the Stockholm Arbitration Court did not mean that negotiations were terminated.
The Polish company had previously appealed to the court to obtain a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
Remember, the Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure Peter Naimski reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the Gazprom contract for gas supply.
The Polish contract with Gasprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Petr Naimski, stated that his country could refuse to supply blue fuel from east after six years.
He said that Warsaw planned to build a new liquid natural gas terminal for Baltic Pipe, which would link the country to the Norwegian shelf.
“Several flow-2” includes the construction of two streams of a sea pipeline of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the seabed of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the Ukrainian border with Crimean.
This was reported by Alexander Hug, the first co-chair of the AMM in Ukraine.
"I can confirm that the AMM has increased the number of observers in this field," he said, responding to the relevant question of journalists, passing over the RA News.
According to OSCE, there are no security incidents at the border of Ukraine and Crimea.
Observers monitored the events at the three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainen border.
A video of the Kaka-42 passenger aircraft landing at Ufa Airport appeared on the Network, flying over the runway of 400 metres and falling to the left wing.
Video recording published '360.
The RP occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
Krasavi's flight came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported in a parking position.
Ufa's airport is running in normal mode.
The Forced Investigation Department of SCR transport investigated the causes of the heavy landing of a liner.
The UN investigates the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistura, believes that it was incontrovertible.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of the inter-Syria talks, to be launched at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have initiated investigations into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on a toxic gas attack, suspected to be chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that in an area on the eve of the previous day the Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down by aircraft, but that in Moscow the charges had been called a discharge.
The Russian Ministry of Defence later accused the opposition group Harakat Nur Al-Din al-Znica of having occurred.
Soon it was known that the toxic gas bombs were two.
That was confirmed by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, it started to smell, it became difficult to breathe," the observer quoted.
The attack resulted in at least 7 deaths and 23 hospitalizations.
If the use of the poisoning gas was confirmed by the experts, action would be considered a war crime.
The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told journalists, "The evidence that this actually happened is abundant."
The non-use of chlorine for military purposes is prescribed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Although all sides of the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 use of chlorine by the Syrian army against “a moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo complicates the daily shelling of its areas, while terrorists obstruct the removal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations is waiting for Russia to establish a humanitarian pause in hostilities.
The current regime of the three-hour silence in the organization is considered to be “not sufficient to help the nearly 2 million civilians trapped in the trap”.
Staffan de Mistura Humanitarian Adviser Jan Egeland stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required each week to bring relief and evacuation from the sick and wounded.
“We have to send heavy cargo from a convoy of trucks to an area where roads are practically destroyed and those remaining are mined”, Mr. Egeland said.
Consultations in Geneva between the United States and Russia on the establishment of a humanitarian pause continue.
As Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
With the ongoing fighting for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, on 11 August, announced the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will be in effect on a daily basis starting on Thursday.
The creation of a humanitarian window is designed to ensure that medicines, food and basic necessities are delivered to the city.
The decision of the Minoboron of the Russian Federation was taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow to withdraw the military operation and facilitate the resumption of the negotiating process.
A series of explosions in Thailand’s resort killed four people.
Immediately, several explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed, 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions came to the town of Hua-Hin.
There were 10 foreign nationals, four of whom were Russian.
No terrorist group had yet taken responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs had rushed to state that Islamists were not involved in it.
Several people have already been arrested on suspicion of causing explosions.
Preliminary figures from the local police indicate that the scope and characteristics of the explosions were directed against the military leaders of the country.
It took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong beach in the Phuket area and Hua-Hin, Trung and Surat-Tani.
Following the arrival of the military Hutu in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already been visited, 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects to prepare and organize the attack have already been detained, and the Colonel of the police force, Christian Patanacharoen, reported.
He added, but in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, “are sure that they are not associated with international extremist groups”.
It's too early to draw conclusions, said Mr. Patanacharoen.
But we know exactly that these incidents are not directly related to any type of terrorism, in fact, they are local sabotages, and we are trying to identify those who are behind them.
The blast took place on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai Hutu considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to police General Sichicha Srispaçarogenrat, the bombs were bombed at a distance of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with restaurants by tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead is a Thai girl who sold out a street meal.
The identity of the other victims is not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them four Germans, three Dutchs, two Italians and an Austrian.
Russia is not a victim of the bombing, reported to the Russian press service.
Local experts also linked the explosions to the referendum held on 7 August, in which 61.4 per cent of the country ' s population supported the draft new constitution.
He was being prepared by a constitutional commission appointed by a military bully.
The voting had to be determined whether they supported a system in which the highest House of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
We recall that on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the Commander of the army of Prauta Chan-Och.
This step, he said, led the army to an ongoing political crisis and to the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military have set up a National Peace and Order Council, introduced curfews and censorship, dispersed the protestors and the upper House of Parliament.
How Bangkok came to be in a state of emergency
The Government of Thailand, headed by Prime Minister Yinglock Chinawat, announced in January 2014 a state of emergency in Bangkok and adjacent to the capital of the provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred at the victory monument in Bangkok, where 28 people were affected, five of them in critical condition.
The explosions took place on motorcycles unknown.
The authorities increased security measures in the capital and engaged the military to protect the demonstrators.
The development of conditions in Suk Lung has begun.
As has been known, the Government has been asked to agree on the draft conditions for the auction on the gold field of Suja Long, while maintaining two key restrictions.
It is proposed that a company where 25 per cent or more belongs to foreigners and those with no minimum of 25 per cent of the capital participation be prevented from being subject to the auction.
The industry does not expect the Government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players are not risking a difficult and expensive project.
The auction could be announced in August, and the auction could be held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources introduced into the Government a draft auction order and conditions at Russia's largest undeveloped gold field site (Sukha Log (Irkutsk Region, stock and resources - 130 million ounces) and described two sources of “dare” familiar with the situation.
The draft was introduced on Wednesday evening, one of which was clarified.
At the Ministry of Environment, the project was confirmed to the Government.
The representative of the curator of the non-remote Vice-Prime Minister, Alexander Baronin, said "Dear", that the project had not yet been put in the office of the project official.
“The auction may be announced as early as August, immediately after the Government's decision has been issued, and given the time limit for the gathering of applications by potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender may be held in October”, the Ministry of Nature speaks.
As indicated by the report, there were two key requirements for potential participants in the option, which was sent to harmonize the ministries and the FOVI in July (to date).
One is the existence of at least 25 per cent of the total number of representatives in the claimant ' s capital.
The second is denial of access to auction for companies under foreign investor control, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investment in strategic societies.
According to the two draft articles listed in the draft articles, as already written on August 2, the auction may prevent companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent and above) are neither tax residents of the Russian Federation nor dual nationals.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions as the Suha Long is a federal subsoil (over 50 tons of gold).
In the Ministry of Natural Resources, the project “holds restrictions on the admission of foreign companies” but refused to comment on the details prior to the Government's order.
The demand for government participation in the auctions raised the Irkutsk Region, referred to the Ministry of Nature in December 2015 and confirmed later the Governor of the region of Sergei Levchenko, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor, Sergei Erozenko, “investigated on investment projects with the Rostrich”.
Any person who lobbyed for a restriction on the admission of aliens, the interlocutors are “no” to be specified.
“But it's in the spirit of time: not to give control to Russia's largest gold field in the background of the western sanctions,” says the interviewer, who is familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Sergey Donsky, on 1 August, stated that foreigners “may go into a consortium” if the claimants attract them “as financial agents, technological partners”.
The "one" interlocutors believe it's unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The industry's main claimant in Sujua Loga is considered to be the consortium of the largest gold miner PAH PAH "Polis", son of Sulayman Karimov Said, and "Rosteh".
As I said, in July, partners set up SL Gold, where Polo has 51% of shares, RT-GP is 49%.
In the Rustrich, no comments were made, the Polus stated, “Observously”, that the asset was “interested” and had all the competences and resources necessary for its development.
“But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the conditions have been announced”, added to Police.
FRASO may participate in the auction, but the decision for the Government of the Russian Federation has been heard by sources of “Observe”.
The Russian GV Gold and Canada's Kinross developing assets in Chukotka provided an opportunity to participate in the development of the Dry Loga, while Polimatal and North were not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of Gold Manufacturers of the Russian Federation, Sergey Kashuba, in December 2015, estimated the “early” investment in Suha Lung in $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants were afraid not only of the volume of investments but also of the complexity of the project: there was a need for a serious supply and technology of complex ore management, which was explained by the interlocutors in the industry.
In the pension market, the largest M&A-KIT Finance Pension Administrator has initiated the consolidation process of four NPF-controlled companies.
As a result, a NPF of approximately 373 billion roubles will be established using the Gasfund Pension Savings.
The commencement of procedures for the consolidation of four pension funds, namely, KIT Finance, PromagroFund, Inheritance and Gasfund Pension Savings, yesterday notified the owner of the KIT OF Funds to the Pension Administrator.
“The reorganization shall be carried out in agreement with the CB, subject to the requirement of non-dangerous terms of the contracts in force”, states the company's report.
The integration is based on the Gasfund Pension Savings.
According to the director of the NPF, Oleg Biashyski, the pool of funds has several objectives: greater geography of presence, concentration of resources for development, reduced costs, replicating the best practices of each fund and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the deadline for the completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the combination of the Gasfund Pension Savings, the NPF will become the largest player in the SPS market.
As at 31 March, the pooled funds had accumulated pension savings exceeding 373 billion roubles.
According to the reports on the funds' web site, the beneficiaries of their owner, the “Finance Pension Administrator” CTI, are now Anatoly Gavrilenko (through the OO controlled, owns 65 per cent) and the Gasfund NPF (35 per cent).
However, the group itself started to compete much later.
Thus, the O1-controlled "Buying" NPF has swallowed "StalFund" early this year.
The joint NPF now joins the Uralsib and Russyb funds.
“In addition to reducing costs, integration is necessary to address structural challenges”, notes the NPF Gender of Nicholas Sidorov’s Future.
The Safmar-NPF “European”, “Education and Science” and “RegionFond” are also active in the Safmar pension group, the European PPF, and the Regional Fund, must enter the Safmar NPF before the end of the year.
The NPF Trust will join them in 2017.
“The pooling of funds will have the effect of increasing control over risks, processes and expenditures”, noted in the Saffer pension group.
The delay in the pooling of funds that the Financial Administrator of the Pension Board has withdrawn may be due to several factors, and the experts shall indicate.
Until recently, NPFs could not buy more than 40 per cent of the group ' s current infrastructure bonds.
Following amendments to the CB Regulation in March this year for a number of issuers meeting the regulator ' s requirements, these restrictions are no longer applicable.
"If necessary, a major player can buy out the entire output," says the director of the AKRA financial institution rating team, Yury Nogin.
Several NPF managers from top-15 on assets have another possible cause of a pause referred to the division of spheres of influence and, consequently, staff appointments in a single fund to be agreed between owners of the group.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment.
The Gazfund NPF also did not respond to the request.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and low-cost exercise, this long-range solution will be justified.
According to Sergey Okolasnov, a director of a consulting company, Sergei Okolesov, at the Gasfund Pension Savings lowers, accession will stabilize the foundation of other group funds.
This will take into account the more successful experience of the NPF, KITT Finance, and PromagroFund, in building retail sales for SPS, as well as the use of more modern RPs.
The CB requirements for NPF processes and personnel are constantly increasing, so that it is inappropriate to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, according to Paul Mitrofan, Managing Director of Corporate Ratings as “Expert RA”.
"An effect on the reduction of duplicative functions will clearly overlap the possible costs of association," Mr. Mitrofan said.
The cost of pooling four Sergey Okolesov funds is estimated to be between 30 and 50 million roubles.
“The cost of maintaining four such funds is about 400 million roubles per year, with the consolidation of the medium-term budget to be reduced by twice,” Mr. Okolesnov is confident.
A good dysnuic film called "Pit and His Dragon" came into the Russian tunnel.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the artisan dragon, the soul-skilling story and song in the canal style are enough to believe once again in old - fashioned magic.
A frightened little girl approved a dragon that became a human child, a gentle baby baby baby, and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliott, after a pup in a storybook, playing with him in the dormitory and falling asleep in the air.
Six years later, when he was thrown down and won, he was no longer distinguished from another imperishable forest sorganist, the Mugli.
In this form of Pete, a red-headed female hero Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard) finds her husband, while the Guinean Brigade (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively losing the forest.
Now she'll have to believe in a dragon, but she'll have to help save him.
Pete is taking an accelerated course of “to be human” in an Idillian American environment that wears cowboy shirts, a moral code in the heart and smiles blindly than any ad.
No character looks or acts too terrible for the spectator to really start to hate him or to fear him.
Even Gavin, who discovered the hunting of the untapped forest inhabitants of his forests, is far from being a unjust villain.
A huge bush dragon was also made with no fear at all, with a good seadod of bulls, a flight liner’s wing, and the ability to become invisible.
It's funny, it's glamorous, and it's even snooping, and fortunately doesn't say, but it's always trying to stroke, and it's very different from all the famous film-making dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of keeping up with such a high degree of emotional involvement that, in the most tense moments, the three arms begin to cry desperately, not only for the small audience, but also for the adults.
The amazingly good and young Oaks Figli as Pete, which is a gap between a possible family and a true friend.
And Robert Redford scoops out a canonical grandfather who's happy to have literally every baby.
How did President David Louri manage to take off the fantasticly cute reed of a 1977 dysfunction movie Dracon Pita, directly from his nose to the tip of his tail, remembered only by a wizard and a game movie, and make it the most emotional movie this summer?
Not unless the miracle helped.
In his painting, Louri, from the original, actually took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There were music numbers behind the boat, and most of the weird jokes.
This good story reads the drawings from Bamby, the Foreigner, and many other sweet hearts of children's paintings.
Discei continues to make a successful expansion of the 21st century’s high-quality renegotiators gallery.
Of course, Pete and the dragon are not as brilliant as the "Jungley Book", and there is no masterful villain that Kate Blancshette is in the role of a stepmother in the new "Study."
But this naive film is also successful in helping to believe in the wonders and good of the best dysnus ’ traditions.
By the way, the keys to a magic castle, Disney director Lowry, will get another, for the art filming of Peter Pene.
"Pete and his dragon" with "David Lowry" and scriptor Toby Halbrux entered a new ambitious project about a non-mature boy in the same story of James Barry.
Journalist RBC Alexander Sokolov is charged with new charges
Counsels of the journalist RBC Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist entity, stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had been misinformed in the case of their defender.
That the Public Prosecutor's Office made this presentation, we learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in a court hearing on the question of the limitation of the knowledge of the criminal case, but the proceedings were not held and the investigators told us of the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office,” cited by the BBC as Olga Dinse's lawyer.
She explained that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated to the investigators that the case was not compatible with the case and the material collected.
The investigators will now have to clear the gaps in the evidence base and bring new charges against Alexander Sokolov.
Either there will be another article of the Criminal Code (C Code) or it will remain the same, with other arguments and new evidence, as Mrs. Dinzie explains.
As reported by the report, Alexander Soklov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation had excluded the phrase of “the political climate towards instability” and “the refusal of power by illegal means” from the charge of the BBC journalist.
ALEXANDR ZILBERT, a member of Commmersboscoport, lived an Olympic in the Olympic village, inspected the Russian assembly house, lunched in the local dining room, and even passed the WADA test after that.
I don't think life here lasts for a second.
Even at night.
The last ones sometimes finish at midnight, after which athletes need an hour and a half to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, the village is being settled and evicted, as some athletes are closing their speeches and leaving Brazil and some are only arriving here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations are being held in one of the temporary tenants.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic questions, and we tell the head of the Russian Olympic team, Igor Kazikov.
It's a hot water problem, so I'm sorry, with the toilets.
We had a long struggle for cleanliness.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the Kliners came in, but they just put some stuff on the floor, and that's it.
Pauls, do you see any innovation?
You can't wash them humanly.
We know that regiment, the laminate is common!
Anyway, we've got a change in the clinical company, and now it's all OK.
The Olympic village is a South Botuvo, a dormitory area fenced on one side of the mountains, on the other side of the mountain, on an impressive roar, on a well of water.
And for the sake of reliability, there's still a two-metre railway fence across the perimeter, which is a two-metre railway fence.
A total of up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses can be located in the village.
In one of the 18-story buildings, a huge Russian flag hangs -- this house is completely devoted to the needs of our assembly.
By looking at the small flicker at the entrance, you can immediately determine which problems seem to be the most urgent for the domestic team.
There are two announcements on the registration desk: the print paper "Please don't leave paper to the toilet!" and the hand "Acquiescence to badges.
The desk itself drowns in tracts.
Their cheerful flower contrasts with the headlines of the brochures: “An Infectious Diseases in Rio de Janeiro”, “First Aid to Utilizing, borne by Foreign Body in the Refrigeracy, lost consciousness, phases of heart and lungs”, “First Aid to Fire, Warming, Breaking, and Hemorrhaging”.
The text inside is a very encouraging one.
For example: “infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent healing.
However, not all are expected to have a favourable outcome.
Of course, there is a medical centre in Russia's assembled location, which is ready to provide qualified assistance at any time, including a relaxing and sporting massage.
On the other hand, it is the headquarters of our delegation that is the medical centre.
Near the door is a inspiring poster, "No matter what, we'll win!"
And, of course, poems:
All the arguments are absolute bullshit!
Only those who are afraid believe in them.
Let less of us than the sweetest taste of victory; let Russia not retreat nor break.
And for even more spirit, the announcement is, "Dear brothers and sisters!
Following the blessing of the Most Holy patriarch of Moscow and the whole of Russie Kirilla, the spiritual care of the athletes of Russia’s Olympic Congress is carried out by the protoires of Andrey Vladimirrovich Alexev.
You can order molben and other demands by telephone...
In general, the village has a Centre for Meditation and Religious Worships for All Religions.
And Russian, in a privileged position, they've got their own hours.
Because of the elevator load from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the ladder, which is recommended to be used during the fire.
And in the dark, there was a foothold of the bodies on it.
It seems that these were the staff members of the new clinical company.
I suppose they decided to spend a quiet time on cold steps at any moment in order to wash themselves off of innovative genders.
On the fourth floor, I was expecting a meeting with some of my old acquaintances -- Vitali Fedorich Dubko, the trainer of our fighters, who brought them to the Olympic gold another 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his mother - in - law, Jan Paul’s champion of Europe, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
It's not a big deal to complain about, the well-deserved trainer of Russia gives the impression.
Sanuzel's one on four, but he's wide.
Of course, it's funny, it's out of the cloth, it's not credible, but something can be done.
"No, you're pretending the tea is over!" -- she's handcuffing Svetlana Kuznetsov's tennis character, which I met in the main dining room.
Its main name is at least because it is space 2,700 square metres and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There are 60,000 servings out here 24 hours free of charge.
Menu options are as follows: "Breaker from Brazil", "Peacehouses", "Asia Foods" and "Pias, macarones".
The last version, I watched, is very popular with our volleyballists.
I didn't find any soup in any of the units at the giant restaurant.
I'm surprised.
It's a good thing I've taken with me a Chinese guy.
And the teapot.
But even so you understand, we have even worse food on our backs.
There's something you can choose here, despite all of this homogeneous uniformity.
I personally chose a steam track and a jadeball in a tomato sauce.
A three-language tablet with each dish is in English, French and Portuguese, as well as the food value of the product and the availability of allergens.
Well, that's right, you know, it was a treat.
I don't even know why such a turn is worth all the time in the local McDonald's.
Hardy, relaxed, you can say "tight" athletes out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The winner of the T - shirt is trapped in a pit - of - the - camera trap.
They're instigating, you can say!
To get a gift, we need to answer at least eight questions out of ten correctly.
I've got questions for the Russian, and I've been attacked by a WADA girl.
But I didn't.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic breakdown, of course.
The situation has become worse on the second question: "If I have received notification of the doping control, should I go to the doping control immediately?"
I came up with Option B, "No, I have an hour."
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot WADA doesn't have to wait.
Well, we have to show up immediately.
But at the seventh stage, my situation became very critical.
I thought, for some reason, that if I found it hard to keep a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and I'm hard to do), then I can use bio-invasives to get "additional nutrients" to increase my productivity."
No, you can't!
To be precise, the answer is so that it is not categorically prohibited, but strongly, in several proposals it is denied.
It's not fair playing this WADA!
What's up, Russia?
To go nowhere is behind Ephesus, Isinbaev, and our entire blooded team.
So I focused on this and won an unfortunate t-shirt out of my last effort.
Know ours, as it is!
In a winning mood, I got lost in the physical center of my neighborhood.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
I hit 250.
It was surprising to note that not a Russian athlete was found in this threat to the track.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let the one who doesn't know how to play exercise.
And here's one of our guys sitting in a nearby clinic.
It's the eye specialist's line.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In a polyclinic, as is the case in the whole village, where there's no spit, there's a condom system.
Thereupon, there is a strong cry: “Oamn with the horse.”
The only time left is to spin a doorknob with a hand, and a condom made of Amazonian natural latex is ready to fall out of the box.
I took myself alone, to memory.
The athletes were not to be won, and 450,000 of them were brought in.
There is a whole entertainment centre in the Olympic village, just for a holiday and holiday.
There is an educational tablet that reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is filled with video games, billboards and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange devices that look like video screeners.
I'm interested in a comrade in the form of a Ukrainian assembly board that actively uses a wild toy.
Of course, you could just say that you don't want to talk to a person in the form of Russia's collection, and that's it.
There's, by the way, something strange in the eyes of the little ones in the yellow blue.
It's the best game ever made, it's all over.
It takes at least three hours to reach every corner of the village.
But if it's walking, and not driving, you'll be opened up by a Canadian bench with elk at the entrance and a bathtub, a laundry office, a laundry, a dry cleaner, a barber shop, a flower shop, a store of everyday goods, and a mail with unique stamps (only you can't keep track of Chinese philatelics) and a bank, and an office of finds, and a photochiosc.
And late in the evening, Issilé, you will sit down near an olive tree that has been wrapped up in various flowering tapes to commemorate those who have left the world for friends and relatives of athletes.
And you're going to be under the accompaniment of a machine that defies the fluid to kill insects, to think of forever.
I mean the Olympic movement.
The one in this village doesn't stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was breathing, Australians nearly ordered American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know that the news that Inna Derriglyzov won the gold on the XXXI Olympic Games was the first time I got.
Maybe I'm the only Musczych who saw it happen, not to think of those who were watching the Carioca competition that night, of course.
It can only mean a real fan.
Consider this: a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbours on the bottom -- as always by the time of night -- wake up and start unloving, but cry out very loudly at each other.
And it's threatening to move the furniture.
There's no time to go to the market in the kitchen and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
The TV schedule doesn't understand anything, so it's just to keep a grip on the Talk, the First, and in just one case, the Mission, although it's almost meaningless.
"Rosesia" is a family of repetitives, the whole sport there for some reason in the recording.
There's live TV series.
Hope, of course, for "Mach," a whole night a young man shouted in news shows first about the great half-Final of Derigazza-Shanaev, then about the coming battle for gold.
It'd be logical to show you.
But instead basketball -- USA -- Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half ever won.
Put the Americans at the scene of their own greatness.
As a result, the basketball Olympic tournament is still lost, but it is now being expressed that it will not be the same.
That's all right, but the fight against Dee Franciski is coming, and there's no change on the screen.
In the light panic, I start to mail channels.
That's the feeling, the second time in a row, it's cool.
All right, go deep, go to the cables.
There is no fencing on any of the subject "Matches".
And I feel that the fight is about to begin.
Text and Twitter broadcasts of some sports sites don't make me happy.
The Ship Surfing gives a unexpected but brilliant result.
The first site shows that all competitions taking place at this point in time are being directly broadcast.
Calling fencing, getting a gold match.
Trees are great counterattacks, they go forwards, and obviously they start running out of time.
It's almost the entire gap in Italy.
Our one point ahead, just over two seconds.
De Franchisca throws himself on Derriglyz, and retreats, time is over, Italians take the shot.
It's a victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic phoners report a fourth gold medal.
Turns out I'm the first person to see it with my eyes.
The foolish, the faithful, the involved.
The spiritual administration of Muslims (MOUs) of Tatars refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM plenary ordered its imams to preach Fridays only on Tatars to make young Tatars "to learn their mother tongue."
In the Administration, it is stated that this “neither in any case harms” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some Kazani mosques, it is reported that the Tatar language does not speak up to 60 per cent of the people, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
The imams fear that their Tatar sermons "will not reach the entire audience."
Yesterday, the plenary of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic in the Tatar language only.
As Muftstan Kamil Samillin stated, this should be an incentive for young Tartars to learn their mother tongue.
"To those who say that it's heavy, in every big mosque, we intend to organize lessons in the Tatar language completely free of charge," promised Mr. Samirlyn.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and today, in all mosques, the sermon must “be already in the Tatar language”.
He recalled that the Tatar DUM published the magazine Sheura with typical Tatar sermons.
Imam, who doesn't speak the Tartars enough, "may be thoroughly prepared."
The Tatar DAM brings together more than a thousand visitors to all municipalities.
According to Moufia, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, the Russian language was used mainly in a number of mosques in Kazan.
In particular, as Mufti pointed out, this was practiced at the Burnav Mosque, Zakaban and the Eniller.
However, Mr. Muhametsin stressed that the leadership is intended to ensure that all students speak the two national languages, regardless of nationality.
"It is not possible to talk about the abuse of non-attack Muslims," said Mr. Muhametsin, explaining that the sermon itself “is not compulsory, the main part of the namaz.”
At the same time, the oil itself will continue to be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will continue to be taught in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said, "I saw", that there was no serious threat of the transfer of Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages such as Uzbek or Tajik, according to his information, are not used in the sermons in the Republic.
The DAM decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WTT).
The head of the Bottle VC Reenat Zakirov said, "The creatures are an important part of our national life."
It would be unfortunate if the Tatar language had gone from this sphere.
He noted that preaching is in the Tatar language alone, “the will of the Imams themselves”, but in the VT in question,“that is the right thing to do”.
The Imams interviewed, who were preaching in Russian, are ready to implement the decision of DUM, but believe that the people who are here will have difficulty understanding the clergy.
Both the Tatars and the Russians go to the mosque.
Many don't understand the language.
Of course they will.
"I have to get stuck," says Imam of the Burnav Mosque, Farhat Mavletdinov.
He said that preaching in Russian was closer even to many Tatars, since "rusan and in schools, and in kindergartens, on the radio, at first."
He believed, however, that the mosque would be able to continue its classes and lectures in Russian on other days.
We trust in Allah.
He will show you the way out of this situation,' he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not speak Tatar.
They are Uzbeks, Tajiks, Azerbaijanis.
Foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we went into Russian four years," he says to them.
He believes that in Tatar, the sermon will be “to reach a narrower circle and not reach the entire audience”.
But we will submit to the decision of the plenary.
It's just that the preaching work will be different.
But time will tell.
"I'm only, for example, easier because Tatar is my native tongue," concluded Gabdul Galillin.
A former director of the FSIN has been put to trial
The Prosecutor's Office of Moscow has approved an indictment in the criminal case of theft of the budget allocated to Russia's FSIN.
Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused more than 2.7 billion rouble damage, will be brought to trial.
The capital prosecutor sent criminal proceedings against the former director of Russian FSIN, Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy Nikolai Krivapova, as well as the Director of the GCO, the Center for Information Technology and Liaison of the Federal Enforcement of Penalties (CITOS) Víctor Odaninov.
Depending on the role and degree of involvement in the commission of crimes, they are accused by the SCRU under article 3, paragraph 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure (injured use of official powers resulting in serious consequences), article 4, article 159 of the Criminal Code (in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Cripovov is charged under article 1 of article 222 of the Criminal Code (unlawful acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CCR, in 2010-2012, the individuals were fraudulently abducted from the State treasury of the budget allocated by the FSIN to provide agencies with electronic monitoring systems for the control of the so-called electronics.
In order to steal budgetary money, the team developed a scheme according to which the CITOS-controlled company with which the relevant government contracts had been concluded had produced technical controls and supervision, including “electronics” and had implemented several times at prices overstated.
Despite the lack of productive equipment, facilities and facilities by the CITEF to establish a complete cycle of e-balls production, five subcontracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles have been concluded between it and the Russian FSIN.
This scheme resulted in over 2 billion roubles in the accounts of the Samoan branch of the PGP, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
As a consequence, over 140 million cash deposits were received in person by Mr. Reimer, in his office, from a accomplice whose criminal case had been assigned to separate proceedings.
Nicholas Cripapova, who was involved in the frauds, found unknown ammunition for a gun, which allowed him to be charged further.
In the present case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim for damages of 2.7 billion roubles.
Soukur's pilot Hakan Shukur is suspected of being involved in the road.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then a member of the Parliament of Hakan Shukur and searched his family ' s two homes.
From the beginning of the 2000s, attacker Hakan Schukur is being sought out by the national authorities for an attempted coup d'état last month.
Forvard, who finished his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to a “armed terrorist faction”.
This is the Hashette movement, a society connected with the well-known Turkish religious figure and the oppositioner Fechullah Gülen.
It is his President Erdogan who co-hosts an attempt at a military coup on 15 July.
Fechullah Gülen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities require his extradition.
According to local media reports, today a warrant was issued for the arrest of Hakan Shukur, and the police have already conducted searches in two homes owned by a former football family.
According to the evidence, his father was also involved in the organization of Fethhulha Gülen, except Hakan Shukur himself.
However, neither the former football player nor his family were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
In the past, the football player Hakan Schukur protected the colors of several Turkish clubs and spoke in favour of a assembled country.
He spent most of his career at Galatasarai.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".
True, none of them had more than one season.
Hakan Shukur is still the most effective attacker of Turkey, with 112 matches for his national team and 51 shot balls.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his deputy office because of the corruption of the Erdogan party and its immediate environment.
According to the Turkish newspaper Herriyt, on 25 July, arrest warrants were issued in Turkey for at least 42 journalists.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and of associating with the opposition Islamic preacher Fechullah Gülen, who lives in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, the media can wait for long prison terms, ranging from 10 years to several life sentences.
Herr Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would create a network of cinemas only for Russian films, which cost two or three times less than for films of foreign production," he said.
Mr. Konchalovski notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for the viewer with large Hollywood tapes.
We have more than 100 paintings a year in our country, of which an average of 20-25 tapes reach the screens.
"And even they have a very hard time competing with the Transformers and the Iron Man, who's running huge budgets," the filmmaker said.
Remember, on 1 July, the All-Russia Youth Education Forum “Tavrida” opened its work in Crimeu.
Among the participants are teachers in creative professions and young professionals in various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and from a number of countries of neighbouring and long-range foreign countries.

A.A. News - The new gene contractor promises to surrender Zenit Arena by 26 December.
A new gender engineer based in St. Petersburg, the stadium, to be hosted by the Cup of Confederacy 2017 and the World Cup of 2018, Métrostre, promises to rent by 26 December, reports REA News, referring to the chapter of the Provisional Commission of the Council of the Federation for the Preparation of the World Cup for the Trench Cup 2018 Vadim Tulpanov.
“We went to the construction with the Minister of Sports of Russia, Vitalimo Mutko, and we had a director of the Metrostroya Vadim Alexanders.
He said he'd hand over the stadium by 26 December.
It's a serious Petersburg company, it's never breaking the time limit.
"We, Vitaly Mutko and I are happy to see and hear," quotes the interlocutor agency.
Vitaly Mutko had previously arrived in St. Petersburg to examine the venue for upcoming large-scale competitions.
Mr. Tulipov also noted that his Sovfeda Commission would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and to attend the construction regularly.
It will be recalled, yesterday, that Metrostre will complete Zenit Arena, a contract worth about 5.4 billion roubles, and the same company won a bid for the improvement of the Territory around the stadium, a contract cost of 2.4 billion roubles.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.
For details on the selection of a new gene contractor, read the "Drop" version of "Metrostra" in the field.
In Miassa, Chile, a lawyer from the former Vice Governor, Nikolai Sandakova Constantine Akuli.
As reported by the OCED-Ural, another lawyer for the accused, Sergey Kolossowski, was summoned to the investigation department today by Constantine Akulić to charge a one-year record of beatings in the case.
Constantine Akulic then went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to assist one of his participants.
"It was originally brought against unidentified persons, and now, when he began to protect Nikolai Sandakova, it turned out to be Akulic," Sergey Kolossowski said.
Constantine Akulich became a lawyer for an ex-assist governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before a lawyer was summoned to the R.C.R., the defence was informed that Monday would be due to read the fraud case in which Nikolai Sandakova was accused.
Remember, two criminal cases have been initiated against Nikolai Sandakova.
As part of the first (fraud case), he was given the responsibility of contributing to the appointment of the head of the administration of Lake Eugion Tarasov as mayor.
The second criminal case relates to the bribe allegedly received by Igor Kalugin, Director of Pito, Nikolay Sandakov, in the amount of at least 1.3 million roubles illicitly from PLOP.
For details on Mr. Sandakova's case, read in the "Drop" paper, "The former Vice Governor needs to merge his case."
The Russian Honey Company (MCP) is prepared to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the modernization of one of the oldest and environmental “pollutant” enterprises in the country of the Karabash Media Synergy.
The Karabasa media plant was founded by an English shareholder society headed by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
In Soviet times, this was an industrial business that was relevant to the country ' s economy, and it effectively ensured the functioning of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production had been stopped, resulting in serious social problems in Karabash.
A decision was taken in 1998 to resume the Karabash mediate.
There was also a need to address one of the main problems of the Karabash environmental plant.
By the beginning of the 2000s, Karabash had already been notoriously known as a zone of environmental disaster.
The situation in Karabasmeda began to change in 2004, after the business had moved under the authority of the Russian Honey Company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually reduced environmental pressures.
This has recently been noted by the Governor of Chelabin province, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabassmedi in the first few days of July.
The head of South Urala described the tremendous changes that had taken place with the enterprise since the Karabasmedi moved into the RCM group.
The main modernization activity of Karabasmeda in recent years has been the construction of a new Sernosol chain to capture up to 99.9% of the metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Media Company, the total investment in the project was about 7 billion roubles.
The next phase of the improvement of the Karabasmedi UO is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of the three converters, the stickers, the gas tract is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is .5 billion roubles.
In addition, it is planned to launch a new industrial waste treatment facility at the end of 2016 at a cost of 1 billion roubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes allocated to the town of Karabash will increase.
In the course of the Tomin HOC project, from the beginning of construction to the second stage, the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
And once GOC is put into service, the flow of taxes into budgets at all levels can amount to 80.9 billion roubles.
During the year of production in the Varnán district, the budgets at different levels have listed 346.3 million roubles.
And that's in the first year.
"The longer a business works successfully, the more retention payments may be," added Valery Ulanovsky.
In the CCF, it was clarified that in 2015 the tax deductions from Micaev GOC reached 1 billion roubles.
However, the participation of CCM enterprises in the life and development of the territories is not limited to tax deductions.
RCM facilities help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and entertainment facilities, and improve the Territory.
In 2016, a major social project of the Russian Honey Company in Karabasa was major rehabilitation and, in fact, the almost complete restructuring of the N9 kindergarten for 95 inmates.
The building built in 1960 was in emergency condition.
There will also be a landscape park with artificial ponds, underground and ground parks for 600 cars, cafes and sports stores.
The Aena MCPC will allow for the holding of spectacular professional sporting events at the international level.
But the main objective of the project is to make physical education and sports comfortable for the people of Chelabinsk, especially children.

Sandholm refugee staff in Denmark suspected that the adolescents living there were engaging in prostitution.
On Thursday, 11 August, The Local reports.
He said that some teenagers told the agency that “someone in Copenhagen was organizing prostitution”.
According to the publication, doubts about the shelter were raised after the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan told of similar stories in Malmah.
In 2015, the crisis in Europe arose as a result of the influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
Denmark has placed over 20,000 of them on its territory.
On the peninsula of Cape Cod, U.S.A., the fishermen caught a rare blue lobster.
The man found cancerous among the other submarines, reported ABC News.
The American is planning to take it to the local ocean system.
Lobster weighs about a kilo.
It is noted that Wayne Nicerson has been fishing frontals for the past 35 years.

WSJ: The US is considering imposing sanctions against the FM because of the break-in of democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the break-in of the Democratic Party servers, writing The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, it is reported that Barack Obama's administration will have to formally charge an attack on the Russian server or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other United States intelligence services are practically confident of Russian involvement in cyberattack.
WSJ notes that the U.S. generally prefers not to identify those who carry on hacker attacks.
The exception is Sony Entertainment Pictures database, which was officially held by the DPRK in 2014.
In the past year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the sanctions imposed on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could be used against other countries as well.
The sanctions process may be lengthy, writing a publication.
Even if officials have concluded that hackers acted with Russian support, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose.
They will have to determine whether an accident is so serious as to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that Barack Obama's administration allowed sanctions against the State whose hackers had broken down the Nazi Democratic Party's servers.
The WikiLeaks Web site published an electronic correspondence of the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the hackers.
In Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google by almost half a billion roubles
Competition in the mobile applications market was an issue.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated at the Jadex initiative.
The Russian company claimed that Google provided smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the installation of applications from other developers, in particular the Yandeks.
The FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant position on the market and imposed the installation with Google Play of other applications on mobile manufacturers.
Following an audit, the Federal Antimonopophobic Service decided to punish Google by reporting to the deputy head of FAS Alexey Docenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
In FAS, all companies, including transnational corporations, should comply with the competition protection law.
In turn, Google intends to study the solution first and only then determine how to proceed with it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopophobic Service found the company to be in violation of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered that the contracts be adjusted by 18 December.
However, there was no agreement at Google.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting judicial proceedings.
FAS noted that despite the fine, the possibility of a world agreement was discussed with Google.
The measure will not lead to anything.
The leading analyst, Mobile Research Group Eldar Murtazin, expressed this view.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would have no effect on the users or on the competitiveness of the corporation.

Sneapchat’s “Anime” effect is criticized as a cartoon on Asians
Snapchat states that this filter is inspired by an animist, but some commentators say it's racially impolite.
The Snapchat tool allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and to play with the individual ways that are beyond absurd.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog, or a character to match Roy Liechtenstein's painting.
Lynches are thick, warp features of tools that create over 30 million adjusted salts a day.
Any mistakes quickly become public knowledge.
The Snaapchat lenses were exposed to criticism in the past when they were accused of being advertised a dark skin of a person or of encouraging outcasts as an ideal of beauty.
So when some of the users this week offered a lens that gave them white eyes, curved teeth, and fluffy cheeks, some critics found it a racist cartoon on Asians, yellowheads.
And they wondered whether these recurrent contradictions pointed to the more serious diversity problem of the company.
Reports on The Verge and Mobileboard were distributed on Wednesday, the day after the Sneapchat claimed that they had removed the function.
The company commented: the lisa was designed to be an amony to the characters, not a cartoon to the Asians.
But experts who know about racism in the first place recalled offensive stereotypes in action.
Others totally rejected the comparison with anim.
In an electronic letter, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student of art whose tweet about photographs was actively shared, said that lisa was “injured and at least awkward”.
She added that “it was difficult to argue against the comparison of the very rough cartoon on the Asian side and the filter effects.
This shows that the filter is, not just yellow, but extremely degrading.
Snapchat is not the only company passing through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the deweces that we all carry with us.
And a huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean that they are more likely to expect understanding.
When one of the Snapchats is creating an image that is offensive to the user, then in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Cathy Jo, it's much harder to stay unnoticed as it used to be.
On Thursday, Joo, the Products and Engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In a media article and in a telephone interview, she said that she felt that racial contradictions were the reason for the lack of diversity in recruitment in Snapchat.
The company's white leadership, male-only, was mostly criticized and finished its article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
According to Joo, who himself is a Chinese American, “either they have not had enough white people to make such decisions, or they have white people, but do not occupy positions in which they can speak safely and openly.”
Other observers shared her view by expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat had not answered most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but according to the attorney, the company recently hired a Recruit to concentrate on underrepresented segments of the population and to actively attempt to attract domestic resources.
For her part, Jo said that she would keep her account of the Sneapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say it won't work."
Military leadership distorted ISIS intelligence, reported to Congress Commission
The officials of the U.S. Central Command revised the intelligence records to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground gave rise to, and reported to the Congress Commission on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Republican Chairs of the Committee of Representatives for the VC, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Allocation Subcommittee found “wide-ranging resentment” among the analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service, who claim that the leaders had submitted their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military authority in Tampa, Florida, which controls United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Investigative documents approved by Centcom's higher command generally gave a more optimistic picture of the anti-terrorism action of the United States than the actual evidence from the scene, and were steadily more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special services,” said a news release dedicated to the report.
“What took place in Centcom is unacceptable: when the senior management appears to be indisputable analysis, our military are suffering,” said a member of the House of Representatives Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Management problems in Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report provides details of the persistent shortcomings that occurred in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by Central Command.
Although he does not provide definitive evidence that Obama's administration had been ordered to falsify the reports, he claims that the analysts felt that the Centcom's leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony by the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than actual events,” the report reported.
For example, Centcom officials publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it's known for sure," said a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest leadership of the United States Central Command Intelligence Command falsified intelligence documents to minimize the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans established an operational group when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that the intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the account published on Thursday will be expanded.
The Director General of the Ministry of Defence conducts an additional, incomplete investigation of the Centcoma intelligence.
The representatives of the democratic party in the Intelligence Committee of the US Congress House published their own data on Thursday, which are consistent with some of the conclusions of the republican operational group.
“To each and every 2014 and 2015 Centcom established an excessively closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments concerning ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces,” claims in a statement by the member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, the chief representative of the democratic party in the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, “has stopped the production of intelligence documents”, damaged the moral condition of analysts and “is not sufficiently representative of the distraught views”.
But Schiff and the democracies claim that they found no evidence that the White House tried to force Centcoma analysts to push their opinions on “sent or political interpretation”.
Preliminary findings of the Congress investigations were presented on Tuesday to the Port of The Daily Beast.
Last August The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by Chief Inspector Pentagon, opened after the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, stated in the statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress report while the Chief Inspector was continuing his investigation.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree in the interpretation of integrated data, and special services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics of national security”.
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether American bombing in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence now claims) has reached the goal.
But last year's statements have raised doubts as to whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Criticism of intelligence intelligence on the Islamic State repeats a dispute that took place more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hoocker wrote a research article claiming that President George Walker Bush's administration had advocated a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think of what would follow 2003 invasion.
Hucker has also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence inside the Islamic State.
In the past year, officials said that Hukera ' s team had concluded that, despite public allegations to the contrary, oil spillers belonging to the Islamic State had not caused a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not made available outside the Central Command, as The Times reported in September.
The then commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Ostin III, was criticized last year after testimony at the Senate, which many deputies considered to be overly optimistic about war.
General Ostin resigned in April and was replaced by the Central Command, Gen. Joseph L. Wittel.
U.S. wins four consecutive times in the women's hockey in the grass, thus approaching a critical match with Britain.
Killing once three heads in a match that won Japan with an account of 6-1, Cathy Bahm opened an account on Thursday the first two heads of the U.S. women's hockey team in the grass when Americans won over the India team with an account of 3-0.
Five heads in two games should be a lasting achievement, but Bam, who is 27, says she wouldn't be sure if she would have done something like that once.
"I won't put it in," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who's been tracking their heads.
That's what she knows: Americans account 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains unconquerable after the losing of Japan with an account of 2-0 on Thursday.
The British and United States teams will meet on Saturday on the last tour game.
Both teams pretend to be fourth, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid meeting a great team of Dutch rivals, the leaders of another group, a little weather when the four-year-olds start playing.
However, Saturday’s game shows that Americans here have made their surprise series noise four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams on the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time she took a hockey button on grass, when she was 3 (her twin sisters played this sport in Drekel), and joined the 16-year-old national team, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she didn't pass a selection tour to the finals.
Then came 2012 when things went wrong with her and her teammates.
The following year Koeig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed trainer, and it was beginning to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical education change," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the kind of productivity we have right now.
We've completely changed our mind.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of a broth game with a uncomfortable hand for a short distance.
India had approached the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team had shown itself to be surprisingly rigid and had maintained an account of 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bam took the initiative.
She made a long passage with a ball down on the left side of the field, and then the spiral went into the middle and sharply sent the ball into the gate, giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa González added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The drying win was the first one for the U.S. altar of Jackie Briggs to miss one head in each of the first three winners.
She's in shock.
So did Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how much better does it depend on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Through the confusion of the Olympic Games - Dang race racers on the Batututah
Wherever you are, whatever the time it is, it's the Olympics.
Developments in Rio de Janeiro seem constant and inevitable, a raging combination of competitions and aspirations.
It's like the Olympic fire itself, and it's the burning torch that's coming from the archer to the pipe, to the hymnast, to the triatlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors' conversation in the cafe, and you can't hear about Simon Bails, Cathy Ledeki, or about the hostility between Michael Pheps and Chad de Clo.
There's also Logan Dooley.
Dulley, for the first time participating in the Olympic Games, a pretty plumbing on the cheek, could well be one of the great figures shown in the Proms promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials if he were a finger, a gymnasm, or even a fetomist.
But a 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forrest in California is fighting for gold in the Olympic contests at the Battuette.
The Olympic fire does not cover all events in the same way.
Further away from the centre, partially in the shadows, are sports that are not universally recognized: fire from a pneumatic gun, bowminton, techkwondo.
Brass will always be with us, for his long reign.
But if I am allowed to speak up to protect my personal passions, let me draw your attention to the modest charms of a bathtub.
Although the Bottuate jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at a game in Sydney, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many people I interviewed have not been aware of that they are generally a Olympic sport.
This could be regional ignorance.
While the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won the medals on the Battut, and their athletes did not go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian generally share male awards, while Chinese and Canadian share female awards.
Dun Dun of China and Rouz McLennan of Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But Battuth jumps have an autsaider balloon, particularly because the uneducated ear is more associated with the circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here, I must admit that I am not an expert, but just a ground-based enthusiast.
They do have a comical potential — the cartoon milling of unending jumps — but also the leaching of gymnastics and jumps into water, the two sports that they usually combine.
The word "bout" comes from the Spanish word "el transpirann" meaning "promplin for jumps into water."
The contestants jump on the giant Battute, taking almost 30 feet into the air, and are required to perform a series of acrobattic tricks (turns, bends, and lotto) to the final landing on their feet.
They are assessed for their performance, complexity and time of flight, according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The most widely distributed Olympic course is on the move.
Protesters must go farther, faster, higher, and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, to and fro in the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the start-up wall, but also, in view of the TV camera, another point of view: the world’s or the Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, commendable, even fanatical, and enough to make even the viewer climb.
But I think it's somewhat exhausting to watch the Games.
They give him a break on the Battuette.
Battutis are directed up.
Movement forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps up, seems like an astronaut flying up, then down, then without trying again up.
And, of course, there is no competition or difficulty in them, but throughout the programme there is no foolish zeal for the finish, no leaps in the length of, just the strange, impressive disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest Olympic sport to the day.
Women's qualification competitions and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast on the day of Eastern Europe; men's on Saturday, also on the hour.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the daily programme from 2 pm to 2 pm.
In the midst of the Olympic conflict, a calm, beautiful moment is expected to be seen in the common dump.
And if the increase in consciousness can be achieved only by giving male athletes the proper views and objectivity — as the Wall Street Journal has recently suggested by United States men — the Dooley is waiting for his new excited band of fans.
"A Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a long-standing U.S. ally
Rising protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators that require political change in Ethiopia faced a violent confrontation by the Government.
Eyewitnesses say that dozens of protestors were fatally wounded during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of division?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a firm ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months anti-government protests have shocked the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets, demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s reaction was harsh.
Witnesses claimed that dozens of unarmed demonstrators had been shot by police officers.
Videos taken from protests at the end of the past or earlier this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Official for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It has been difficult everywhere to keep this country from breaking down, and it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is developing at an impressive speed.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — even a new suburban train in the capital city of Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, has hardly been a model of democracy — human rights organizations have consistently mentioned the government opposition in the territory of the State, and have been silenced by the fact that dissidents are in fact silenced.
Many of them have been exiled, imprisoned, killed or expelled into remote deserts.
But it can change.
“If people are constantly suppressed and left no alternative but to protest, the rebellion will rise,” said Seyum Teshome, lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
There's a generation protesting.
Many complaints, ranging from land use to the takeover of power by the Government coalition.
Following the widely criticized elections last year, the Government party and its allies completely outstriped the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, the tension along the Eritrea border is growing; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
The analysts fear that separatist groups that have been destroyed more or less in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to use disturbances and re-armed.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings of a number of years of boiling deep within the soul are now flashing.
The first, it seems, is completely harmless: smartphones.
In just the last couple of years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become common and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government has closed access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate through the proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that that's how they organized them to protest.
Second, there is greater solidarity between Oromo and Amhar, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara of Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands has flourished in politics and business by operating Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in low-lying areas.
But it also changes.
"We shall work together at one beginning," said Mulata Hemech, leader of Oromo.
Major protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that the Tigray ethnic group in Ethiopia has an unfair dominance of about 6 per cent of the population, which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
A third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who might have anticipated danger.
Analysts claim that he particularly experienced the initial signs of discontent and used spies to obtain data and decontamination of opponents.
"The new regime lacks common sense," Abdi said, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Heilemarim Desalel, came nowhere and occupied Melesa.
Unlike Melesa, who came from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam southerne.
The analysts say he doesn't have the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that this will lead to further bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia experienced such disturbances in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said seemed to be elections which the Government had stopped and then falsified.
Many Protestants have been killed during the repressions, although in fewer numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest has been relatively rapid.
Development experts expressed their appreciation to Ethiopia ' s leaders for the long-term development of infrastructure, such as the new long-term train and significant achievements in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growing internal frustration of the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month the protestors in Gondara, the city in Amhar, attacked Tigray-owned enterprises, and the anti-Tygrian hatred of social networks becomes comprehensive.
The analysts state that the United States and other Western Allies are making the situation uncomfortable.
The American Government had used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently declared that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it was clear that the West wanted to support democracy, but on the other hand, he did not want his ally to lose strength in a already volatile region.
'And on this stiff rope it'll be difficult to get through,' said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, a "cancel."
Donald J. Trump tried to replace the last conflict that covered his pre-election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when, on several occasions this week, he claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of a terrorist group by the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican party's presidential candidate to make wise use of the American people.
It also put his alternates, who tried to protect him during a period of unrest, into a awkward situation, because they had to explain what he probably did not mean.
With this assumption on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in Twitter the morning of Friday, Trump wrote that he was just faking.
This was the exact opposite of the allegation made just the day before, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When Radio Conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump to soften his remarks, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, a Republican party presidential candidate did not take the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when Trump tried to shift his campaign to the economy in the face of a decline in ratings.
Trump and Clinton came up with competing things about the Michigan economy this week.
On Friday, Trump tried again to get back to the subject.
Once again, he came to Twitter, and he warned him that Clinton's plans would lead to tax increases, and he said that he had huddled up her speech boring.
The Trump used to be an excuse for sarcastics.
At the end of July, after he came across a general criticism, almost saying that the Russians should break down Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his remarks, and said, "Of course, I'm kidding."
This approach enables Trump to go beyond the political option and to take his or her words back if necessary.
“I think it's his way of testing messages that are received from his worshipers to see how they work and then to ‘explain ’ them in one way or the other, depending on his reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who conducted an analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he's careful about his comments and knows that they're vague enough to treat them differently.
Instead of softening the speech for a broad electorate, Trump has taken an even brighter tone in recent days, while its rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump is giving Clinton a big weight in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and with her going to Florida.
Although Trump generally tries not to apologize for the provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and of not understanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has been the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have made his loyal allies uncomfortable: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his comments are.
Rudolph W. Juliana, former Mayor of New York, one of the most famous deputy Trumps, made serious efforts to protect the candidate in the interview given by CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Juliana when asked about the veracity of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It's true that before Obama ISIS was almost unknown to a tiny organization, he called it a non-hazardous threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened because he brought the troops out of Iraq.
Most medium-sized republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, has allowed ISIS to break free, as it has not been able to settle the situation hard in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania rally on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for the embittering of each of his words and prejudiced against him.
He used to mock the poor poor TV experts who tried to crack it up, and he said, "It's weak."
Some democracies ridiculed Trump's excuses as a further proof that he was not fit for presidents.
Once exhausted coffee comes back to Greenpont.
"Verbie" was a well-covered, cash-only place in Williamsburg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but served a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room with a glass on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Shery's Magazine, which took up Verb during the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in a modern city.
"New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is being updated.
The reborn Verb coffee was opened in November last year at Greenpont, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Vaber has Wi-Fi taking credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and similar simple atmospheres.
Besides, coffee is still good.
The new "Verka" is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of an old caffeine, who owns and manages the general manager in the new location.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new location, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, aged 36, left much behind.
"Verb" works with the same biga conductor and bought the same coffee model.
There's even old "Verb" hatches in it.
But Rodriguez said that he would also like to experiment.
He's offered new dishes.
The menu presents sandwiches with bacon, eggs and cheese, and includes cappers or roasted bows.
There's brown-fed dishes.
The beer is no longer served in the coffee shop, but fresh, high - fat juices are now being prepared.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had drawn attention to the steady flow of old permanent clients.
"Many former clients have also been priced from Williamsburg," he said.
In one recent resurrection, Rebecca Oliveira was one of such clients.
Olivier, 34 years old, had lived in Williamsburg before, and had often visited Vber.
Even after she moved to Greenpint, she's still on her way there.
After the closing of "Verb", she said she had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere had immunized me in Verb," she said.
She's been drinking coffee again now, although on that day instead of the usual i.e., she ordered a bought tea, another one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, made a loyal visit to Vreb since 2003.
He went in front of his job and ordered the same.
"At fifteen minutes of eight, every day, like hours, I came in, and for me I had my pancake with butter and all the stuff," he said.
Rodriguez reported that he wanted to experiment and introduce new dishes into the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes a regular order, but at some point he's changing things by using a bacon, an egg, or cheese on a bike with all the stuff.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended that the soap store had once taken over the old place.
Moreover, Soup Cherie's owners have been invited to make a special soap for Verb using coffee from coffee prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree to their offer," said Rodriguez.
Permanent residents of the country of Polish origin also loved the coffee.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the wine shop so that his new neighbors would feel wanted.
There are other benefits to the new location.
A local marketer for juices plans to spill some bottles and sell some cold - prepared coffee.
It is likely that the coffee can be attached to a nearby building.
For many clients, it's enough that a new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client and said he was killed by grief when they closed.
When a cup of coffee opened in a new location, Whitt said that after entering and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
"How long have I wanted to feel this smell," he confessed.
Depressed depression food in the Vegetable.
In March 1933, shortly after rising to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat to lunch in the Oval Cabinet.
As a guruman, President Roosevelt loved fashionable fifth Avenue dishes, such as the Faua-gra and the meridland turtle soup.
His menus were smaller on that day, such as the front eggs in tomato sauce, the potato pureas, and the dessert in blacks.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Cough, added, "This was also a message for Americans to eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in the history of food.
The last book of Koua, "Ragu in Chinese", was devoted to Chinese kitchen in the Americas, and Ziegelman told the story of life in a winter apartment in Lower East Side through a meal in his home book, House 97 on the Street of the Fruit Garden.
Their new collaborative work of the Iron Path, which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
Having shown some of their own cooking solidarity, they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sunday, a tiny, simple-skin, Fletteyron Quarter, which has been working since 1929, the Birzewk.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a olive cheese and a olive piece sandwich, and Koo, 57, took an turkey, a potato pureas, and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered the meat roulette, the couple considered it an appropriate starting point for discussion about the food in the Depression era.
"The rounders used a lot of demand," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut roulette, liver roulette, beet roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to be spread out.
Imagine eating as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Who's flickering?
"He must have been lying in a stomach rock," he said.
In the years before depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
A group of women prepared for men farmers, and a fresh-time pie pressed for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I that described the country's reality that suddenly ceased to be a nation of wealth.
"It was the time when the food became a central, difficult topic for Americans," said Koo, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The same was true of the new budget system: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and bakeries, became essential foods; bakery was a “pretty way of disposing of the edifices, ” says Ziegelman, because the cook could hide non-appetite ingredients under a dense layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying.
Meat, which has long been the basis of American food, has been economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
In researching a book that includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared an age - baked onion made with peanut oil.
"This addition to the lunch table has not been successful," said Koe.
Ziegelman added, "That was very weird."
Araach oil is completely out of touch with a baked bow.
This was evident in many household prescriptions.
More than ever since then, home experts — including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal House Office, from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country’s food habits.
When they published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budgeters”, to accept the challenge and to transform the burdo of such protypttes with carrots into delicious dishes.
The Golden Path is a flattery of curious historical facts.
Especially pictorial are stories about the Government's reaction to starving citizens, such as the position of President Herbert Hoover in the spirit of “eating pies”.
Probingly to the simple Iowa farm rod of his childhood, he was feeding as a sophisticated millionaire to whom he had become.
"He liked a continental kitchen, like a hot sauce fish," Koe said.
He ate practically in a gilded dining-room with a tuxedo.
He was fantastically out of reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set an example for himself.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economics that was completely uninterested in taste, which led to the White House using not only the most dysfunctional food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes and the most gruesomely prepared.
Many of the culinary adventures of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Ziegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
Spouses tell us that during the writing of the book, they better understand the food habits of the mother of Zigelman — that she could not throw food, such as food.
"She was seriously afraid of being careless about the food," said Coo.
Ziegelman recalls, "She poisoned people on a full-blown basis."
There was one nasty case of profile.
When the plates at Eisenberg's deserts, they took Koo and they took desserts to their homes, which was a draft dessert that President Roosevelt had ate for lunch.
"It's called a blacksmith muss," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a widely distributed reception, to give modest recipes broil names.
There were no plums that had been struck, only nuns, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to lay down a spoon in a soft, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisedly, it was good.
Kou twice asked for supplements.
He said to his wife, with the sound of the budget, "A few roubles of Greek nuts would not have been stopped here."
The arrest of persons on the mass Drac case at the Khovan cemetery extended until 14 November
The Presinnament Court had left until 14 November under arrest the members of the mass fight trial at the Khovan cemetery, granting a request for investigation.
There are 14 accused persons in the case.
Let us recall that on 14 May, several hundred Central Asians and the North Caucasus from the Khovan cemetery fought a mass battle with weapons that killed three people.
A former cemetery leader, Yuryu Chabuev, and a lawyer, co-founder of the Health Nation Association, Alexander Bocharnikov, is charged with organizing the murder.
The question of the second in 2016 index of pensions can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by the Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation, Olga Holditz, during a visit to the British region.
We have set out specific parameters to be more effective in reducing the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
The economists are now taking stock of the outcome of the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks,” quotes The Good People of the Interfax.
Commenting on the six-year-old pension scheme proposed by the head of the Strategic Development Centre, Alexei Kudrine, a vice-premier, reported that the topic was not addressed in the cabin.
At the end of July, it was noted that the Government had agreed on a position on the complete indexing of pension benefits in 2017.
Kamena and Grigorian have been in the finals of a small-calibre rifle shooting.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Cyril Grigorian have been in the final competition for gunfires from low-caliber rifles in the Olympics in Brazil.
According to TRIPS, Sergey Kamensky scored 629 points and won the first place, the new Olympic record.
Cyril Grigorian became the second, 620.9.
Eight of the best athletes have gone to the finals.
Kamensky is the world record in this discipline (633).
The Turkish oppositioner Fechulah Gulen requires an international investigation into the attempted coup d ' état in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d'état”, quotes Gulena as the French newspaper Le Munde.
Also, the Turkish opposition stated that “if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey”.
However, Gulen strongly denied involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court previously in absentia arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fechulah Gülen.
We recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15-16 July.
Glad Company will recover costs for legal services during the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
Leidad Science Inc is entitled to receive compensation for the costs of legal services that it incurred in relation to the claim for hepatitis - C patent with Merck & Co Inc., decided by the federal district judge.
In June, Glad was released from payment of $200 million in damages for the breach of two Merck’s drug-related patents to Glad, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including oath lies and other non-ethical acts.
In a court appearance on Thursday, a U.S. federal court judge, Beth Lebson Freeman, said that Glad was entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred in the dispute.
Merck's company is trying to catch Glad, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013 when Glad and Merck filed trial on each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work based on the Sophosbusier, an active drug ingredient of the company Glad.
U.S.-supported armed forces claim to have taken over full control of Manbage from the Islamic State
The U.S.-supported armed forces took full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last remaining fighters in the city of the Islamic State left, reported the group on Friday.
The Syrian democratic forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the departure of the remaining group of fighters who fled into the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the fighters and informed the Reuters agency, Charfan Darwish, of the Manbage Military Council Allied with SPL.
"The city is completely under our control now, but we're doing cleaning operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax
Hillary Clinton issued its 2015 tax declarations on Friday to show that a presidential candidate from a democratic party and her husband had $10.75 million of income and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent this year.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in performance fees, and the former Secretary of State declared an income of $3 million from a publisher of Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the Department of State.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released tax declarations in ten years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to establish a standard of financial transparency," said the adviser to the pre-election headquarters of Clinton Jennifer Palmiery.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and violating his past promises to declare his tax declarations.
This is a regular matter for candidates for U.S. Presidents to publish their tax declarations, although they do not require the law to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers described the verification of the State Tax Service as the reason for his refusal to declare his tax declarations.
"Your move," wrote the adviser at Twitter at the pre-election headquarters of Clinton Jan Sams, referring to a democratic party candidate's declaration.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trumpa to release them until the tests were completed.
Critic Trumpa, including a candidate for Presidents of the republican Party in 2012, Mitta Romney and other republicans, said that his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including Russia.
Clinton seized the matter and released an online video on Friday, which focused on prominent Republicans who persuaded Trump to publish his tax records.
She raised this question on Thursday during the Michigan economy.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception to the presidential candidate for decades: to declare his tax declarations," she said to the assembled.
Politico reported that Trump had paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business writer quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Fridays as likely to be on the table.
Federal tax rates were the subject of a dispute in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire, an investor named Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year will pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska State, Buffett, whose conglomerate Burkshire Hathaway is based on it, suggested that Trump meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said that he was also under IRS review, and that Trump was "fear" not from tax collection agencies, but from voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters issued tax declarations until 2007.
Klintons, who now live in Chapaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 Klinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fuel fund, and Clinton announced dividends and capital revenue of $109,000.

Pediatric and fireworks are increasing the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Tanzanian environmental fighters use a non-traditional way of preventing elephants from entering communities — condoms filled with potions of Chile.
The method turned out to be effective, and Honeyuide Foundation, which came into the mind a few years ago, along with the American Committee for Nature Protection, took on its promotion by teaching volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use non-violent, four-step steps to protect their homes and crops without causing harm to animals.
Many used to defend themselves.
On Friday, there will be World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal protection.
"From the time we've invented a set of tools ..., we're seeing a change in relations within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without causing harm to elephants," said the Executive Director of HenyGuide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps are to burn the torch in front of the breaking elephant and signal the horn.
If it can't be scared away, they throw away what they call a cloud of Chile.
The chili powder, mixed with the soil, is placed in a condom with a boy, and the end is tied, and only the fiitin remains outside.
When it is lit, the condom bursts into the grouchet, spraying small dust with powders in the air.
One dual is usually enough to turn the elephant aside.
The extreme measure is a launching device that shoots Roman candles into the air by producing a loud, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey since the coup attempt in July this year.
Such data were provided by the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mevult Chavushoglu, in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we called off 208 human resources diplomats to continue their work at the centre.
Of these, 32 people have not returned without objective reasons or explanations,” said the head of the Turkish foreign policy department.
Let us recall that a coup attempt was launched in July in Turkey.
The authorities officially declared that the coup had failed, as well as the detention of more than 6,000 people, including higher and middle war crimes.
As a result of an attempted coup, 290 people were killed by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Jewish director severely criticized the Berlin hotel for removing the Israeli phone code by means of the Arabic query, and reported the RT News channel
The French director of Jewish origin has set a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not appear on the Israeli phone code, while the officers refer to the Arabic clients' requests.
Claude Lanceman, author of the "Shaa Holocaust" documentary, expressed his outrage at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German FAZ media.
During her recent stay at the Lanceman Hotel, Israel sought out the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the States where a call could be made from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was expelled and destroyed?
He wrote the Lanceman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the issue on the hotel board.
The answer he received there, according to Lanceman, was "sucking him."
Claire of the hotel said this was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel network."
The reason behind that step was even greater anger on the part of the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel’s code be removed," said Lanceman, a hotel servant.
Israeli ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, in Germany, referred to the case of “a fearful disgrace, ” reports Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
That this happened in Germany and that's where the hotel network is even more embarrassing.
I don't need an explanation here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
There was a lot of impact on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that Keminski's hotel was simply "about" for alleged Arab clients.
“You would be ashamed, ” said another post, stating that the hotel on the famous street of Kurfurstendamm was located close to the synagogue.
The hotel itself rushed to dismiss any charges, calling the alleged "anxiety" and "indictment" to the Lanceman, reports the newspaper Der Spiegel.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel in the rapid recruitment list”, quotes the words of a representative of the Kempinski Hotel Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code was now added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian protestors
Students met the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protestors.
The riots began when police officers tried to force the students, resulting in rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in demonstrations to express their concern about the plans.
As proposed by the Governor of the State of São Paulo, Heraldo Alkmin, nearly 100 State secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some protestors were seen writing on the Graffiti walls against the interim Acting President, Michael Thamer.
This last protest was only a few days after the protestors went out to the streets to support President Dilma Rusef, who had been expelled, when the Senate voted for her impeachment.
The trade between Russia and Iran grew 71%, reporting the RT Businessport
With the lifting of the sanctions, the trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to Ambassador Lewan Jagarian of Russia in Iran.
As international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there was a growing interest on the part of Russian firms in the conduct of business in the country, said the Ambassador.
Russian companies are relaunching ties with Iran and new firms are ready to have access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” said Jagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent compared with the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
An increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machine equipment, ground vehicles and weapons,” the Ambassador said.
Jagarian also predicts that this year Russia will be visited by a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mainly to tourists, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, it was the first time that Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of visitors to Russia.
We can say with certainty that last year’s record of the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be beaten, ” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yez, where there are still monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
The State continues to employ the nute in the defence and industrial complex.
The excuse for dismissal was the "systematic failure" of the director's orders from the alien director of Almaz-Antey, "lost in work" and "lost trust".
Hennadiy Benderski was appointed NGO leader over the next three years.
Information about Nescorodov’s dismissal came only on Thursday night and did not create widespread media coverage.
How can we explain such silence in the context of the military’s extensive rearmament?
Most likely, the FM ' s management does not wish to disseminate any rumours or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This confirms once again that there are many problems in the defence and industry (OPC) and that the State is unwilling to draw attention to them from society.
Departure is certainly an important development in terms of industrial order.
The NGO Almaz is the main concern of a concern concern in the production of marine and ground-based air defence systems (RCCs).
Almas is currently working on the establishment of the Poliement-Retute and the after-treatment, which are planned for new corregates, frigates, esmists and cracker.
The founder of the Military Russia Dmitri Kornev portal is of the opinion that the dismissal of Neskorodova was due to the disruption of the project time.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of the "Morphya" began in 2007 and the entry was expected in 2013.
The "Poliment Red" is supposed to be the main air conditioning system on the latest Navy ships.
According to the information I receive, in a few years of testing, there has been no truly successful test.
The truth, as far as I can tell, is there is no clear fault of Almaz,” said Corneve.
The expert fears that a delay in the entry into service may also occur with the C-500 AAC.
The project development work has not yet been completed, but the first complex is expected to join the military during 2016.
The Minobanna believes that “work is planned and will be completed within the time frame”, although in 2014 the agency recognized problems with the development of the C-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodova, who directed Almaz, since 2011.
Cornev noted that project breaks could be both a cause and a reason for dismissal.
In his view, it has become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in the PPC and enterprise management plans.
The industry received long - term orders for tens of billions of roubles, and a large sum of money is known to love silence.
As a rule, the directors of the defence companies are leaving positions of their own choosing, a contract of agreement between the parties or being transferred to other jobs.
In the present case, the suspension took place in public, albeit without having received a warrant.
This suggests that the leader of the Almasa might have been a stucco and opposed the top-down "depositions."
It appears that with such conduct the State no longer intends to tolerate with such behaviour.
It will remove from the hands of the shareholders those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and fail to perform the tasks assigned to them.
At the same time, the management of the Russian Federation is trying to punish incoming authorities (majings at Zveda shipyard).
The President himself is paying more attention to sector issues.
Vladimir Putin is the head of the Military Industrial Commission and meets periodically on re-arms.
The Kremlin protects the management of PPCs by trying to hold a loyal board of directors who will comply with instructions received from above.
This is a far-reaching policy, but in the face of corruption and the lack of competition in the PPC, other instruments do not have a State.
The situation of defence is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of managers in the PPC, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking very successful steps to enhance the professionalism of the Russian forces.
Army personnel have acquired a new quality by joining the post of Minister of Defence, Sergey Shoigu.
It seems that the President has adopted the famous saying, "Preparing a world - prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the Helsinki Pact, which established the Moscow sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the biopolar system, it worked well.
The absence of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East proved to be proof.
The “conquests” ring in the cold war eventually led to the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the “civilized world”, there may be no calm space left.
Despite the general distress, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
Under such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the fleet and the army.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to promote national interests more effectively and to move on to the new frontiers of world politics.
Scotch Kallom Skinner runs along the finish straight, taking the British's bike gold
Scottish Kallom Skinner was on his way to the triumph of a male command spa at the Rio bicycle last night, thus protecting the British command trio from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow was the strongest man that his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly entered history in a final straight line to win the victory on New Zealand’s return team.
Britain claimed to win an unexpected victory four years ago when Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they had performed the modest sixths on the world's March championship in London, even though Hoy had since finished his career.
The issue between Beijing and London was replaced by an expert from a member of Jamie Stoff.
They did just as the Hinds showed up.
Hoya's exit has also created a void that Keen Emadi and Matt Krempton tried to fill.
The Skinner was a British trainer who saw a Scottish potential that had now been realized.
Hundes, Kenny, the champions of Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set an Olympic record, but the standards were surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hundes was exactly behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported him.
The shift in strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindez went on a greater transmission to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched as an invited BBC expert from his seat and caught the look of Skinner, Kenny and Hindez when they stepped on the pedestal.
Skinner, 23-year-old, from Glasgow, said, "That's a tree comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can and make a name for myself.
We made the Olympic record in the finals and won the championships of the world.
It was unbelievable.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012, together with Kenny and Hoy, Hindez admitted that he had deliberately fallen on a track after a failed start.
He later retracted the comment, and there was no way to appeal by British competitors.
There was no such issue this time in the greatest victory.
Hindez said, "I felt like in London with all those British flags on the podium."
We've all met like a team in the last three months.
We lost on so many world-named races that the Olympics were just amazing again.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of 10 race names in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress over the past five months, then the bikes are waiting for five more successful days.
With the form Kenny has shown, it's not beyond the opportunity to imagine how Hoya's feat was repeated by winning three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would allow us to see how Kenny, who was born on 23 March exactly 12 years younger than Hoya (this seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgreywa, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister), brings his count to six gold medals and one silver medal.
That would be like Hoya's.
The next time Kenny competes in a syringe, which starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old kid from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Command competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's a little lonely to win alone, honestly.
Hyndez said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must be a knight."
It was the only thing in the day that made medals, but it was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clance, Stephen Burke and Owen Doll are the fastest four-kilometre prosecution team race.
They punctuated at 3:51.943.
The world record established at the 2012 London gold winner is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be the focus.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday on the day before the qualification order, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In an appropriate women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Schand, Elinor Barker and Cathy Archie of Milan improved the world record by showing time of 4:13,260.
The British Command came to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take possession of the middle period of the Olympic Games and earn a lot of medals.
After in fact exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas, not the last, that of leaving the post of Technical Director, Shein Sutton, in April, because of the sexism and harassment charges, and the departures of large figures, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first night’s race on the bicycle, it seems that legendary now Britain’s fame in reaching its peak at the right time may be repeated again.
Future of the Portland Metallurgical Plant under threat due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Victorian Portland aluminium plant — as well as the hundreds of workers — is threatened by the fact that the power company that supplies the plant, according to one factory owner, is going to terminate the supply contract: all contracts are expected to be terminated.
This step is the result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to extend subsidies to support the factory.
The fixed subsidy expires in November for 20 years.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be threatened by the plant Alcoa in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — could be in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects as the steel mill consumes about 10 per cent of the total electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the steel plant at Point Henry, which closed the power plant in Eglsa last year.
Alcoa’s Portland Metallurgical Plant loses money and risks closing.
This was the result of thinking about the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, initially because of the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later because of the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrab Valley, reported that the other three owners were also expected to take steps to break the contract.
The company control share of the plant belongs to the joint short-term enterprise, Alcoa and Almina, and the Chinese company CITIC and Maureni Corp, Japan, owns a smaller share.
"The AGL company expects that the portland facility will continue to work, that is, the physical demand for electricity from the steel plant will not cease," she stated.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are the so-called “heated contracts” that were to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a period of 12 months of avoidance, so they will actually end in 2017.
“Consistently, AGL still expects these contracts to bring their share of income in the 2017 financial year,” the electricity company stated.
Whatever the potential impact on AGL ' s profits from the financial year 2018 is now limited to projections of a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of the contracts by $187 million in respect of “representing dissolutions”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect the ability of Alcoa to run a steel factory or to supply electricity to a steel plant”.
The American company stated that it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it still had to explain why it had terminated the contract.
The analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland steel plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Turning to analysts earlier this week, AGL Stephen Mickelsen, the head of service, said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually, while Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants were to withdraw from the market, a significant reduction in demand for [electronic energy] would occur.
It would be bad for us as a producer, ” he said.
Not just the reality show, Kendall, on the cover of September's Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter of the Klan Kardashian-Jenner of the mother manager Chris, appeared on the lead cover of September in the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of Este Lawer's brand and defiled on fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my favorite people, I looked at this cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The news of the cover was accompanied by strange (or just in the spirit of the Kardashian family) prepared by reality videos, in which the whole family of Kardashyan-Jenner (debosshirs Rob and Caitlin, who also joined them with the world's favorite show business uncle, the producer of the Kardashian family, Ryan Sikrest, forgot to be a sister on the cover and, at the end, a classic turn, they planned a surprise party.
It's a standard storyline of almost all the episodes of children's TV shows dedicated to birthday.
Because with this episode, dedicated to September's Vogue, we certainly entered the new era of the Kardashian show.
Let her older sister, Kendall Kim, be found on the cover of Vegue earlier (she appeared with her husband, Kanya West, in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine was a self-executing achievement.
The September issue is the most widely sold issue in the year.
A gift similar to a fashionable magazine has been produced by a large number of advertisers (the Fashionista portal estimates that 615 pages of last year's 832-page edition were contained in advertising).
News of who gets on his cover from the stars is so eager that the photos of the magazine have faltered to the official anons over the past two years.
Former women caught on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has certainly been more “minorities that work as models” than “models that are famous”.
The Oscar Prize Laureate and the brandor Dior Jennifer Lawrence were presented on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga fell.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, who has been described by the magazine as the "distant model" of her generation, is in the first category, she's in a good company.
They are not relatives of famous people, stars of reality shows, or modern children who know how to make a good video at Snapchat (though Jenner gets into all these categories).
They are indeed talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonce, on last year's cover, this year was one of the best careers for Lemonade's album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
The position of Jenner in the fashion world, because of her past television reality show star, was always to be a mess.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seimur criticized Jenner and her colleague, Jiji Hadid, called them "the touch of the moment."
These moods rekindled after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vague.
But it doesn't make any sense to be upset.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of September's Vogue.
It is a supermodel in every sense.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you the Este Lauder ton.
She, and all her sisters, are selling your photographs to you in their same apps available on pay.
She sells hand-made photos of Cindy Crowford's daughter, LOVE.
And at a free time, maybe to still see her sister, Courtney, and her children, she's engaged in a reality show on TV.
Public legal centres refuse to service 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 least protected people are denied services at public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an impact that will further reduce funding by already taking action to the limit.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, those unable to combat unjust loss of property and so on — have already been denied access to free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside the scope of the scope are preparing further reductions.
Since June of the following year, these legal centres have had to lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Queensland Community Legal Centers, James Farrell, said that, according to a recent census of the National Association of Public Legal Centers, thousands of people are denied a year.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government's decision was not cancelled, the situation would only deteriorate.
"Divorce legal centres in Queensland are continuously receiving insufficient funding: this means that thousands of people are denied essential services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships with unmanageable and defunct duties, families going through divorce, unfairly dismissed workers — all of them have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 per cent since June 2017 and thus thousands of less protected people in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call upon George Brandes, the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland, to cancel those reductions immediately so that people can receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
The time has now come to focus on the needs of the public legal centres and communities, their clients, and the Government of Palau has got to take up this important work.
Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was tried after a staff member allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's election headquarters was put in court: it was alleged that the headquarters did nothing after his report that his operational director in North Carolina threatened the staff member with a gun while they were driving to the jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court suit filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte Winzent Bordina, former software instructor at the state pre-election headquarters.
Bordiny said he'd waited a few months for the problem to be resolved internally, but he realized it wouldn't happen.
Director Earl Phillip "sick the gun, put his right index finger on the hen and send a blower on Vincent's knee cup," says Bordiny in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional office of the pre-election headquarters, Bordiny realized that at least four other persons had become participants in similar incidents with Filippa, he had been admitted.
"The pirates don't have to shoot to cause damage," said Bordiny in a complaint.
The case took place just two days after the republican party presidential candidate introduced the furor, told North Carolina students that “the people of the Second Amendment” — understood as arms owners and loved them — could begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could elect judges.
The elected headquarters of Trump said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken out in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordiny claims compensation from the pre-election headquarters for careless control and from Philip for threats of physical violence, insults and moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks is slow in responding to a request for comment.
Attempts to speak to Philip were not successful.
WCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the election headquarters.
In response to calls from his consulting firm, the Innovation Advisory Services, no one called fast.
The candidate for the Presidents of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, launched a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Meklanburg District High Court (Sharlot).
Britain must put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand the Hithrou
It will also bring renaissance and prosperity, not only in our settlements here and in London as a whole, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the great advantage of Heathrow, just as it was for London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and East Enda.
And we'll do it again, creating opportunities for local people and firms next to Hithrow.
For our human settlements alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As was the case with London 2012, there will be those who think the task of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games, and that we would be in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will be proved wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hithrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Hitrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have a beautiful team in Hitrou, who introduced 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in a timely and budgetary manner, from T5 — the top airport terminal of five consecutive years to T2 — built in the middle of the two world ' s most employed airstrips.
They are now ready to provide the third runway, as confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The Olympic Games in London 2012 have been a great success for the British, and I am confident that the expansion of Hitrow will be too.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and to expand Hitrou to ensure our business future and to create the legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Heathrow Council and former Trade Attas of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing mouse-choice on the issue of advertising lock-ups.
For companies that earn money on the Internet ads, trying to bypass the ad-lock software is a kick-and-throw game, according to one of the companies that create such software.
On Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block ad lockers on its desktop version, Adblock Plus published a blog post to allow users to update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday Facebook, it was announced that the website’s desktop version was changing out around its ads to make it more difficult for advertisers to find out which parts of the page were advertisements.
But Adblock now says he was able to circumvent the new code.
In a blog post, the representative of Addblock Ben Williams wrote that “the kind of interplay between the open source blocker community and those who are trying to get past it continues from the moment the advertisement locks are invented”, and it is possible that Facebook will present its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the world ' s largest social network has entered the fight is a clear indication of the extent to which advertising blockers have become the biggest problem for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to last year ' s study, Pagefire and Adobe; almost four times the number who used such software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users entering Facebook through mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook revenue from advertising.
However, the company is trying to block ads on the desktop, as mobile advertisers are ineffective in the Facebook mobile social network and Instagram applications, according to the representative.
Still, ads in the desktop are quite profitable to Facebook see this as a beneficial investment.
Also on Thursday Facebook, I announced that I was going to update my tool of "adult preferences" to give people more control of how advertising was traded on them.
On Thursday Facebook, Adblock's new filters are of concern because they will also block some non-adblock content on the website.
“This will not be a good experience for people, and we are planning to solve this problem”, said the representative of Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertisers are a rough tool, so we instead focused on creating tools such as advertitions to hand over management to people.
Women moved to the Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police called for witnesses, after a woman had moved several vehicles to the highway early on Thursday morning, on an apparent suicide attempt.
An incident occurred at A1 near Morge in the canton of In immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman was hit by several vehicles on her way to the dark with a gesture of despair, reported to VP in a statement.
The victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was clearly hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
A number of drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and reports to the police calling on them and anyone who has witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was initiated, a “logistic” step in such a situation, and counseled Jile Hophstter Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, it remains to be determined whether anyone involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine,” Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case, both of which involve a person in the dark of a highway, were sentenced to a decision that motorists could not expect to see a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year an officer was acquitted of his death due to negligence after she struck and killed a man lying on A1 near Pierren the night of August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim of saw dust and lost consciousness on the road, heard the court.
The court found that the female police officer who responded to the emergency call was guided by a vehicle that had been justified and that the existence of a person on the road was “an exceptional and unpredictable situation”, the judge stated.
Someone who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morge should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 4444 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been alive, according to estimates of the new NASA climate model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Scientists from the North Space Research Institute, Goddard, developed a model for studying the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions such as Earth-like conditions could be found in Venus, with its hot water surface and atmosphere, transferred by carbon dioxide.
Scientists previously assumed that Venus's short speed was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modelling suggests that Venus may have had a sedentary atmosphere similar to the earth's, and still turning around slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but at one time there were enough water and enough geographical variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early city of Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent carcasse.
"In line with the GIS models, Venus's slow return offers the sun's daylight for almost two months at a time," explained a team of GilsS scholar Anthony Del Henio.
It warms the surface of the planet and makes rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that functions as an umbrella to protect the surface of the planet from a substantial part of the sun’s heat.
The result is an average climate temperature, which is surprisingly several degrees colder than it is today on Earth.
The model shows the story of Venus, similar to that of the previous planet scientists.
Although once inhabited, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans have failed and her water vapor has been driven by ultraviolet radiation.
When the hydrogen subsided, it was the dense atmosphere of the carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers shared their new climate model for Venus in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy's leaving the trainer for Avalanche.
Patrick Roy left the position of coach and vice president of hockey activities at Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, referring to a lack of influence in the team decision-making process.
The Executive Vice President / Chief Manager of the Colorado team, Joe Sacky, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have been serving as my chief coach and vice president of hockey activities, Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said Roy, 50-year-old in a statement.
During the summer, I have long and diligently thought about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and to raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the trainer and vice-President vision of hockey activities must perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of a team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
The Sack, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrik told me about his decision today," said Sacky.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish it a success in the future.
Roy became the winner of Jacks Adams Award as the best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He brought the club to 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado was destroyed by Minnesota in the first round of the Offs and lost a play-off in the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 during the 2015-2016 season and a five-point delay in the fight for a second concessionary pathway to the Western Conference.
Roy won four Stanley Cups, two from Montoreal Canadiens and one from Avalanche.
The North Sea oilists resume negotiations and suspend strikes
Working strikes on the salary of oil miners in the North Sea have been suspended, and all parties to the debate have come to a new round of negotiations and reported to the lead representatives of the parties.
Checks against the Wood Group oil service company have been irregularly organized on the North Sea platforms run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“The good Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process for the resolution of current disputes”, says the joint statement.
We will hold several meetings for a full day over the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of the next week, to look at the problems with fresh eyes.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wage reductions up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group this year reduced the rates paid by the Northern Sea contract workers by about 9 per cent because of the market ' s negative tensions.
The lower rate on the part of the company resulted from a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for the bank contract workers in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts would give it the space needed to overcome the recession.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to end oil and gas production activities in countries by up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-breeding with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of declining oil prices: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision to withdraw from the European Union, which was adopted in June by Britain.
A Scottish member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts that have arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, was vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion of new North Sea projects are expected to be in 2016, in contrast with an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the star in the Pleedus copy
The last mission of the Space Telescope, Kepler, helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of speeds of stars that form part of Pleeda’s accumulation.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the fossil are rotating at different speeds and how the rotation periods relate to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age, and even the history of its solar system”, said a press report to Louise Ribal, a research scientist at the Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The collection of Pleeda is 445 light-years from the Earth.
Many stars in the fossil are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They turn as fast as they never will.
At their peak speeds, these adult stars discharge large quantities of starry wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds have a braking effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its speed is beginning to slow down.
It measures the speed of each star by tracking the time between recognized star stains, such as solar stains.
The newer speed catalogue suggests that more massive stars rotate less slowly than less massive stars.
Fisheries compares stars to dancers: larger pyruates are slower than smaller ones.
"In "Breakette," we're seeing that those turning slowly, usually more massive, whereas those turning faster, usually refer to very light stars," said Ribal.
Since Pleeda is so close, it is an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of stars with the speed of rotation.
"The Pleiades ’ gravitation of stars provides a starting point for theoretical rotations of stars, both younger and older," said Ribal.
We still want to know how, where and why stars slow their speed and hang their dance shoes on the nail.
Ribal and her colleagues explained in detail their latest analysis of the speed of Pleeda's rotation in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
An investigation into the activities of a group of detainees in Crimea, Ukrainian dissidents, is conducted by two agencies, writes The Commersante.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of the Krima Diversity.
As previously reported, a resident in Ukraine town, Energodar Evgeny Panov, testified to cooperation with the consequence.
He said that as a diversion site, he saw the Titan chemistry in Armansk, the Feodosia oilbasa, the Kerchen ferry transport, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all dealers have been detained.
This has, inter alia, led to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Paradise of Simferopol, which is noted in the publication.
Stanislav Cherchesov became the leading trainer of Russia’s soccer team.
At the session of the populist of the Russian Football Union, a decision was made to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as the main trainer of Russia for football.
It will be contracted for two years, until the conclusion of the CMM-2018.
On 11 August, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the main coach for the Russian football team.
It is a well-known football player who used to play in Moscow's "Spartake" at the altar position, as well as a trainer with good experience, who was the mentor of Russian teams like the same Spartacus, "Jehzyna Sochi", "Terek", "Amcar", "Dinamo", and of "Legia", who was the winner of the country's national superiority and cup.
It is reported that Cherchesov's contract will be signed as soon as possible for two years.
It is thus his duty to prepare the World Championship for the 2018 World Cup.
His trainer headquarters is known to include Miroslav Romashenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Pannikov.
There is evidence that the total train headquarters will be $2.6 billion a year.
According to the media, the Russian Federation’s leadership has set the goal at Stanislav Chereszov’s to bring Russia’s total to the semifinal and to win medals.
As the trainer himself said, as a matter of priority, he saw the creation of a competitive environment in the team and was going to give footballers an opportunity to demonstrate themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he's glad he's had a choice for him.
The first match, led by Cherchevo's assembly Russia, will be held on August 31 in Antalya, which will be a social meeting with the Turkish team.
Remember, in the past, Leonid Sluskiy, who was the chief coach of the Russian football team, was involved with the CSAC club.
He announced his resignation following a live presentation by the Russian national team on Europe 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad results of his collection.
The burning of Angola and South Africa, Namibia, suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, after independence from South Africa in 1990, that country, with a population of 2.4 million people, had made tremendous progress, particularly over the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government is paying great attention to education.
While people in developed countries view primary and secondary education as reasonable, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary school fees are required.
Moreover, Governments often recommend “cost recovery” fees.
In Namibia, however, primary schools are free of charge.
Moreover, secondary education has also been provided free of charge since 2015.
The authorities are also active in other important areas.
Malaria eradication efforts have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Despite the international trend of inequality, Namibia is declining.
In comparison with 1993, the Gini coefficient, the standard inequality of income distribution, has dropped by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, it was one of the highest in the world.
And poverty declined from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) also fell, from nearly 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of expression ratings in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country was far ahead of the United States and other wealthy States.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Human Rights Defenders International Index of Persarence of Corruption.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia is able to maintain high rates of growth.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
Unemployment rates, at least in traditional methods of evaluation, remain high at almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, with nearly 17 per cent of the population infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is among the countries with higher average incomes, but the authorities insist that their State is indeed a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the challenges that weak economies face.
The State must develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
The country has isolated nomadic tribes of individual hunters who, in one way or another, must be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
Integration of people who, a quarter of a century ago were on the margins of the world economy is a challenge for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to give up, nor did it address the challenges facing it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities established a diversified economy and a united society.
Interestingly, competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
In fact, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia speaks of the construction of a wall that separates the country from the poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that they did not choose, but decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate, to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to encourage investment and to exchange students.
Furthermore, the Namibian Government had rightly reasoned that the rich natural resources could easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of many.
The authorities realize that the revenue from Namibia ' s natural resources needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacities.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum return on the sale of the country ' s resources, and review investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is so.
Transparency is crucial for that process, and the Government ' s strong support for freedom of speech is therefore so important.
The media often say things that they don't like, according to Hage Gyngb, head of State.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect its freedom, said the President.
Not all key resources in Namibia are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are renewable, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia has shown that even countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, the colonial order, inequality and underdevelopment - may be on the road to shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserved international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of "The Golden of Varna", the oldest gold objects ever built by man (4000 B.C.E. - 4,200 B.C.E.).
Perhaps it was the most powerful archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, a fantastic number of gold artefacts, more than 3,000 of the total weight of 6 kilograms, was found in Bulgaria.
Of only one grave known as “Milil No. 43”, 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg were recovered.
However, the official status of the ancient gold world is soon to shift to the unrivaled form of the bush found by archaeologists in July this year.
Again, in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as Tel Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tel Yunacité is located far from the sea near the village of Junacité of the Pazardjik district.
The Bush is a gold strip thrown in the ring.
Yavor Boyajiev, the digger at Telale Junacita, dated 4,600 years before our era and claimed that she was older than the gold of Varna for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna are, remember, dated around the same period, 4,600 to 4,200 to our era.
At present, there is no technology that allows metal to be dated with an impertinent accuracy.
How, then, can we be sure of what ancient gold is?
Apparently, Professor Boyajiev knows more than Reuters said, "I'm pretty sure that the gold of Junacité is older than the gold of Varna."
This is an extremely important thing: to think of it as a tiny object, but it's large enough to occupy a suitable place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Boyajiev, researchers will soon analyse the composition of the metal and explore the archaeological plastic where a gold artifact was found.
This will help to provide the best possible accuracy of the plant.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tel Yunacité, the settlement is famous even if you never heard of it.
Tel Yunacite is now regarded as Europe's oldest “city”.
The Tel was founded by descendants of people who migrate to Europe from Anatolia (now Turkey) in the 7,000th century before our era.
During the following centuries, metal processing in the region has developed violently, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the establishment of a full-fledged industry.
There is a specific name in the domestic history of this archaeological community: the Balkans-Carpathian metallurgical Province.
In the 5,000-year period before our era, city-type settlements began to develop around processing centres.
They are now known as the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tel Yunacitate may be the oldest, since artifacts were found in this area about 4900 before our era.
I'd call it the Tel Yunacite the prototype of the modern city, even though it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This place is above Sumer for a thousand years,” says Bojaiev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
The first cities were formed there in a familiar way.
The Tel Yunacite sites have been under way since 1976.
In the meantime, archaeologists have dug almost 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total settlement area.
The remains of the anchorage wall were found, which was once about six feet [3 m] high.
Few remains remained from homes and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, public buildings, city-wide dense buildings, a “business centre” and residential areas.
The Tel Junacité is often called the Avian City, where dozens of clay bird figures were found.
All the birds were depicted in a state of rest and it was assumed that they were not ornamental objects but the object of the local cult.
The Avian City was destroyed about 4,100 years before our era, possibly by the Indo-European tribes that came from north-east.
Travellers had no cities, but they had horses and weapons.
Three-metre anchorages didn't stop them.
Archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of atrocious slaughter: the remains of old men, women and children were found inside the houses, with traces of wounds inflicted by the war throes.
New findings and new facts are emerging every year, changing the way we think of ancient history.
The Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking, not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” of the first civilization of Europe born in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive to seek this civilization was the golden Varna, found relatively recently in 1972.
Logically, Varna's gold luxury was supposed to be ahead of something like a tiny gold buffalo that had been set up in Tella Junacit.
Porsche artificially outdated the 911 Targa model
It is officially stated that 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being trained manually by the officers of the unit who work with serial machines.
The Retro-Luk is, for example, the special color of the Etna Blue body, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, which is the color of even the model logo.
In addition, the Targa received a firm white schedule along the coast and a special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel disk, as well as some details of the bodywork painted in the white-golden metal.
In the interior, the retro-artics are much smaller: they are distinguished, on a large scale, by the gray-synme of the design, by new chairs with extended circuits of electrical adjustment and by separate, black-and-red steel thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, each buyer will receive a gift of Czech for the car and a rich split album with photographs of the production process when buying a special version.
Porsche Exclusive does not touch the power plant: the retro-tare is very similar to the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder motor with a turboaddy volume of 3.0 litres developing 420 ls and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S could accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released with limited circulation, neither its volume nor the cost of each particular sport will be reported.
Facebook and advertisers have untied the “arms race”
The recent introduction of Facebook as a technology that prevented the collapse of ads on social media pages has prompted decision makers to block advertisements for response.
And in AdBlock Plus, it's released, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon too.
So AddBlock Plus recommended his new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
The social media pointed out that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of “unlocked” advertising, the decision of AdBlock Plus, together with commercial advertisements, has blocked many of the normal positions of friends or pages.
Facebook deplored this policy, AdBlock Plus, and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to the source, TechCrunch’s social development code, which makes AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook’s decompopment site, will be ready within the next hours.
Thus, socialists and blockaders have unleashed a kind of “arms race” in an attempt to play each other, while users who have missed out on friends or saw advertisements where they did not get used to seeing each other have become victims.
The ethical aspects of advertising closure have recently been a cause of heated debate.
In Murmansk, the abuser will be brought to justice.
His case has already been concluded with the Inquiry Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murmanian Region.
The charges against a 54-year-old man are very serious: sexual assault.
The investigation found that at the end of November 2015, the accused had committed sexual acts in the Paula street in Murmansk using violence against a 20-year-old girl. The criminal case with an approved indictment was intended to be considered on the merits.
The provision of this article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng is brought to Russia by Crossil Fengung 370 and Rich New - Web site under the direction of www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a member of China's car class that combines the dignity of a minivan and a colossor.
Another declared Russian Prime Minister is a pickup by Rich New.
Many western firms in Moscow's International Motorway this year decided to ignore, so the void of the "Crocus Expo" exhibition halls will fill Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large species on the Russian market and will offer some interesting news to our auto lovers in the near future.
One of them will be Croscent Dongfeng Fengguang 370, sold in China in the spring at a price of 55,900 Yuan (just less than 550,000 roubles at current rates).
The Russian Federation is unlikely to see such a pricer, and the issue of transfers to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370, as a result of the June sales, was able to reach the 11th place on the list of the most-sold minivans, although due to the large road light (175 mm) and the protective plastic cover at the lower perimeter of the body it could well be counted for the krossomers.
Crossten is built on the front-line platform of the Fengang 360 model, in the 370s same wheel base, 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is salty, and the equipment is richer.
The Salon was painted with wooden tablets, but the large vertical sensory screen shown on Tesla on the central console was only on the early exhibits of the crossword, and machines with a musical were sold more easily.
Five of the seven landing places are easily constructed, consisting of a level loading area of 1,650 mm long and a maximum volume of 1,500 litres.
The Fengang 370 engine is equipped with only one, 1.5-litre petrol, at a 115-litre capacity.c. from a 5-step mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer is modest in its dynamic qualities, but promises a promising budget of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Picap Rich New is a well-known Russians, Nessan NP300 Navara of late generations, but a little bit of a watered Chinese styler design.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model is still a steady demand of the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unwelcome “working horse”.
At a similar price, Rich New would certainly be interested in the Russians, because modern Japanese pick-ups have become so expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for choice: petrol 2.4 l (137 l.s) or turbodilysel 2.5 l (116 l.s.).
The gearbox is only a mechanical, a transmission to the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigid front.
To be at Dongfeng and the new flagman sedan A9, his Russian Prime Mission sponsored in June.
Minveno-like crossovers in the Chinese market are on the rise, one of the latest news stories is the Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
The Dongfeng Russian lig currently consists of two models: sedated S30 and hetchbeck H30 Cross.
In seven months this year, 696 vehicles were carried out by dealers from a Chinese firm in our country.
Travel tax notices will cease to be sent by mail to www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending notices of property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to a non-changing year scheme: in the summer and autumn, they receive receipts for transport tax payments for the previous year.
However, this year many of them will not be waiting.
The fact is that the tax inspection, without too much noise, has changed the procedures for citizens' notification.
The notices will be made available electronically to those who are registered in the Conseil d'Etat on the official website of the department nalog.ru.
In the inspection, such Russians were automatically considered by online users and removed from standard, “paper” mailings.
The innovation concerns all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All others will continue to receive standard letters.
On the other hand, it is possible for users of the records on the website to return to the old scheme.
To that end, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notice will appear in the "personal office" immediately after writing, whereas the letter will go for a few days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of online tax service users killed 18 million people, which would allow the agency to save by mail in a serious way.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is obviously not enough to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some may have registered in the “personal office” for a one-time service and have long forgotten to do so.
They do not wait for notices, and without knowing them they will fall into the category of non-payments with all the consequences.
The front desk of the taxpayer is accessible in three ways: through the recording of the gosuslugi.ru portal, by electronic signature or by entering the logic and password specified on the registration card.
The latter may be obtained in person at any tax inspection office (whether or not the location of the accounting display).
We recall that this year the transport tax has to be paid before 1 December.
The notices began in July.
The Dunning Mercedes-Benz G class, in which it's designed to achieve a very high level of impact, is something in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of G- Pauler, who started to change Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G- Pauler is known for his passion for BMW cars, but nothing more than human masters.
In fact, why not improve the G 63 - 571-strong plumbing of aerobic tank and the run-up of hundreds for 5.4 s?
You know, by scooping out the "beautiful", the master took advantage of the advantages that the five-year-old inflatable eight-year-old would have had.
And here's the pattern of the run-up to hundreds of years improved for indistinguishable 0.1 seconds, and now the flying Kimpic is capable of breaking for 5.3 seconds.
However, the acceleration from average speed is certainly better given.
Speed ceiling: If standard G 63 faster than 210 km/h does not travel, a tuner with a deactivated electronic "integrated" can reach 250 km/h.
With the exception of the other wheel discs, the 23-inch Hurricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach Luca unit has denounced an amazing conceptual bath with a length of 6 m, which will be presented in the context of the Elegance Competition in Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the BMW i green subbrand and will advance its electrical models under a separate trade mark.
A minimum of four green-news are expected to emerge in the coming years.
