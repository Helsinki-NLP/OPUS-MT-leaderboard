Members of the Wales Assembly don't want to "go to cartpetts"
Among some members of the National Assembly, there will be a reluctance to accept for their name the abbreviation MWP (in the form of the Member of the Wales Parliament).
A problematic solution relates to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One Leborist, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “must be worth Twp and Pwp”.
It's not from Wales for our readers: the Vallian twp means "picke", but pwp means "taske."
According to a member of the Assembly from the Wales Party, his organization as a whole was “unsatisfied” and offered other options.
Conservative parties are “not opposed” to the new abbreviation but note that MWP is close to Muppet (mappet).
In this context, the word w in the Wally language is pronounced approximately as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing a draft law on the name change, made the following statement: “A final decision on how Assembly members will be named, of course, will remain behind them”.
The Wales Management Act of 2017 has the power to change the name of the Wales National Assembly.
In June, the Committee published a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the Wells Parliament instead of the Assembly had gained widespread support among the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred in favour of the “Cleans of Wales” option (Welsh Paper Members, or WMP), while the MWP version received the greatest public support.
It seems that members of the Assembly are proposing other options, but the presiding officer, Elina Jones, will find it difficult to find a satisfactory solution, and recall that the draft change law should be submitted within a few weeks.
Reform laws would include other modifications to the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on the discrimination of members of the Assembly and the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly will vote for a final name in the debate on the draft law.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum for their country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia will vote to rename the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A popular vote is intended to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the term “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims for Greek Province and has repeatedly opposed the accession of its northern neighbour to Europe and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, opposed to the referendum for the change of name, stated that he did not intend to accept his results.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that the change in the country ' s name is at the very cost of joining the EU and NATO.
Criticism in the Garlem Comings: St. Martin's circle was forever silenced
“The area I've been communicating with has been described earlier as being at every corner of the hall in the bar and in the church, ” says Adams.
“Now there is no one left.”
The loss of bars is still to be understood as follows:
“The body of communication has changed”.
“Bar ceased to be a sort of guest in the whole area to which he regularly visited”.
But with regard to the churches, it is disturbing that funds derived from the sale of assets will not be long enough, however their leaders may fall asleep.
At the seat of the church, he added, there would be a multi-family building whose tenants were unlikely to support the remaining arrivals in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” says Adams.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black area — the Metropolitan Comunity in 1870 and the Church of St. Martin 10 years later.
The first native Methodist Church left in the 1930s.
Their building was purchased by a black building next door.
When St. Martin's church came into the hands of the black community, she was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who had organized a boycott of shops on the 125th street, the main trade artery of Garlem, where he refused to hire or raise black people.
In 1939, the building was significantly damaged by the fire, and during the reconstruction work of Father Johnson, a carillon was ordered.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who replaced him with St. Martin’s church, proudly referred to the carillon as “coloss for the poor. ”
But the expert who tried the carillon in July called it the “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that it was the Church of St. Martin carilion that was the first of its kind in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. He was invited 18 years ago to play a larger Carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Meriuster, the Church of St. Martin still hasn't found a replacement for him.
Over the past few months, the Church of St. Martin has been in a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular church leaders and others by the Episcopalian Episcopalian diocese.
A resident assembly, which included secular leaders, turned to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to transfer the cost of work” to a gathering, although the latter had no connection with the choice of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some delegates expressed dissatisfaction at the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old diver who designed to produce frontal looters
Officials report that on Saturday, the first day of the lobbying season, a 13-year-old diver was attacked and injured by a shark in California.
The attack occurred about 7 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel, in an interview with the SSWB-TV station, San Diego, he dived with his friends on Saturday morning, and after about half an hour, he was told of the boy's calls for help, and they and their friends went by the boat to the scene of the attack and pulled the adolescent out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first decided that the boy was very excited about taking a frontman, but he quickly said, "I've been bitten by him!
I was bitten!"
He came to the diver, Hammel noticed that “his skin was completely torn around his keys”.
“ I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: ‘Here is a shark, ’ ” says Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Radi Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition was assessed as critical.
The species of shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Hayles, reported during a press briefing that a shark had been observed a few weeks earlier but had not been classified as dangerous species.
Heils also added that the victim of the attack was injured in the upper body area.
The authorities closed the zone from the Punto beach in Casablanca to the Swami beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
He observed that there were 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them were not considered dangerous.
Sainesbury plans to conquer Britain's perfume-cosmetic market
Seinesbury is going to install cosmetic and perfume divisions at Butes, Superrog and Debenhams with cosmetologists in the Lux Warming Model.
The British Parfummer Cosmetic Market is estimated at Pound2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and home-based goods are falling, and many other shops will be expected to do so in the next year if they are successful.
The owners of supermarkets seek to fill the regiments that used to be on TV, microwave furnaces, home-based goods, and investment in the perfume-cosmetic market are a good solution.
According to the Sainesbury representatives, it is planned to double the number of cosmetics to 3,000; for the first time, stamps such as Revlon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be proposed.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burton's Bees will be represented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by the type of organization of goods at Butes.
In addition, a firm-based "Scottique" of products will be reorganized to meet the needs of young buyers.
The two shops in Sainesbury will have the food products of Fragrance Chop, the first of which has already opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second is expected to be opened in Selli Oak, Birmingham, this year.
The Internet trade and the tendency to buy small quantities of food every day in small benches near home have led to the pressure of supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, president of Sainesbury, says that the athletes will gradually turn into a department store, and his network of supermarkets fights for buyers in competition against cheap shops, such as Aldie and Lidl, offering more services and non-food goods.
There are hundreds of Sainsbury supermarkets where Argos athletes are located, and some of them now find Habitats stores since the net acquired both stamps two years ago, which led to an increase in the sales of food products and proceeds from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts at a supermarket to give new life to its cosmetic and pharmacist divisions have failed.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture was organized between Sainsbury and Butes, but further differences arose between the participants on the question of income-sharing from the sale of pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Sainesbury pharmaceutical business (281 shops) of Celecio, the owner of Lloyds Farmasi network, within £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a broad line of luxuries to the skin care of La Roche-Pasey and Vicey in four shops.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetic divisions so as to create a better environment for our buyers.
We have also invited trained consultants who will always be ready to assist the board.
It's a whole new concept of shopping."
Peter Jones “pourly” responded to Holly Willoughby's exit of the deal by £11 million
Peter Jones' "fired" came from a 11 million pounds deal television player Holly Willoughby, which she intended to have entered into with Peter's Lafstale-brand, but preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV instead.
Willowby doesn't have time for their joint brand of household clothes and exessors Truly.
This couple's business was compared to that of Goove actress Gwyneth Peltrow.
The 37-year-old leading programme “This morning” announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willowby's decision to leave their profitable Leifstal-brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV led to the rage of Peter Jones, the star of the Dragon Fire.
As reported by our sources, Jones was “warned” when a TV lover at a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after new contracts had been entered into, up to 1.5 million hours, she would not have enough time for their common brand of household clothes and accessorys, Truly.
Their brand was compared to the actress Gwynth Peltrou's label for Goop, and it was expected that its sale would double Willowby's estimated position of £11 million.
A 37-year-old lead announced his withdrawal from Instagram, while Jones himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly's dream was the top priority of Holly.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure her a carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Its decision had led to the steppe of all parties to the transaction.
Everyone was shocked on Tuesday, since the weeks before the stamp was launched.
At the headquarters in Marlow, there was a complete warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that leaving the leading “This morning”, one of Britain’s most popular stars, could cost a firm millions of pounds because of significant investment in goods ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as from potential delays in launching a line.
It is also the breakup of long-standing friendships.
Willowby’s raising three children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with John and his wife, Tara Cappe, for ten years now.
Willowby set up a Truly stamp with Tara Cap, in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company in March.
Both couples often leave together, and Jones also owns 40 per cent of the stock of Dan Baldwin's television production.
Willowby will be the Ambassador of M&S and will replace Anthony McParlin as the lead on the ITC "I Am Famous."
The source from John's nearby neighborhood said last night, "We can't comment on his business dealings."
Difficult negotiations, “and then we have loved each other”
He was joking about the criticism of the media due to the comments and appreciation of North Korea's leader for the “indecent president”.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Trump said, imitating the lead news.
"No, I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim Chen Yang was interested in a second meeting, after Trump named them the first summit, held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards the reduction of nuclear weapons stocks in North Korea.
But denuclearization negotiations have come to a halt.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high-level North Korean diplomat Lee Yong-Ho addressed world leaders at the Saturday meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, stating that North Korea is still awaiting “responsible response” from the United States following the initial Democratic People's Republic of Korea disarmament measures.
Instead, the United States, noted the diplomat, continues to use sanctions as a tool for pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
“The North Korean business is great, ” he said.
“We were on the verge of a North Korean war.
Millions of people could die.
And now we have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong Eun were bearing fruit: an end to the missile tests, the hostages were released, and the remaining United States soldiers also returned to their homeland in the DPRK.
Speaking of his relationship with Kim Jong Eun, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not unusual.
“To be apt to the President is so simple, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street who burst into this fully slain hall, there would be only 200 people here, ” said Trump, pointing to the crowd he had gathered before him.
tsunamis and earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction recorded and casualties calculated at hundreds
In the early days of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NEOs said they did not need assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had lost its roof over its head, the Government did not find it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that international support was not needed, so it was difficult, ” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palau, but we do not yet know whether a foreign group will be able to work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sotopo, official representative of the National Disaster Management Office, Indonesia is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palau to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
In view of the ongoing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country continued to be terribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although the tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastal lines.
Despite the tsunami warning, sirens were not included in Palau to alert the population, which is likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
Transport between the numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital, formerly moored in Lombok to assist earthquake victims, is to Palau, but the road to a new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Viodo has strengthened Indonesia ' s infrastructure branch by the main point of his pre-election campaign, and has spent invaluable funds to improve roads and railways.
However, President Joko's administration, running for a new term next year, has been caught up with funding problems.
The President is also criticized for increasing interfaith hostility between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people have been killed, and tens of thousands more have been killed as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other self-guns.
Video: Daniel Starridge's Liverpool player compares the score to the chalse's shoulder at the far top of the gate

In an interview to the LiveropolFC.com website, Starridge said, "It was all about getting on that position and getting a ball, like Shack's, always playing the attack, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible."
“I saw Kanté's way to me, had a ball, and I went through the gate for a little while thinking.”
As a result of the first half of the match, Chelsea led an account of 1-0 and killed a Belgian, Eden Azar, at 25 minutes.
The central attacker, Celsi, handed over Matteo Kovachiča back, broke through the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
In the middle of the field, Kovačić played a game of one touch.
He then handed over the passage to Azar, who had entered the gate.
Azar denied protection and from the left flank struck the roadside of the Liverpool altar, Alison Becker, striking the distance of the grid.
Liverpool will meet with the "Napoli" team at the group stage of the Champions League, and the match will be held at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.

The monument Cromwell, before the Parliamentary Building, called for a bitter discussion on the “rewriting of history”
Cromwell's exile would have been a well-deserved retribution for the barbarous destruction of England's numerous cultural and religious artefacts by its followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society referred to Mr. Cryk's proposal as “a natural attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldmite, president of Cromwell’s Memorial Society, stated: “In the ongoing debate about the demolition of historical monuments, the question of Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of the Westminster Palace inevitably arose.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English civil wars.
Oliver Cromwell may have suffered for the sins of his ancestors, Thomas, who had lived for centuries earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hammo Tornitrophes, reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldmite said: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell to be the attorney of Parliament against external pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Whether such an opinion is historically accurate remains the subject of expert debate.
But it can be said with certainty that the conflict of the mid-17th century has affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of the section.
His achievements as the Protector Lord are also to be commended and respected.”
A Chinese farmer killed a killer pig
In one of the markets in south-west China, a farmer was a victim of pigs and reported on by local media.
The victim's blood-blooded body (only referred to in the media as his last name, “Yuana”), with a broken artery, was found near the market cool in Lupanshu province of Guechhou in southern China, reports The Morning Post on Sunday.
Lead is preparing to introduce pig vaccinations at the pig farm on May 30, 2005, Sinin district of the China province of Qinghai.
Yuan and his cousin came from the neighbouring province of Junnan on Wednesday and were brought to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found the unmanned body of Yuanja, and the door to the neighboring pigsman was opened.
There was a huge bunny in the pighole with blood on the red line.
The forensic report found that the pig weighed 250 kilograms in weight had buried the farmer at death.
“My brother’s feet were bloodstained and twisted, ” told Guyyang Evening News, a relative of the victim.
The video of the observation camera showed that Yuan had come to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig was not from the brothers.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been isolated in a separate team during the investigation in order to avoid repeated attacks.
The Yuanja family is reported to have been negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the farmer ' s death.
It is not often the case of pig attacks on people.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., seriously traumaing a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal drove a Walli peasant to a tractor and let him go, only afraid of a late wife.
In 2012, there was a case of a farmer from the state of Oregon in the United States who was eaten with his own pigs, according to a Canadian farmer CBC News channel, pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood bite can act on their latent aggression as a “output mechanism”.
"The pigs of the players,
They're bitumenous and very curious, but they don't have to hurt you.
You just need to teach your animal a sense of measure and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to a large part of the south-west United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as he travels across the cooler zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring flooding and flooding into northern Mexico and south-west United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York City, the cyclone had reached 1st category with winds up to 135 km/h, 36 kilometres south-west of Punta Euhynia (Mexico).
A hurricane is expected to move north by Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure zone is beginning to develop over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the west coast of the United States, near the coast of Lower California, and will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico to the United States south-west.
More than 25 cm of rainfall is expected on Monday in Mexico.
Tropical humidity in the emerging low pressure zone is expected to cause heavy rains in the south-west in the coming days.
Rainfalls from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous rainfall floods, dirty streams and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, particularly in the south of Nevada and Arizona, high tropical humidity may cause rainfall to reach a rate of 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In selected parts of the United States south-west, most of the Arizon area is expected to reach between 5 and 10 cm of rainfall.
The risk of sudden, rapidly developing floods is not precluded because of the uneven distribution of tropical rain.
With the current risk of a tropical downpour, walking in the desert can have serious consequences.
The waves can turn the kanions into stormy rivers, and thunder can cause the winds to blow up and lift the clouds of dust.
The area of low pressure is hit by torrential rains on the southern California coast.
It is possible to drop up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which may cause small mud-creature flows and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
These are the first rainfalls since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and mornings in Arizona, tropical rains will be covered by Monday evenings and Tuesday mornings.
By Tuesday, the raindrops will be over in four corners and will last until afternoon.
In October, there will be a sharp drop of temperature throughout the United States, due to low Arctic air temperatures at fairly high tropic temperatures.
Sometimes such a combination results in a strong drop of temperature in a small area.
Such sharp temperatures will be particularly evident in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 20 degrees between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other areas.
In most of the central and eastern United States territories, warm weather is expected at the beginning of October to reach 27 degrees in the area from the southern plains to the north-east of the country.
In New York, the air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, 10 degrees above the average on Tuesday.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an unusually high temperature on the east coast of the United States until mid-October.
The Senate hearing in the case of Judge Britta Kavano saw over 20 million viewers
The testimony of Britta Kavano and Christine Blazi Ford, who accuses Cavano of attempted rape in the 1980s, paid attention to over 20 million viewers of six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition to the application of the candidate to Cavanao continued unexpectedly, and an urgent message was sent to the media on Friday: Republican Jeff Flake made a condition that the charges against the lawyer be investigated by the FBI within a week.
As Ford said at the hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she was confident “100 per cent” that Kavano had attacked her in a state of intoxication and tried to take her out at a school party.
Cavanano gave emotional testimony, claiming that 100 percent were sure that this was not the case.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, Friday’s debate was attended by over 20.4 million viewers.
The Agency took into account average statistics from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The number of audiences of other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network is not yet available.
Also, the Nielsen rating does not always take into account the viewers watching the workplace.
For comparison: this is an average audience watching a American football game game or an Oscar service ceremony.
The largest audience was at Fox News Channel, who was warmly supported by the appointment of Cavanano: the Senate hearing, which lasted all day, looked at an average of 5.69 million viewers, and reported to the Nielsen agency.
In second place, ABC of 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, reports Nielsen.
After a hearing, interest in the matter is almost limited.
There was a real drama with Jeff Flake on Friday.
After the senator from Arison, who was considered to be a moderate republican, announced his intention to support the candidature of Kavano, CNN and CBS were able to lock on the camera, as he met on Friday morning on the way to the meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake met in an elevator with a group of activists who were critical of the senator.
The whole world has seen him drop his eyes and get a shot from angry women live on CNN.
"I am standing with you," said one of them.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
“For you the strength, while so many women are powerless,” tried to explain their position.
Flake answered to activists that his office had already prepared a statement and that he would address the subject at the committee meeting.
When, a few hours later, the Legal Committee was prepared to approve the nomination of Kavano as judge and to send her to the Senate for a general vote, all the television channels broadcast live.
Flake, however, placed one condition on which the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate by the following week as a democratic minority was seeking.
Flake claims to have changed his mind because of the intervention of a friend, a senator from the Cris Kuns democracies.
He made a final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
The Flake decision had an effect because it was apparent that the Republicans did not have a vote to approve the Kavano without an investigation.
By decree of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charge against Kavano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses his critics of “political games” around the situation with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of putting a narrow-based interest above the public interest.
The British Prime Minister is arriving at a conservative party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was published in one lane with May, former M.D.M. Bory Johnson criticized her so-called "Shucks" plan in Brexita, stating that he considered the introduction of customs duties between Great Britain and the EU to be “totally poor”.
Death of Wade Sims in gunfire: The police arrested Dianon Simpson on suspicion of murder of the Forvard of the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the University of Louisiana.
According to the Baton-Ruze police, 20-year-old Décion Simpson was arrested and detained on second-use murder charges.
The police published a video of the fights between Sims and Simpson, where Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, the regional CBS channel, the police found Simpson DNA on glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson confessed that Wade had been fatally wounded.
According to Advocate, an amount of $350,000 has been set for Simpson.
On Friday, the head and neck of the eastern district of Baton Ruza issued a preliminary opinion: death was caused by a cross-sectional gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Criminal Investigation Division of the State of Louisiana, the State Police Criminalist Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local population, who assisted in the ongoing search and investigation activities that led to the detention.
Joe Alley, Director of Sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the forces of law and order for their “good work to help the criminal”.
Simsu was only 20 years old.
A two-metre forward was a native of Baton-Ruz; his father, Wayne, was also playing at the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, Sims had a total of 5.6 points and was able to make 2.6 choices, on average, for the match.
A trainer, Will Wade, made a statement on Friday morning, saying that Wade Sims' tragic death had caused “socks” and“ present woes” from all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of, ” added the coach.
The volcano covered the ashes of Mexico City
The Mount Popocatepetl fell asleep in the southern regions of Mexico’s capital city.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention of Mexico recommended that the population do not approach the volcano, with 183 steam gas emissions recorded in its crater and completed in 24 hours.
According to the Center, the area near the volcano was often shriveled by the grooves and the heat felt.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko, social network users published photographs of frontal glass of cars covered with thin layers of ashes.
Following the magnitude earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which struck the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded an increased volcanic activity of 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
The volcano Popocatepetl (or, for its part, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Clashes of police with Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, a multi-year meeting was held in Barcelona on the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which split the country into two camps.
The police pushed the protestors of independence away, while the last masked in black masks threw the peace of eggs and powdered paint, raising the clouds of dark dust at the heart of Barcelona.
The riots resumed with renewed force after the police had set off their batons to contain the crowd.
For several hours, the independenceists complained, “I won't forget, not just!” and their opponents answered with the slogan, “Drive Spain!”
According to the local press, 14 shareholders were admitted to a hospital with light injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held to withdraw Catalonia from Spain, which was recognized as an illegal Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for separatists, and one year later tension persisted in the region seeking sovereignty.
The Catholic vote was very high in favour of the withdrawal from Spain, but the appearance was low because the opponents were mostly boycottted by the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, during the past year, during attempts by the police to block a referendum in the country ' s polling stations, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes.
On Friday, separatists laid down a demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to prevent it from being carried out.
The demonstration took place anyway, but it went on a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narciss Termez, who visited a meeting of separatists in his wife's company, claimed that the hope of Catalonia's acquisition of sovereignty was becoming increasingly challenging.
“Last year we saw one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents were crying for happiness, being able to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a state of high esteem, ” he said.
In the recent December elections to local governments of the Catalan parties in favour of separation from Spain, however, the movement is losing its supporters, since many of the leaders of the movement are either in flight or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanics recording a police support rally on the phone, said that the conflict was being heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The voltage is high, ” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participating in the next election to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government”, he said.
Londonerry: The car crashed into the house, all three of them arrested
One of the homes in London was hit several times by a car; men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested.
The train took place on Thursdays around 7:30 local time in the Ballinaard Creent area.
As a result, the gates and the building were damaged and the police inspector Bob Blammings was informed.
There are reports that a bow shot could have been fired into the car.
Livingston's victory over the Rangers because of Mengi's distinctive nude
First Lord Dolly Mengi brought a guaranteed victory to the Livingston team
Livingston's killed ball won an unexpected victory over the Rangers, for the leading trainer at the Scottish Club, Stephen Gerard, only second in 18 games.
Dolly Mangi's exact impact compared the team Gary Holt to the Hibernian Club in a credit table where they divide the second place.
The Gerard's Club was left without a victory on its way out to the Prime League season, and on Sunday they had a meeting with the team leaders, the Hars, from which the Rangers laged on eight points.
On Thursday, Rangers will host a League of Europe match with the Austrian club Rapaid (Vienna) on its field.
The Livingston Club continues its gameless series of playing six matches and has not suffered any damage since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as chief coach of the team.
Lost moments for Livingston in contact with nagging guests
Trusted coach Holt had to keep an account from the very beginning — the Rangers had clearly failed to deal with them.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the defense line, but the naked one of his weak attempts didn't come out, and then a lawyer, Alan Litgo, fainted too wide, couldn't prevent Keege Hallett from getting onto the grid.
The host party allowed the Rangers to play in front of their defence line, counting on the danger of relaunching the game.
That is how they missed that important goal.
The Rangers made a free blow, and Livingston took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson transferred Menge, who killed him from a central position.
At that point, Rangers had the advantage of controlling the ball, but the protection of the host team was not a test, so Liam Kelly's altar was not concerned.
The second half continued in the same pattern, although Kelly still had to strike off Alfredo Morelos.
The Rangers altar, Allan McGregor, was hit by Scott Pittman's ball, and Little made a big pitch out of standard position.
While constantly caught in Livingston's fine, all the attacks were reflected, and the Panel's two demands, one for triggering Glenn Middlelton's back game and the other for playing with the hand, were not met.
Livingston's “Fonomental” game - analysis
From BBC Scottland to Alader Lamont, report from The Toni Macareon Aren
It's a fantastic game and a great result for the Liwingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their entry into the soccer Olympics.
Their style of play and composition has remained virtually unchanged since they were renegotiated to top-level ratings, and coach Holt's great credit for having mobilized this team from the beginning.
There were a lot of real heroes in his team.
Captain Halket was in charge of an excellently organized defence, and Menga was not allowed to relax Connor Goldson and Joe Warall.
The Rangers could not, however, enter the rhythm.
Although they had good play moments with Coach Gerard, this time they failed to meet our expectations.
In the last few minutes, they lacked access to the ball and were able to go through the protection of their host team only once. The Rangers, who had fallen into the middle of the table, had something to think about.
Irdogan's cool reception during her visit to Cologne
Saturday, 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast, there was a wonderful weather, and both of the tops were in a great mood.
This was the last day of President Erdogan ' s visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO participating countries, a visit that already involved some conflicts.
Heads of country failed to find understanding on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey ' s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of an enormous new mosque.
The largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey lives in Kelvin.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25-month crowd to enter the mosque, but many of Erdogan's supporters stayed nearby to see their president.
Opposers to the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered at the same location to condemn in full both Erdogan ' s policy and the German Government ' s decision to invite him to visit Germany.
The fact that there are radical opposite views at the meeting reflects the mixed nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots are overshadowed by Erdogan, while others consider it a tyrant.
Desptford Road Accidents: collision with a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, the car encountered a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred near Besud Street and Evelyn Street, a busy crossing to the south-eastern city of Depefort, about 10.15 local time.
The driver of the car and the ambulance were trying to help the cyclist, but the man died unconscious.
It is not the only fatal accident in the area: only about a mile [1.5 km] from the scene on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver was hiding.
The London Police reports that work is currently under way to identify the deceased and to notify his or her immediate family.
In the meantime, roads are closed and bus routes are changed, while motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Tremendous in Long Latin Prison: Six police officers were injured
According to Long Lantin, six policemen were injured in riots in a male security prison.
The Long-Lartin male prison (Wusstershire) has continued on Sundays with unrest around 09:30 local time.
To suppress disturbances involving eight prisoners from a single wing, the Tornado Task Force was called.
The police were slightly damaged by the mild tissue of the person; they were given local medical care.
According to a prison official, “specially trained staff have been recruited to resolve the incident in Long Lantin Correctional.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically deny the use of physical force in our institution, and it is obvious that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their precautionary measure may be changed for a longer term.”
Over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country, are currently being held in Long Lantin.
In June, the media reported that a prison manager had been admitted to a hospital and had been attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October of last year, the prison authorities were forced to engage special-purpose units to calm down broken prisoners who had to throw balloons in their wards.
Hurricane Rosa may sink the Phoenices, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit drylands)
Arizona rarely enters the zone of an intense tropic cyclone, but this time it was lucky: at the beginning of the following week, Hurricane Rosa, with his last shot, must pass over the desert part of South-West and risk flood floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of flood floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Felix, Flagstuff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to follow the straight line over the Feniks on Tuesday and to flow in the water on Monday evenings.
The office of the National Meteorological Service at Feniks reported in Twitter that “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression, in a radius of 320 km from Felix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 kilometres from the Arisone border.”
The National Meteorological Service has recently predicted that between 5 and 10 centimetres will fall, reaching a point of 15 cm on the Mogolon Rome plateau.
In other desert regions of South-West, such as central rock mountains and Big Bassein, it is possible to drop to between 2.5 and 5 cm of precipitation, and can reach 10 cm of rainfall.
The rain produced by Hurricane Rosa can be a blessing for the areas to which torrential rains will bypass. The region has long suffered drought.
Although flood floods may pose a danger, heavy rains can ease the dry season that is not taking place in the United States south-west.
According to U.S. Dought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizon’s territory has at least a severe drought (second in gravity), ” reports the websiteweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will attack Mexico’s state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane of 137 km/h has a maximum speed of 360 kilometres south of Punta Euhya (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Hurricane is in the cooler water zone on the Pacific Coast and thus loses its force.
In the afternoon, the storm will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
It is expected that massive flooding will take place in parts of Mexico, at risk of flooding.
“The area from Lower California to the north-west of Sonora may fall to between 7 and 10 cm of precipitation, up to 25 cm, ” reports the websiteweather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will then travel north across Mexico and the early morning, he will reach the Tropical Cyclone border on Tuesday, which will reach southern Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The basic potential risk posed by Hurricane Rosa and its remains is the heavy torrent valleys in Lower California, in the north-west of Sonora, and in the desert areas of the south-west United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
It is expected that rainfall will cause dangerous rainfall floods, muddy torrents in the desert and possible landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four suspects detained in attempted murder
In Somersat, a 16-year-old boy was severely stabbed, suspected of attempted murder by three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy.
Victims of serious injuries were found in the Exellsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4 a.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition was assessed as “hard”.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radtok district and reported to the Avon and Somerset District Police.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to the crime with any video recordings of the mobile phone.
Donald Trump: "In Cavanano, "all hatred, all wickedness" of the democracies"
“The Golos for Judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the democracies,” said Trump at a meeting of his fellow partners in Wilinga, West Virginia.
In Trump's view, in the process of approving Kavano's nominee as a candidate, “all hatred, all anger” of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Cavanaugh testified in the U.S. Congress, in his emotional treatment categorically rejected the accusation of Christine Blazi Ford that he had sexually tried her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also gave a statement during the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the U.S. President said that on that day “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage” of Kavano.
“The voice for the approval of Judge Kavano is the approval of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, with an unhesitating public record,” declared the President of the crowd of his fellow workers in the state of West Virginia.
In his speech, the President indirectly raised the issue of Kavano's nomination, referring to the importance of Republicans appearing for the elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“ The most important election in our life is only five weeks.
I don’t share in them, but I’m not involved in the race in another way, ” he said.
“I am making my way like a cornered man and fighting for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the democracies have given themselves the task of “every effort to resist us”.
According to the Rules, the first key vote at the Kavano Senate for approval should take place no later than Friday, and the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party informed him.
Indonesia ' s earthquake has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of casualties continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, many had suffered from the giant waves that seized the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which had been hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the weather were the hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in the city of Palau, where on Friday, a wave of about six metres hit the coast that swept everything down its path and led to the sudden death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm was declared yesterday, people continued their beach vacations instead of immediately running into hiding, and as a result they lost their lives, ” reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Office during a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunamis didn’t arrive, and there were cars, logs, and whole houses, that destroyed everything on its way, ” explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the ocean at 497 km/h and had hit the coast with all its might.
Some of those present left on trees to save their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palau.
An aerial survey of disaster management has revealed destroyed homes, shops, bridges and flooding mosques.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still rocked by underground formations.
A series of earthquakes took place in the territory with a population of 2.4 million.
The statement by the Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the result of the earthquake-induced energy emissions was about 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected, thanks to the geographic location of the city at the end of the long, narrow Gulf.
Nugroho described the damage as “great”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the damaged buildings; 540 persons were injured, and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho added that the victims and destruction could be even more significant along the coast by 300 km from Palau, in Dongala, which was closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications from Dungal were “fullly destroyed, without any information”.
“There are over 300,000 people living in the Danube region”, says the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already been sent to the disaster zone.
“A tragedy has occurred, but it is not a limit, ” says the communication.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized because it did not report the tsunami in Palau on time; however, it is believed that waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
Social networks have developed a amateur video that tells a man on the top floor of a building that cries out for a tsunami, desperately trying to draw people's attention on the street.
After a few minutes, a wall of water breaks into the beach, carrying whole homes and cars.
The Reuters Agency has not yet been able to confirm its authorship.
The earthquake and tsunami have resulted in large electrolysis, which has left communications in Palau, making rescue operations very difficult.
Military transport aircraft were dispatched from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuees are still lacking food and basic necessities, and government sources report.
The city ' s airport was only opened for humanitarian assistance; it would be closed until October.
On Sunday, the evacuation centres in Palau will be visited by President Joko Viodo.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the Charity of the World Vision arrived safely from Dungala in Palau, where they found a hiding place in the tarpaulins of their office building, which, according to Doseb Sinai, was on their way, a terrible sight of destruction.
“They have seen a great many destroyed houses, ” he relates.
The situation is very bad.
Beneficial organizations have begun to implement humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that international NCB specialists have not been able to reach Palau.
Indonesian legislation allows funding, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations only after a disaster has struck the area of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed to be a local disaster, ” reports Aulia Ariani, a press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares a national disaster, we will be able to accept foreign assistance, but the status remains unchanged”.
On the second day after the natural disaster struck Palm, friends and relatives of those who have disappeared still look forward to their miraculous salvation, which will restore faith in the best.
On Saturday, a young boy was rescued and fell into a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers removed a woman's building from the debris that spent two days there, next to her mother's untreated body.
Hendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia ' s National Paraplanerism, prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among the others trapped in the Roa Hotel were his disciples, including the Mandagis.
“I am not the last person in this sport, and it is emotionally difficult to survive, ” he said.
Hedon recalls that when he learned of the damage to the Roa Roa Hotel from other paraplanists, over the next hours, he desperately tried to contact the General App with his colleagues from Palau on a beach festival.
His reports, however, were displayed with one series of pins, not two blues.
“This means that no communications have been delivered”, he believes.
Destructive theft of $26,750 during the operation of a ATM in Newport-on-Livi
On Friday morning, abusers stole $26,750, from the inquisitor Brink's, who runs one of the bankers in Newport-on-Livi, according to a Newport Police press release.
According to researcher Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored microbus took the cash from the ATM located in the entertainment complex and was going to supply it with new notes.
During this time, the Brink's backs came up with an abuser and stole a bag of bank notes for the banking of a ATM.
According to witnesses, several suspects had fled the crime scene, but the number of potential participants was not indicated by the police.
A citizen who has any information about these persons is requested to contact the New Zealand Police Department, number 859-292-3680.
A rapper changed the name of Yee.
Rapper Kanje West made a new name: Ye.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter: “The character formerly known as Qanje West”.
The 41-year-old West has been wearing this pseudonym for a long time and has even put it in the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The news of this appeared in the run-up to Kanya's modern Night Live, where he plans to introduce his new Junji album.
Kanje West will be the co-convener instead of Ariana's singer, who cancelled his participation because of “emotional anxiety”, informs the transferer.
West stated earlier that it was not only a reduced version of his name but also a religious one.
“ You are the most common word in the Bible, and that means ‘ you,’ ” according to West, “the title of his album was in one of the recent interviews with the radio executive Big Boy.
"Well, I am you, I am us.
First came Kanya, which means "one," and now I'm just Y, which is a reflection of all the good, the bad, the unintelligible things in us at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are."
He's not the first known rapper to choose to change his name.
Sean Kombs, formerly known as Paff Duddy, Pe Diddy, or simply Diddy, asked this year to call himself Lav (“love”) or Brasa Love Love Love Love (Bratt Love) Love.
He also changed his name several times with WestPper J-Z by writing his name: defis and no, capitalized or constructional.
President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military force against the civilian population
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico vowed never to use military force against the civilian population in the run-up to the fiftieth anniversary of the student demonstration that ended the bloody confrontation.
President López Obrador promised, on Saturday afternoon, that he would “never seek the help of the army to oppress the Mexican people”.
On this point, on October 2, 1968, the first crowd shot in a peaceful demonstration, and the 300 people killed, and it was against the backdrop of the expansion of the left student movements in Latin America.
Lopes Obrador also promised support to Mexican youth through a monthly scholarship for study and the opening of more free State universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of prospects for learning led young people into a criminal world.
US$ needs to double financing for IE development
China and its efforts in artificial intelligence (IIA) should not be underestimated — the United States should redouble its investments in its scientific developments, as Lee Kaifu, investor and enterprise development experience in I.I. with the work of Google, Microsoft and Apple believed.
Previous statements on IE work have been made by several American ministries, although in general the United States does not have a clear development strategy for the II.
At the same time, China submitted its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in innovation by 2030.
“A doubling of the budget for the II study would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we expect the next breakthrough in the II field,” says Lee.
The increase in funding can double the chances that the next great achievement of I.I will be made in the United States, said Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book The Superintendents of the Intelligent Intelligence: China, the Cold Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, general director of Sinavation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent II companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Mello, he was working on an artificial intelligence system that exceeded the highest game of American Otello, and then was led by Microsoft Research and the President of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Robotics Hallenge Agency Defense Advancing Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be held to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“It is not China that absorbs academic leaders, but corporations that are convinced by Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policies can also help the U.S. develop artificial intelligence.
“I think the cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State published a plan to develop the artificial intelligence of the next generation.
China ' s National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides scientists with funding similar to that of the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations providing money to United States researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, and Lee argues.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established the Joint Centre for Intelligent Intelligence, which should involve industry and academic partners, while the White House announced the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on Intelligent Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced $2 billion for the AI Next programme.
In the case of NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in IE studies.
However, U.S. legislation, which had sought to establish the National Security Commission on Intelligent Intelligence, had not taken any measures in that direction for several months.
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name.
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the name of their country should be changed to “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would permit a multi-year dispute with Greece, which had blocked its application for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is a province of Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbour to be a claim in its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on a new name proposal, but the opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign questioned whether the turnout would be 50 per cent minimum required for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to a treaty with Greece?”
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging after the break-up of Yugoslavia, should pay the price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, to be free to live under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us, ” relates Oliver Giorgievsky, a woman of 79 years old.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament stated that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although not legally binding.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority vote of members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1 a.m.
However, it was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for the sake of my children, our place in Europe”, says 62-year-old Yose Tanevski, a electorate from the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dosko, voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which would open the way for her to join NATO and the European Union in Stromuza, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Prior to the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small scene by placing chairs in front of tents set up by citizens who intend to boycott the referendum.
“We want to join NATO and the EU, but we want to join a high-level head rather than an arm of the officials’ offices,” says Kavarak.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-esteem.
If they do not wish to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would provide investment in Macedonia, which was so much needed in that country, where the unemployment rate was more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be over 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO, ” said Zaev after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “a guarantee to our prosperous future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia revealed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that was below the required appearance.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian channel Telecom-TV found that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of the total claimed to have voted positively.
In order for the referendum to take place, it must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the Western Government since it came to power last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City is protecting Briton to kill a nude.
Sergio Aguéro and Rahim Sterling have been killed with the protection of Briitton, leading to the victory of Manchester City on Saturday, Saturday, at Tsehad, Manchester, England.
When Aguero hit his goal at 65 minutes, it didn't seem like he had any trouble.
At the beginning of the episode, an Argentine attacker received a pass at the center of the field.
It swept through three Briton defence lawyers before entering the open space.
Aguero found herself surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one defender and held several others at the edge of the Briyton fine zone.
He then handed Sterling's ball to the left.
An English attacker, in one connection, returned Aguero's ball, which his right leg was hit by Matthew Ryan's Brayton altar at the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero has some problem with his feet,” declared the journalist, Mr. Manchester City, Pep Guardiolla.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky that he shot a leg at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Heavenly Blue the initial advantage in fighting the Prime League.
That leg was scored for 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguero got a ball deep inside Briton.
He's given a very good cut to the left flank on Leroy Sana.
Sana made a few concerns before giving Sterling a hand over to the far trouser.
The attacker, the sky and blue, killed the ball in the gate just before flying off the field.
Manchester City fought with Hoffenheim in the League of Champions group on Tuesday at 12:55 on the Rhine-Niccar-Arene in Zensheim, Germany.
Sheerser's going to pick points from the Colorado Rocky.
There was no special reason to force events after Washington Nashions had left the battle for the play-off.
But the inexorable Sherzer hopes to win the struggle against Colorado Rocky on Sunday, but only if the Rockies are ahead of the Los Angeles Downers game in the West December, problems in the Play-Off will begin.
On Friday night, at least 7 or 8 places had already been won by the Nisionals, but they were still hoping to be named in the first case.
“Even though we are playing just so, at least we can maintain our positions, knowing the enormous importance of the Denver atmosphere in the presence of the audience and another team, perhaps unprecedented this year.
How can I miss it?'
Nashionis has not yet announced a Thursday on Sunday, but, according to the latest evidence, the Scherzer is in a position to take this role.
Sherzer, going out for the 34th game, threw a ball at the pets' playground on Thursday, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he'll be the drinker.
The statistics on the Washington right-hand, 18-7, rated ERA 2.53 and 300 auts at 220,2/3 innings in the current season.
Trump run a pre-election race in West Virginia
Referring to the importance of Republicans appearing in the interim elections, the President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavano, a candidate nominated by the President to the Supreme Court.
“All we did was at the map in November.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, although I’m really running, fighting everywhere for good candidates, ” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible, radical group of democracies, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using whatever means are necessary, and we are watching corruption and hypocrisy.
They don't care who they're going to hurt who they have to go through to get power and control, and that's what they want to get -- power and control, but we're not going to give it to them."
The Democratics, he claims, were bent on “opposing and impeding”.
“And you have observed it in the last four days,” he said, calling the democracies “wicked, vile, phony and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee by referring to Senator Dainn Feinsstein, which caused loud publicity from the Hall.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow this document to leak?
Mmm... mmm... what document?
No, no, the language of the body has given it away, and I've never seen the tongue of the body so negating words like that."
The Labour Party is no longer an organization with differing views.
It does not tolerate those who speak.
When Momentum activists in my local party presented a proposal for a piece of mistrust to me, it was not a surprise.
In the end, I am the last member of Parliament from the Labour Party, who has not yet been told that we are not welcomed for expressing our opinion.
The same attitude toward my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, and Europe are ironically matters on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notification of the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the time, eight years ago, I served as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party, the nightly GC Friday meetings were like this.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not consistent with many meetings, and the promise of a “more human and soft” policy is long forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that there are no differences of views in the Labour Party is becoming increasingly clear, and each opinion is evaluated as to whether it is acceptable for party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own, began to expect me to radically change my views and positions that I would never agree with — whether national security or the single EU market.
Every time I make a public statement — and it is not important that I say that in social networks there is a choosing of insults calling for the abolition of elections condemning the policy of the centre or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And this isn't just happening to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments addressed to me still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who every day face the current of sexual or racist assaults, but never deviate.
What is most disappointing in this policy is that the number of insults has become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Labour Party must develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church” and, with every corner of confidence or change in the party's choice of choice, it is already coming.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations encouraging me to sit still and stop talking, and that's when I'm okay.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined the Leborists in 32 years ago, when I was a student of a school who resented the Government's neglect of Tätcher, which caused my school class to break down, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need it most — whether the work of the local deputy or the government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, nor have I done that in previous elections.
No one in Notting East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagreed with the current leadership.
On Friday, I would like to say to those who have supported this omen: our country is working so hard on Brexit, which is guaranteed to cause economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the only audience I'd like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, and my electors, whether they're liberalists or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to the abolition of the election results or political viability will prevent me from doing what I think is necessary in your best interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament from Nottingham District of East
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Poor Air comes first.
Two late attempts may have distorted the final outcome, but Air has no doubt earned the triumph of this amazingly interesting Prime Tennant match.
They are now headed by a table, the only inconsolable dozens team.
After all, it was because of their excellent protection and their ability to choose the right moment, which gave the team and coach Peter Merchi the right to be happy.
“All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still unsatisfied, so I have no reason to be sad, ” commented Peter Merchi.
Robin Cristie, Melrose: "Er pay tribute," they did better than we did."
The 14-minute attempt of Grant Anderson by Frasier Climo led the Air forward, but the yellow card released for the Worory game allowed the Scottish player Rory Hughes to move forward and Jason Baggott to catch up with an unreal attempt.
Climo increased the "Er" cut with a fine before a point in the middle of the game earned it, and then, in a break, made a lonely attempt, setting off 17-5 in favour of Air.
But the Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt at Baggot reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious trauma of Ruiard Knott, which was a stretch, and after a re-entry, the Air was further advanced owing to the efforts of Stafford McDawell, the Climo.
The acting captain, Blair McFerson, then received a yellow card, and again "Melrose" forced the rivals to pay another player for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt, at the end of a violent period of pressure.
However, the masters returned, and when Strawán Hutchinson received a yellow card to interrogate Climo without a ball with a line of fine, McFerson took a shoeboard behind the incoming mole of Air.
Clime took advantage of, without stopping almost from the re-entry, after Kyle Row had received a blow from David Armstrong and had sent the extreme attacker Gregor Henry to his fifth attempt to take over the fields.
From here on, Still Game is going to start a new career in the restaurant business.
From here on, Still Game Ford Kiran is going to start his work in the hotel industry: it was known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor serves as Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show that he's writing to, and he's filming with Greg Hemfield's old comedy partner.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last one in the show, and it looks like Kirnan's life is going to be planned after Craigng.
Officially, he is the director of the Adrichtmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the source of the Skottish Sun suggested that Kirnán was planning to participate in a “good restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our world”: Bolivia's landlocked hope that the Court will once again open the path to the Pacific Ocean
Seafarers patrol naval headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings have blue flags.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted by a slogan: "Our power is right.
It is our duty to return it."
Throughout Bolivia, landlocked Bolivia, there is still a memory of the coast line lost in favour of Chile as a result of the 19th century ' s bloody conflict because of resources; and a living and determined return to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been the boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia looks forward to the decision of the international court to be held on 1 October as a result of the five years of debate.
“ Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and a moral balance, and is certainly looking forward to a positive outcome, ” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal at The Hague will be able to support Bolivia ' s claim that after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of sovereign land to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is waging a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also looking forward to a solution to be delivered on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean”, he argued at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in Bolivia’s behalf, and if so, that would make little difference.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority over Chilean territory and has already stated that there will be no impact on the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the judgement of the International Court of Justice was delivered only six months after the last arguments were heard, shows that the case “was not a complex one,” says the Chilean expert on international law.
The case of Bolivia has not progressed in the past four years, but on the contrary, it has been postponed all the time.
“The foreign administration of Bolivia has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes”, says Zarata.
According to her, Morales’s military rhetoric destroyed the last Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but discussions will be extremely difficult thereafter.
These two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree that the court ' s decision had been delivered too quickly.
Monday will provide “an exceptional opportunity for Bolivia to begin a new era of relationship with Chile” and the opportunity to “put an end to 139 mutual benefit differences”, he argues.
Kalzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of the most popular Latin American Presidents, uses the naval problem as a political prize.
“Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific”, he argues.
“The decision of the court is an opportunity to see once again that we must move across our past.”
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place until it can trust the United States.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ry Young Ho, states that his country will never go to destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Saturday R spoke at a meeting of the United Nations Genoa.
He called on the United States to fulfil the commitments made at the Singapore summit between its leaders.
His comments are being received as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of the resumption of the impasse in nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Eun.
Ry claims: the dream that the long-term sanctions and the US ' s objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever put the North on its knees is a Utopia.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration unless Pyongyang takes significant steps on disarmament before it can be adopted.
And Kim and President Donald Trump of the United States want to hold the second summit.
But scepticism about the serious rejection of the national arsenal as the only way to guarantee its security is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Phanyan next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris ' s fashion shows show the newest line of massive head coverings that are promised to appear in the mass sale, and they will be carried right next to you.
If you want to add a hat to your collection or to protect yourself completely from sunlight, there is no need to look for something else.
The designers Valentino and Tom Browne presented a mass of unusual head coverings forming part of their SS19 collection and blinding visitors to the Model Week in Paris.
This summer's extremely practical hats won the popularity of Instagram's subscribers, and the designers decided to send their discovery to the podium.
An isolated copy of Valentino, the main beehives, decorated with broad plumage-like fields, sneaked on the head of the models.
Other massive axsaws included ornamented orbital stones, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple, but all these head coverings are not designed to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of fabled masks, which had to be very good on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these sandflakes had their mouths lit, and they were more like Hannibal Lector's portrait than the creation from the corner.
One was a piece of underwater water-floating equipment with tubes and protective cells, while the other was a loosed ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're lucky.
Well, powerful critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of mass sales — right to you.
Large-scale hats follow the fifths of La Bomba, a strawed hat with a two-foot wide coat that was put on by everyone, from Rianna to Emily Ratakovsky.
The ultimatum, which produced this extremely impractical hat that won so much popularity in social media networks, gave birth to and sent another huge axeoire — a strawed beach bag — almost as big as the model worn by the merchant himself.
The orange bag of a burned-out bivalve with a white leather handle and a locker in the locker was a vivid copy of Jacquemous La Rivira SS19 on the Model Week in Paris.
A villageist named Luke Armitage relates: “I think large hats and beach bags will be available in the following summer, and since the designer has done this for us in his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge exsessors.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to citizens of the world
The Scottish Independent Schools continue to be a tradition of brilliant education, as confirmed in 2018: the outstanding results of the examinations have shown individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other social and educational subjects.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 pupils are enrolled throughout Scotland, and seek to provide higher levels of services to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for continuing higher education, their career choices and the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of school choice.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, then you call to his understanding.
If you speak to him in his own tongue, you will turn to his heart.”
This is a compelling indication that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to have relations with citizens of other countries and to be able to trust them.
As a result of the recent examinations this year, we see the languages taking a leading position in the League tables and having the highest scores of exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students in foreign languages were highly estimated by A.
The data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of pupils had received “A” for Mandanese (Chinese); 72 per cent of students were German, 69 per cent French and 63 per cent Spanish students; and A received “A”.
This proves that foreign languages in Scottish independent schools are clearly considered vital to children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects are on the same footing as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the Commission on Employment and Skills of the United Kingdom in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill vacant jobs were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are thus increasingly the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that better jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession he chooses, if he learns the second language, in the future he will have a real advantage by learning another skill that will benefit him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives competitive advantages to a person who has several foreign languages.
According to a survey of YoGov, in which more than 4,000 adult British participated in 2013, 75 per cent failed to speak a language that was good enough to support conversation, and French became the only language with a two-digit, 15 per cent of the respondents.
That's why investing in language education is so relevant now.
The knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, would give children a better chance to find good jobs.
In Scottish schools, there is a wide variety of languages taught — each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools concentrate in more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be most important to the British in the light of the future development of the country by 2020 — such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, independent schools will always choose from several languages with a teaching staff whose members are specialists in those languages.
Scotland ' s independent schools seek to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of their future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages in the global business environment continue to be vital for the future development of the country, and should therefore be appropriately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must indeed be regarded as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, which ensures diversity and benefits for young people in Scotland.
Il faut boen le faire.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron debuts Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The Tomious expectation of fans to see Lebron James speak for the first time in Los Angeles Leykers is almost over.
Lakes coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the pre-face Sunday match against Dever Naggets in San Diego.
But there is still a need to find out how long it will have to be played.
“more than one and less than forty-eight,” replied Walton on the official Lakes website.
Lakers Reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to be playing a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-trial games in Lakes.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-trial games to prepare for the season, ” the player answers.
Pre-election Trump's Race to West Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of pre-election meetings this evening in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned meetings of Trump next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and Missouri.
Since the election on his nomination as Chief Justice was postponed, Trump seeks support in the upcoming interim elections, the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress if the vote is to take place in November.
How long will the Trumpa meeting in West Virginia be today, and how can you see it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wiling, West Virginia, will be held at 7 p.m. east, today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trumps meeting with West Virginia voters online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to take part in the hearings this week in order to appoint his candidate Bretta Kavano to the position of Chief Justice, and the proposal by Trump of this candidate has caused a mass of negative reactions, as Kavano was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote to be taken at the Senate will be postponed until the week the FBI conducts its investigation.
But the main goal of the campaign is to help republicans in the November elections build up their electoral pace.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign to ensure that these five meetings, to be held next week, will help to “activate volunteer and support activities, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives, ” writes Reuters.
“The Congress’s control is so important to its agenda that the President must visit as many states as possible, since we enter the tense season of pre-election agitation, ” relates Trump’s pre-election press secretary, who refused to be called Reuters.
The action planned today on Wesbanco Arena in Wiling can attract supporters from “Ogaio and Pennsylvania, and draw attention to the Pittsburg media, ” reports West Virginia Metro News.
A visit by the West Virginia Trump on this Saturday is the second visit to the state in the last month, which has been the advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is behind the polls.
“The fact that, in order for Morris to get ahead of competitive polls must come to see the President is a bad sign for Morris himself, ” says Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia (Reuters Citate).
Ryder's Cup 2018: The United States of America shows its commitment to fighting and gives hope by going out on a pair of contests on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, a two-to-two Saturday game may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
A transitional initiative is an exceptional, inventive sports concept, but it is the players who believe in it, and it is particularly vivid in such competitions.
So who has the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I believe this is a small initiative for us,” said Jordan Sveying.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and then 12 more on the horse.
According to Spaniards, they feel a "wetter in sails", and they have reason to keep their spirit high, not least because of the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and everybody can boast three glasses out of four.
You've been in a lot of trouble, from you to the hustle, than you've set a personal example.
The victory bells got louder as his round went on, pushing the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas fell two by two.
His blow to win their 15th hole game was met with a similar cry, one of those saying his belief in the chance for the American team.
“We need to get together with everything and focus only on our own games, ” commented Spaniard.
That's all that's left for the players.
Go 18 holes and become winners.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who have entered the story of the Cup of the Ryder.
A strange but charming couple from Europe got four out of four, and they don't seem to know the mistakes.
Molived was the only couple who didn't get the gods on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again Friday morning.
Such a series and the way in which their energy seems to circulate between them and the dysfunctional fans strengthens the belief that they will not be won on Sundays, and when the sun collapses behind the field Le Holf National, there will be no more famous player who has consolidated Europe's potential victory than Flytwood or Molinari.
It'd be nice if both of them were at the same time on different holes.
But speaking of the glory of Europe is still premature.
Bouba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly broke up with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball morning hero when he was married to Alex Noren.
The gods and the two double gods on the first nine holes dug a Spaniard and a Swedish boat from which they could never get out.
So on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
It is so exciting to watch four ball games and four player games because of the interaction between the couples they exchange and who deliberately slow down and how the strategy can change in a single moment.
So far Europe has played better than a team, and on the last day, but this session of four has also shown that the United States has every effort to fight in which some, particularly in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Cup of Ryder, Europe is leading 10-6
Europe will enjoy a tangible advantage on the final day of the Wyder Cup, after the Saturday matches are completed in four balls and four with the advantage of 10 to 6 over the United States.
The inspired duet, Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari, took the lead in fighting the two victory over the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the Le Holf National bill to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who wants to get back lost in Hazeltin two years ago by a trophie, dominated the U.S. team's making mistakes in their morning games by winning the 3-1 bill.
The United States had increased its resistance in the Quartet by winning two matches, but they were unable to bridge the gap in the account.
Jim Ferrica's team needs eight points out of the 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophies.
Flitwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname Mollywood after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair that won the four points in the first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
They broke Woods and Patrick Reed into four balls, and then they went on to join themselves in a great victory for the spirited Woods and the United States novel of Bryson Dechebmo with even more decisive 5/4.
Wood, who passed the two Saturday matches, showed periodic flashes, but now he lost 19 out of 29 balls in four balls, and four of them in seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who had been resting before the four-ball game in the morning, returned to the Quartet partner Henrik Stenston, defeating David Johnson and Brooks Keppka with 2/1 in the world's first and third-place partnership.
For Europe, playing has not been an easy and pleasant pleasure for a refreshing day towards the south-west of Paris.
Made by three times by Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points became a reference for Americans.
They won a decisive victory with 2/1 over the Spaniards by John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game, and then they went back to play Pauler and Rory Macillroy with 4/3 in their fours, losing the first two holes.
Only on two occasions in the story of Ryder's Cup, the team got out of the four-point period, leaving alone, given that it was necessary for the Ferica team, as masters, to play the dance to keep the trophies.
However, after two days of holding the second seat, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it's over the edge of their capabilities.
North Korea says that “substantially” will not be unilaterally disarmed without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea stated at the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions continued to increase mistrust of the United States and that his country would in no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ry Yong-Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “human goodwill measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear test sites and the commitment not to build nuclear weapons stockpiles or develop nuclear technology.
“One symmetrical reaction from the United States is not observed, ” he said.
“No trust in the United States will be assured of our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able unilaterally to take the first disarmament action.”
While Ri reiterated North Korean complaints about Washington's “phased” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it had not rejected a unilateral denuclearization without control, as Phanyan had done in the past.
Ry referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Eun and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the U.S. current President and the North Korean leader, which was held in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to begin to move towards the “denularization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to formally complete the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States states that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes calls for the weakening of the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“U.S. insists that the `favour must be denuclearized' and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force and even to object to the ‘war announcement,’ ” says R.
“The assumption that sanctions can put us on our knees is the utopian dream of people who don't know us.
But the real problem is that the continuing sanctions increase our mistrust.”
Ree did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Zhe Inno over the past five months and added: “If South Korea were a party to the issue of denuclearization, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been such a impasse.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ry's speech was quite different from that of last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea's target of missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after the "Mr. President of Evil" Trump called Kim a “saubic missile”.
This year at the UN Trump, which last year threatened to destroy the North Korea “fullly”, commended Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions must remain in force until the North Koreans disarm.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not specify any time limits for the process: “whether it takes two years, three years or five months is irrelevant”.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage the Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo spoke before the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The introduction of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and in a binding manner until we see a full, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006, seeking to block the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN Ghana Assembly in the halls and informed him that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not succeed.
In July, he left Pyongyang and said that progress had been made, but within hours of his visit, North Korea condemned him for the “Bundic Requirements”.
North Korea promised that at a meeting with Muna this month to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, should the United States, for its part, take appropriate measures.
He said that the “appropriate measures” he had mentioned were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as those aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest in special courses
A new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, helped all students to learn to sleep more and to fight the chauvinist culture of caffeine to keep awake “night travel”.
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Chasler, a dream medical professor at Harvard Medical School and a Brigham and Women's Hospital clinic, had developed a course that he thought was the first of his kind in the United States.
After its opening, he promoted the idea of introducing such a course by reporting on the effect of lack of sleep on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came to my door and said, ‘I'm sorry that I only learned about this now that I'm almost done learning.'
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — that surprised me, ” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, tells how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sports performance, as well as how it improves the overall feeling of a person.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce this course after it had been found that students were seriously in a lack of sleep during the school week.
It takes one hour and students do a number of interactive tasks.
In one section of the class, an image of a dorm room is proposed, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches, and books to see how each of these actions and substance — coffee, light, which causes a lack of sleep — affects the sporting results and how important it is to receive enough sleep each day.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The online mapping of the compass encourages the participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes do not change the behaviour of students at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know how any other person has the right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health,” added Professor Chasler.
He said that the false feeling of pride that a person could “exhale all night” was still quite widespread, and modern technology, as well as increasing pressure on students, meant that sleep deprivation became a problem.
According to him, a sufficient amount of sleep of good quality is a “separate weapon” of a student to cope with stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to fight too much weight, as underspout turns the brain into a hunger regime, making him constantly feel hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian, who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler develop a course by visiting one of his classes last year at Harvard's first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to disseminate this information throughout the company.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to undergo a similar training program before entering a competitive training institution.
Professor Chasler recommends that students install a alarm clock to warn people to go to bed and wake up, as well as that they remember the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and light emitting lamps, which disrupts human biomidity and leads to problems of inflammation.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Hall Menga triumphs over the Gerard team
The Rangers experienced a further sad retreat, as the naked Dolly Menga led Stephen Gerard's isolated team to an attack with a 1:0 account in Livingstone.
Ibroxe was hoping to win his first victory on his way out after winning at 4:1 in February in St. John'ston, but Harry Holt's team failed only the second time to defeat Gerard from 18 games as manager, leaving him on eight points behind, giving him an easy victory to the Hars team, the leaders of the Scottish Prime League.
Menga fell seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who had lost the spirit, did not seem to be going to level the bill.
While Rangers is now in sixth place, Livingston has risen to the third place, and Hibernian has only given up in relation to the relationship between the heads killed.
And Rangers may have additional problems after a line judge, Kalum Spence, has had to heal the wound on his head after a subject has been thrown out of the public sector.
Gerard made eight replacements on the team that went through the Air in the semi-final for the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, in turn, followed the same strategy of Libya 11, which increased the gap with Harts last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-equipped counter-attacks made in every step.
Rangers may have been led by a sword, but Livingston was ebbing out more when the ball hits them.
They were supposed to kill the nude in just two minutes, when Menga Scott Pittman stopped Allan McGreg, but a half-defense took advantage of the opportunity.
Kigan Jakobs carried out a fine strike against the captain of Craig Halquette, but his defense partner, Alan Litgo, was only able to send the ball towards the far trousers.
Rangers seized control, but in the last third, there seemed to be more hope than belief in their games.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he should have had a fine strike at the forty-fifth minute when Stephen Lowes and Stephen Lowes encountered, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not agree with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers only made two hits in the first time, but the former Ibroxe ravine, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassan Kubili's head, and Ovi Ejaria's weak blow.
Although the first head of Libya, killed at the 34th minute, may not have responded to the game, no one can deny that they deserve it solely by their own labor.
But again, Rangers couldn't handle Jacob's standard play.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave Scott Robinson's ball, trying hard to get the ball to Menga to finish.
Gerard began to act on a pause when he changed Coulibali to Ryan Kent, and this was almost immediately the result when the extreme paratrooper gave off the Path of Morelos, but Kelly, who was impressed with his line of interception.
But Livingston continued to involve visitors in the game they planned with the participation of Litgou and Halket, constantly making long transfers.
Holt's team tried to step up the gap in the final stages, but McGreg was able to block Jacobs before Litgo gave a turn to the fields.
The hostage player Rangers, Glenn Middlton, again demanded a fine blow after he faced Jacobs, but Thomson again refused.
Almanac: Geiger 's inventor
And now the page of our almanac “Early Morning” is: on September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm Ghaeger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually created the device known as the Geiger counter.
As one of the bases of science, the Geiger counter also became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film "Coloco Coronado," with cowboy-like role models Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — such as do not look like scientists — in the main roles:
Man: "What kind of thing is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that are caused by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "This is right now!"
Ghan Geiger died in 1945, but only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see abnormal cells
A new missile vaccine can train and kill immune systems to “see” abnormally growing cells
Part of the vaccine treatment is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and to modify them in laboratory conditions.
As a result of this cell change, the ability to “see” the protein type common to many cancers is obtained and then the cells must be reborn by 0
A test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One patient who was admitted to the vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize abnormal cells has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and to modify them in the laboratory conditions, after which modified cells can “see” HER2 proteins specific to many different types of cancer, and then the modified cells are reentered by the patient.
Professor J. Berzoffski, National Cancer Research Institute, Bethlehem, Maryland, states: "The results we're getting are said to have, we have a very promising vaccine."
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “consumes the growth of several types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and colossal cancer.
A similar method has been successfully applied to leukemia treatment, and it has been used to take immunized cells from patients and their “learning” as to how cancer cells should be affected.
Kanje West spoke in defense of Trump's cap of MAGA after being in SPL.
It all went bad.
Kanje West was filmed during a Saturday concert, at which he spoke in favor of United States President Donald Trump, claiming that he would reoccur in 2020.
After the third song, entitled The City Ghost, he made the hat "Let's make America the Great Again", he delivered a speech against the democracies and supported Trump.
"That's how often I'm talking to white people, and they're asking me, "How can you keep Trump and he's racist?"
Well, if I had been concerned with the issues of racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” the perpetrator said.
SNL made a parody show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Bretta Cavano's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on the sexual harassment statements of Christine Blaise Ford.
Television did not show how the crowd resented West’s comments, but the video was uploaded to social media sites by Chris Rock.
It is not clear now whether Rock was trying to mock West this step.
West also complained to the public that his cap had been ridiculed behind the scenes.
"They were snitching at me behind the stage.
They say don't come out of this cap.
They really fucked up on me!
Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, "And they also said my position is not cool."
West continues: “Do you want to know that the world is not cool?”
Then you will need love."
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, the members of the actuary SNL seemed to be confused, and a man said to the publication, “All the studio was in silence”.
The West was invited at the last moment as a substitute for Arian Grande's singer whose ex-boyfriend, Raper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
A lot of people have wondered about West's "I Love it" song in a perrier's suit.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Kendice Turner, who wrote in Twitter: “One of the boldest people: MONIZY MADE MADE MADE MADE SERVING”
Karen Hunter, head of the show show, wrote on Twitter that West was just "the ones who are, and that's absolutely great."
“But I do not want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing, or otherwise supporting his creation) who, in my view, shares and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
As we are,” she said.
Before the show, the rapper announced at Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now “formly known as Kanye West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and go through the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Paff Duddy, Paffy and P.D.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Doga, originally named Snoop Lyon, and, as a second example, of course, a recent legend perpetrator, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist known as the Prince.
Attempted murder on the grounds of payoff at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds on Friday in a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
The incident occurred in Ballichaquara, reportedly in police custody.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
Kit Harington's "Capital Games" attackes toxic masking
Keith Harington is known for his role as the sword-blowing John Snow in the brutal medieval HBO starship series of the Game of the thrones.
Nevertheless, recently 31-year-old actor passionately criticized the Mascho stereotype, saying that such characters often suggest to young people that you have to be cruel if you are to be respected.
In his interview, The Sunday Times Culture of Keith said that he thought something went wrong, and wondered how to solve the toxic masking problem of the #MeTo age.
Keith, who recently married her colleague at the Cages Game, Rose Leslie, his youth, admitted that he was “all unequaled” to the problem.
“It is very important to me to take this question seriously: Where are we wrong about the perception of courage? ” asks the actor.
"Why do we teach teenagers that we have such a problem to date?"
Keith believes that television can be partly attributable to this upsurge of toxic courage because of too musculated characters.
The actor continues: “What is born and what is acquired?
What do they teach on TV and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they have to show only one aspect of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because today with young people, it's really something's wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any of the docks or skates of the throne game after the show ended in the following summer, stating that he had “endled with the Baals and horses”.
Since November, Kit has played a major role in the newly re-enacted "The Truth West" by Sam Shephard, who talks about the film producer and his brother, the robber.
Acter recently announced that he believed that meeting Rose's wife was the best final of the Games for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and life,” the actor says.
Rose played Igrist, an object of passion for the character of Kit John Snow in the Phentesine series awarded by Emma.
The couple celebrated the wedding in June 2018 at the family - name site of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14 per cent in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, there are more than 820,000 people who suffer from these diseases.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, indicating a shift in trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV infections in this way has almost been reduced to zero, and Chinese health representatives declared at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission is a serious problem in China ' s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is still widespread.
Studies confirm that, because of the country ' s conservative values, 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
In many cases, the transmission of disease is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to drugs against HIV as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters refutes information about the diversion of information on the guilt of Republican party senators, complaining for “safe lie” and “conspiracy theory”
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. Parliament on Saturday, rejected allegations that one of her staff had posted personal information to three U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the claims were faked by “ultralyright” experts and websites.
"Lie, lie, and even more lying," states Waters on his Twitter.
It is reported that the information published includes U.S. senator's home addresses and phone numbers, Lindsay Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hetch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during a hearing before a Senate commission on charges of sexual harassment brought against a candidate before the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano.
The flight took place some time after the three senators conducted their interrogation of Kavano.
Conservative sites, such as the Getaway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identified the source of the message had been linked to the office of Waters and reported on the staff of Waters, reported Hill.
“This unfounded allegation is totally false,” assures Waters.
“According to my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions, there was no responsibility in any way for leaking this information.
This unfounded allegation is a complete lie.”
Waterers immediately criticized the Internet, including by the former White House Spokesperson, Ari Fleyscher.
“This is angry denial, ” writes Fleascher.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for the Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why should you be angry?
You don't have to justify yourself either.
Nor should we dig in the motives of the prosecutors.
We must remain calm and cold."
Fleascher seemed to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of democracies against Judge Kavano, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for Waters in an interim election, also made his mind on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very important," he says.
In her statement, Waters states that her office warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these frauds.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are found,” she writes,“ and that they bear legal responsibility for all their actions that can be destructive and dangerous to all and to each of my staff”.
Johnny Ingly hits again — a weak parody on the spy Royn Atkinson
Today, it is a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which Britain appears in one way or another; this also applies to the new parody of the spying of the Agenta Johnny Inglis, which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film Agent Johnny Inglis: Overload.
Will the self-responsible image of the leitmotive be “seemly we're all the shit” of a new national export attempt?
In any case, the beaming of Johnny Inglix with a rubber face was given its right to chaos for the second time — his name alludes to his being a broad-screen comic piece intended for a non-English film audience.
Hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his enormity of glamorous claims, received a little Clouseau, the figures of Mr. Bin, and this guy's breakup, who made one single note to the Charotts of Fire in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveller and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played in the forgotten TV commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves behind him complete chaos.
This latest issue of JE has one or two pleasant moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Ingly came up to a medieval helicopter, and the lotts lay down his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift of physical exercise in comedy scenes, but the humour itself seems rather weak and oddly excessive, especially because such "serious" movies as Agent 007 and the Mission is not complete are now strongly proposed by the comedy as an element.
It's such a feeling that humor is meant for children, not adults, and for me, the enormity of Johnny Inglossa's abuse is not as resourceful and relevant as Atkinson's scrawlings in Mr. Bine's films.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has entered the top secret spy network of Britain, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, and to the horror of the duty agent, Kevin Eldon, here, unfortunately, has come an episodic role.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, an obsessive and obsessive figure already suffering from massive political dislocation: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the character of Kwazi-Treza-May, but there's nothing in the script to work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since each active spy has been compromised, she will have to remove someone from her resignation.
And here it's Johnnie Ingly for his own person, who's now working as a school teacher in a vintage institution, but also provides informal secret operating lessons: there's some good jokes here, because Ingly offers the skills of a "year" spy academy.
Inglis return to Whitehall for emergency training and be reunited with his former unpleasing buddy Baf, whom Ben Miller is playing this time.
Baf is now a married man under the commanding officer of a submarine, the role of “fun hockey hookers, ” where Vicki Pepperdin is a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game because they have made terrible mistakes in her Majesty's Secret Service, and they're faced with a beautiful rock woman, Ofelia Ballet, in the work of Olga Curielenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister has fallen dangerously under the spell of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems — the angry Jason Volt, who is played by Jake Lacey.
Inglis and Baf start their fart jokes: disguised under waitress, they set fire to a French restaurant; they set up a chaos, smuggling themselves into a luxurious Volta yacht; Ingli produces complete anarchy, trying to use a virtual reality garrison to find out about the interior of Volta's house.
All these scenes, of course, are nice and out of line, but there's something very childish about it.
Full of moderate things.
And, as with other films by Johnny Inglish, I couldn't help but think, can the British film industry really not give Rowan Atkins a role, really commensurate with his talent?
Leiborists deny that they are drawing up a plan to reduce the working week of British people to four days for five days' wages.
The Leborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, is going to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week but will be paid in five days.
The Party is reported to wish that company managers would give workers savings from the artificial intelligence revolution an additional weekend.
This would allow staff members to enjoy three days of rest for the same wage.
Sources reported that the idea was “incorporated” on the party's economic agenda and would help the people to take sides with the workers.
The Trade Union Congress has approved a four-day transition so that workers can benefit from a changing economy.
A high source of the Labour Party said The Sunday Times: It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work-week is our goal, which corresponds to the party's approach to changing the economy's balance in favour of workers, as well as to the party's overall industrial strategy.”
The Leiborist Party is not the first to support this idea, since the Green Party has promised four days of work as long as it has a pre-election campaign in 2017.
However, that desire is currently not approved by the majority of the Labour Party.
The representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party”.
The Tenet Chancellor John McDonnell used the Leborough Conference last week to specify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was committed to deposing power from the `discipline directors' and `listers' of utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current water channel shareholders might not be able to recover their entire share, as the Labour Government could make a "recruit" on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the board of directors and to set up Inclusive Owenership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of the capital of private sector firms to workers who can receive an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 minutes' whether the FBI's investigation of Cavanano can change their views
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Britta Kavano has held a final vote on his appointment as Chief Justice for at least a week and raises the question of whether the findings of an agency can induce any of the Republican senators to support Kawano.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, a 60-minute correspondent, interviewed Republic Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, or the FBI can find anything that will make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course, ” Kennedy replied.
“When I went to the meeting, I said I was talking to Judge Kavano.
I called him after this happened, when I got the information, I said, "Did you do that?"
His answer was decisive, definite and unequivocal.”
But the position of Graham in the vote remains unresolved.
“I have made a firm determination regarding Britta Kavano, and my opinion can only be changed by argument, but by force it is comparable, unless it is against the dynamics,” he said.
“Doc Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing I know is, Brett firmly denied all of this, ” added Graham, turning to Christine Blaise Ford.
“None of those whom she called as witnesses could either confirm these facts.
That story has been going on for 36 years.
I didn't notice anything new in it."
What was Global Citizen Festival and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
There will be a Global Citrene Festival in New York on this Saturday, an annual music event in which an impressive star composition with no less impressive mission is involved — an end to poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year, as tens of thousands of people in the World ' s Citizens Festival, there is a large lawn in the Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performance of performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, and to highlight the present objective: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the global poverty reduction project carried out by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty, increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), you have to be involved in volunteering or send an electronic letter to the world leader, make a telephone call or take any other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the Festival of World Citizens in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is it really the idea of remuneration for people to attend concerts free of charge to persuade fellow citizens to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "terrorism," where people believe that they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
Global Citizen’s organizers claim that, since 2011, more than 19 million “acts” carried out by its supporters have been registered in the festival.
It is recalled that this action promised world leaders a commitment of more than $37 billion, which should have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group presented 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimated that nearly 649 million people around the world had received direct assistance from funds.
One of the most significant commitments is the The Power of the North: the British partnership of investors and implementation experts committed to “helping children fully to discover their potential”, pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the district, after receiving more than 4,700 tts from Global Cities.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national Governments and Global Cities, such as you, we can do social injustice against the lack of food of the past history,” said Ambassador Power of National Tresy Ulman at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to encourage the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Food Power Project, which would reach 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival's website, why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global crime’s organizers say, “It will be a long and difficult road on which we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But as in the major struggle for civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Jeanel Mone are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, with Deborra Lee Fernness and Hugh Jackman taking the lead.
The US can use the Navy to prevent Russian energy exports: the Minister of the Interior
The U.S. Home Secretary, Ryan Zinke, stated that Washington could “if necessary” use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia ' s presence in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to study new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are some ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of maritime routes and, if necessary, the blockade so that their energy does not enter the market,” said the Minister.
Zinki addressed the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that described itself as “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He then compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were in fact identical.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less effective use and substitution of fuel,” said the Minister, calling Russia “one-time time, whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements were made because the Trump Administration had undertaken to increase the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this purpose, the Trump Administration, including President Donald Trump of the United States, has tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” project of the “Northern Stream2” pipeline, which, according to Trumpa, made Berlin a “Ploter” of Moscow.
In Moscow, it has been stressed on several occasions that the “North Flow-2” project, valued at $11 billion, should double the existing flow capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's violent resistance to this project is for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Nowak after meeting with the U.S. Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative response by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industry, through the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes in our supply of energy, it creates a serious problem,” said Diter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), following the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Senator, Massachusetts, Elisabeth Warren, will carefully explore the possibilities of running for the presidency in 2020
The Senator of Massachusetts, Elisabeth Warren, stated on Saturday that he would carefully explore the possibilities of running for the presidency following the mid-election.
In a meeting of the city duma in Holioque, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking of participating in the electoral race.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and start our broken government, and for that to happen, a woman needs to be at the top,” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I shall give careful consideration to the possibility of running for Presidents.”
Warren expressed his appreciation for President Donald Trump's work during the meeting: “to lead this district in the wrong direction”.
“I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, ” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both the Trump and his candidate for the post of Chief Justice Brett Cavana.
In his Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before we turn to the vote.”
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters did not think that it should be running in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Centre for Political Studies of the University of Saffolka/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of Massachusetts's "viral" voters stated that the senator should not be running.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the other hand, support its plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Dewal Patrica: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other well-known names of the democracies that were discussed in connection with the 2020 vision include former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Bayden says he'll take an official decision for January, reports Associated Press.
Sara Payin spoke of the post-traumatic stress disorder of Traka Peylin in a meeting with the voters of Donald Trump
Trek Payin, aged 26, joined the army in September, spending a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening
“My son, who returned home, is now in the same condition as members of other families who have suffered the consequences of PTSD and who have been injured, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Peylin called his arrest “blah on the eye” and said of her son and other war veterans:“They are returning to others, who are killed, wondering whether the same respect for their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military force they have given to their country.”
Traik Peylin was arrested on Mondays in Vasille, Alaska, and charged with family violence against a woman who interfered with the situation of violence and possession of weapons in alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasill Police Department.
18 states, D.C., supporting the challenge of the new asylum policy
The eighteen states and districts of Colombia support the legal challenge of the new U.S. policy, which prohibits the provision of asylum to victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives from 18 states and districts filed an analytical note by a court consultant on support of an asylum-seeker challenging policy on Friday.
The complainant's full name, "Graze v. Sessions", filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics, is undisclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband, “and his sons of criminal group”, abused her, but on 20 July the U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys in the Greys indicate that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are receiving large numbers of asylum applications in the United States as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum.
The Attorney-General of the District of Colombia, Carl Rusin, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “has ignored decades of the application of State, federal and international law”.
“The Federal Law requires that all applications for asylum be examined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle”, states a court adviser.
Counsel also claims that the policy prohibiting immigration is detrimental to the U.S. economy, stressing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “to provide for the necessary labour”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Seshns ordered that immigration judges no longer provide safe haven to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“Escape will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political belief,” said Seshns in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious problems that people face every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palau: the number of deaths doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more difficult.
"It's very difficult now," says a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick baby at the evacuation centre of the destroyed city of Palau.
“Every minute, ambulance brings the wounded.
Net water is in great deficit.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig in wet things and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals affected by the 7.5 earthquake are overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including the Days of Harris, who had a back and shoulder fractured, were resting outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated in the open air because they had to leave the room because they were still being used in strong numbers.
He cries as he remembers that the earthquake destroyed the room in the hotel on the fifth floor, which he filmed with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I've been squeezed into the cracks of the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“ I heard my wife cry out for help, and then I came in silence.
I don't know what happened to her and to our kid.
I hope they're saved and they're all right now."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “insurrections” through “advertising”
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ads daily in the United States on the mutual benefits of US and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to promote propaganda.
President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to a pay supplement to the Dés Mains Register of China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa, with charges against China in an attempt to interfere with the 6 November U.S. Congress, which China denied.
The charge of Trump that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections is proof of what U.S. officials told Reuters: a new stage is emerging in Washington's increasing pressure campaign against China.
While foreign Governments are the norm for advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are in the process of escalating trade war, which makes them equal to import tariffs for their countries.
China ' s responsible tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to target exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republic of Trumpa Party, and declared Chinese and American experts.
Terry Brandstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term Governor of Iowa, a large agricultural exporter to China, claims that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and business.
China, in an article published in the Sunday’s Dass Moines Register, “is now doubling this pot by posting propaganda in our own free press.”
“In promoting its propaganda, the Chinese Government uses the American tradition of freedom of speech and free press dear to our hearts, paying for and placing at the Des Mains Register,” writes Brunstad.
“You will hardly hear dissenting voices and will not see the true diversity of opinions that the Chinese can learn from China’s alarming economic policy, as local media are under the strict control of China’s Communist Party, ” he says.
He also added that one of the most well-known Chinese newspapers had “clarified” the invitation to publish its article, although it did not include the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: by Cavanano, the Republicans are being pushed away by women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to remain on the sidelines and defend the candidature of Chief Justice Britta Kavano despite several allegations of sexual violence, while analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially on the part of women, that may affect the upcoming interim elections.
Emotions around this situation have broken to extremes, and most Republicans have officially declared that they want to continue voting.
It is not possible to return to such things later, ” writes Grant Rier, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, at Siracusa University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arorna) to investigate the FBI at the very last minute will be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget it either tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the Progressive Group MoveOn The Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors scandalated “Near fronts!” across the Senate, when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to stand for Cavanano, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaisi Ford, reported Mic.
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the boundaries, ” declared the news site of St. Rotenberg, a non-partisan politician.
“People are saying that the situation has already come to a head, and that's true.
But it can get worse, especially for women voters in the suburbs and young voters, between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often don't vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the post of Chief Justice, accused of sexual harassment, analysts assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the announcement, that step could lead to a response.
“This is a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee in early last week, as NBC News reports.
“The decision is not only to vote in a committee or a final vote or to say whether Cavanano sat on a docket of the defendants, but also to the Republicans how it is handled,” says Guy Cecil, Director of tootations USA, a group that helps to elect democracies, a news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have divided a few points on the question of who they believe — Ford or Kavano — and almost the same is true of the latter.
A new yoGov survey showed that 41 per cent of respondents were exactly or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they were sure or likely to believe Kavano.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kavano is likely to have lied while giving his testimony, while only 30 per cent have said the same about Ford.
According to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, and at least another prosecutor — Deborah Ramírez — reports The Guardian.
Last week Ford vowed before the Senate Legal Committee that Kavano had attacked her when she was 17.
Ramírez claims that the Supreme Judge's candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Li, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee Solid open platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to access.
In an exclusive interview with Last Company Berners-Li, it was a joke that the purpose of Inrupt was to gain “world domination”.
“We must do this now”, he says of his startup.
“It's a historic moment.”
The annex uses Solid technology, which enables people to build their own “personal online data warehouses” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, cases as well as calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools for data management.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spoty -- everything can be used in one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data repository is that it is entirely managed by the user, who can have access to any necessary information.
It refers to this principle as “personal empowerment through data”.
According to John Bruce’s Director General, Inrupt’s idea was that the company provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
Currently, the company is Berners-Lie, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, several full-time developers contracted and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Li said that he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether his companies should make fundamental changes that would make all their business models completely different at the same time.
“We do not ask their permission.”
In his post at Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that “Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Li converted the Internet by creating a consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The voice of Berners-Li in recent months has been quite influential in the debate about network neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the consortium of the World Wide Web, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next Internet era,” says Berners-Li.
Bernard Vann: Church servant on Victorian cross during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one warrior priest was threatened with Victoria's cross during World War I, a event that was observed in his hometown 100 years later.
The Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vane, was awarded this reward on 29 September 1918 for participating in the attack on Bellegles and Löucour.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later without ever learning that he had received a high British military reward.
A monument to the occasion was inaugurated by his two grandchildren on the parade in Ruschden, Northhamptonshire, Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vane, said that it was “very symbolic”, that the monument had been opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the prize.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vane conducted his battalion through the San Canton Canal “in very dense fog and under strong fire from the field guns and machine guns”.
He later set himself up on the line of fire and led the group forward with the greatest courage and then, with one hand, threw a field gun, hit three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vane was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
A 72-year-old hero's grandson, Michael Vane, said that “he could hardly have done the same heroically, but it is dying”.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vane, also staged a parade at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Vane said that “it is an honour for him to participate in the parade” and added that “the beauty of the true hero is the support that will be given to many people”.
MMA worshipers didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they were shown Pepp's lead
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to watch the complete Bellator 206, but you were not allowed to see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 combats, including six major fighting forces, and the fighting was broadcast all night on 5 British television channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Hegard Musa and Rory McDonald prepared for the meeting, the fans of the UK were brightened to see Pepp's lead screens.
Some fans were not impressed, because they didn't sleep until morning precisely to watch the battles.
One Twitter fan described this change as a “dangerous joke” to a children's cartoon.
“It was decided that for six o’clock in the morning the content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to child programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of the Bellator Marketing and Communications, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, "Pepp's Lead."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said that they planned to make a schedule so that future fighting could also be seen from Britain.
“With regard to re-showing, I think we can resolve this issue,” says Coker.
“But it's Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we won't be able to resolve this issue until Sunday after our time, and for them it's Monday.
But we'll do our best.
Trust me, when the broadcast was changed, a pile of text messages was hung, and all of them were far from friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, and we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
Turns out no, it was a matter of state importance.
I promise you this will not happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of troops to five instead of six, as we normally do, and for fans we're trying to increase that number, but we're in a match.
Indeed, it is not a good thing."
Disert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt incomplete because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic diver Tom Daily says he's growing up feeling worse than anyone because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him motivation to be successful.
A 24-year-old athlete told me that he did not understand that “all are not like him” until he went to secondary school.
Addressing the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs programme, led by Lauren Laver, he said that he was thinking about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that the victory in the Olympics was less disturbing after he had a child.
The permanent leading multi-year Kirst Young show took several months ' leave because of illness.
Dailyly, speaking as the main guest in Laverna, said that she felt “less than anyone else” because her sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both boys and girls.
He relates: “To this day, these feelings of worthlessness and incomprehensibility were real, but they gave me strength, and I was successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something ” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned of his sexual orientation.
A two-year bronze Olympic medicalist became a prominent LGBT activist and, in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, urged countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had expressed his opinion because he was fortunate that he had been able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others the “hope”.
A third champion of the world said that his feelings for a man, American director David Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, were “not open to him”.
In the last year, Dale married Oscar, who is 20 years older than he is, but claims that the difference was never a problem.
“If so many things happen in your life at that young age”, he went to his first Olympic at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, and it was hard to find a peer with the same radical life experience.
A couple became parents in June, had a son named Robert Ray Black-Dailey, and Dale said that “all his views” had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, that would be all about "I need to win a gold medal," says the athlete.
“But you know what, there are some things, and the most important gold medals of the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011.
Daley told me that his father didn't want to accept what he was dying, and one of his last requests was to go to London 2012 first line.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Pop, you won’t be around, and you won’t be able to sit there in the front row,’ ” Dale says.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he wasn’t invincible, ” says the athlete.
Next year Dalee participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life — to dive in front of the crowd of compatriots at the Olympics and to feel no better, ” he says.
It also inspired him to choose the first favorite song — Proud by Others Small — that helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes him so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 in English summer.
Micelson, who's not in shape, spent this Saturday's Ryder Cup on the bench.
American Phil Mickelson will set the record on Sunday by playing his 47th match on Ryder, but he'll have to push his uniform to avoid a bad milestone.
Mikelson, who played the binnal on the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furick to the bench on Saturday for four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the heart of events, as was often the case in the United States, a five-fold major winner divided his day between playing and working on his own game on the field, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
Never with the most direct blow, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete is not the ideal candidate for the Le Holf National Road, where a long rap is usually punished for impregnable strikes.
And if the course itself is not quite frightening, Micelson, at the ninth match on Sunday, will meet the exact championship of British Open Francisco Molinari, who teamed up with Tommy Flitwood's new partner to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12th and the 1st games would make the fair start, Michaelson's match might be decisive.
Feric expressed confidence in his partner, though he could say something else.
“He fully understood the role entrusted to him today, shook me on my back, hugged me, and said that tomorrow would be ready,” Ferrick commented.
“He's pretty sure about himself.
He's walking the Hall of glory, and he's done so much for these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He desires to be there with all."
On Sunday, Michaelson beats Nick Fold's record with a match in the Wyder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cube, which never met the heights of its individual record.
Micelson has 18 wins, 20 injuries, and seven others, although Ferik said that his presence had been of considerable benefit to the team.
"He's funny, he's hot, he's smart, he likes teaching people, and he's a great guy with whom he's interested," he explained.
“I think young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see him.
His game is much more than a game."
Captain Thomas Björn of the European team knows that great advantages can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjørn, a captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant single-level leadership in the Kuba Ryder can easily turn against the other side.
Dotchanan debuted in 1997 in Valderram, where a team led by Northiano Ballesteros had five points over Americans, but had to overcome the finish line just a little bit ahead of the least difference by winning an account of 141 - 2 - 131 - 131 - 2
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and Valderram where we won, but just for the moment," said Björn, photographed after class was seen in 2018, winning the 5-3 box on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in an account of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and to the entire team that it's not over yet.
You'll be on your way back tomorrow.
Go and do all right.
As long as the points are not displayed on the panel, it's not over.
We have a goal, a chance to win trophies, and that's what we need to focus on.
I said not silent, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we know so well that what we are against is against the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied by the way his players took advantage of a golf field for them, Björn added: “I would never have done it.
There's another test waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual presentations are starting tomorrow, and that's another matter.
It's always nice to be with your partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're having all your powers of professional golf.
That is the kind of thought that should be used to inspire the players so that tomorrow can be put to full use.
Now the partner remains behind, and he must make every effort too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferick, believes that his players will be better off individually than his partners, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Ferik himself went through the whole of this past day, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe spent the Chodo in the Middle.
“I remember every fucking word about it,” he said in reply to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, joined together his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to be more quick to finish this than you did in Brooklyn, like in Media.
When the initiative moves one way, it exerts a lot of pressure on the match in the middle.
We set up our plan for the game and set up the children the way we thought was right, you know, tomorrow we're going to try to create a miracle."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting with Rory McMilro at the top of the top of the page with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Aian Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I chose this type of group of guys, and in this order, because I think they're going to cover up all the possible shortcomings, ” said Bjorn, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The introduction of a new German warship has been postponed again
The German fleet’s newer frigate was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the aged warships of the cold war era, but this will not occur at least next year due to poor systems and high cost rates, reports the local media.
The entry into service of the Lineland-Faltz, the main vessel of the totally new Bahts class of Baden-Württemberg, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, referring to the military representative.
The ship was to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the old frigates of the Bremen class.
As we know, they will have a powerful gun, numerous anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some “stables” technologies — such as reduced radar, infrared and accelerative signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods, which should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
Nevertheless, the continuous suspension of entry does mean that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will become obsolete by the time they take up arms, notes Die Zeit.
An evil frigate, F125, appeared in news headlines last year, when the German Navy formally refused to enter the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned the ship to the vessel after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects” that rendered a military ship useless when used in combat.
The shortage of software was particularly critical, as the Baden-Württemberg class vessels would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half the labour force on the old Bremen frigates.
It also turns out that the ship is too heavy to reduce its productivity and limit the ability of the Navy to implement future updates.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton-long Rainland-Pphaltz is twice the heavy ships of the same class that were used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also a problem.
It is said to have reached $3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) compared with the original Euro2.2 billion.
The retention problems of the newest frigats are particularly important in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defense Committee, acknowledged that the Navy actually “is about to complete the deployment of ships”.
The teacher said that the problem had grown worse over time because the old ships had been removed from service, but no vessels had been replaced.
He visited that none of the Bhaden-Württemberg frigats had ever been able to be taken up by the fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flying Mouses
A new study conducted in one of Scotland’s hills is designed to show how bats use landscapes in search of food.
It is hoped that the data received will allow for a new look at the behaviour of unique winged mammals and help to further preserve the species.
A study organized by scientists at the Scottish National Foundation will examine conventional non-toners, soprano nonstops, as well as brown, long-skilled, long-skilled, dobanton nighttime mice from Invrey Gardens and Western Ross.
Special registers will be installed at some locations around the location to monitor the effects of flying mice during the entire season.
The NHS and volunteer staff will also conduct mobile ground surveys using hand detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the records will determine the frequency of the covers as well as the activities for which the different groups of these animals are responsible.
A habitat map will then be developed and a report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Adviser to NTS, hopes that these results will show what habitats are most important for flying mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas for the management of habitats, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways of maintaining forest masses that are optimal for bats and other related species.
The population of flying mice in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the last century.
They are at risk of extinction because of the construction and Hellenic work that affects their habitat and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can pose a danger, as well as glue tapes for flies, chemical handling of building materials and house cat hunting.
Actually, flying mice are not blind.
However, their night - hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to mining.
They use sophisticated echoing equipment to accurately identify the obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the population of bats.
The organization has 10 trained experts who conduct regular interviews, exit checks and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave station in Damfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of Scottish bat species live.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says that the name is ideal for them.
"Here in Threave, a great place for flying mice," he said.
“There are old buildings here, many old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But much remains unknown about flying mice, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need for a prosperous existence.”
He recalled the importance of checking that there were flying mice prior to maintenance within the private domain, as the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young persons and perhaps even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Wet mice are protected by law, their destruction, the destruction or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrelli, a Scottish bat conservation fund officer, appeals to the public for help.
She says: “We have a lot to learn about our flying mice, and we just don't know how many distinct species live.
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape and his lawyers are going to su on a German magazine
Krishtian Ronald denies the charges of rape against him, calling them "fee news," and claiming that people simply want to be heard using his name.
His lawyers are about to su on the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published charges against football.
Forvard Portugal and Yuwentus were accused of rapeing an American girl named Catherine Myorg, who was allegedly in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, to report on Friday, “Hingel”.
Speaking on Instagram's video of 142 million subscribers to football, some hours after the charges were reported, Ronaldo, 33-year-old, referred to this information as “peasant news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all the fairy news, says a five-fold Balon d'Or winner on camera.
"They just want to make sure they use my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, to say my name, but it's only part of their work.
I am a happy person, and I’m doing great, ’ adds a smile athlete.
Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to sue for the charges that they call “unacceptable information on suspicions of confidentiality”, according to Reuters.
Cristian Scherz's lawyer stated that the player intends to claim compensation for “moral damage commensurate with the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It is alleged that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Myorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an anal form, according to the documents before the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorg claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on her lap and told her that he was a “99% good guy, but a single percentage.”
The documents say Ronaldu confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “fear that she would be punished” and feared“public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her place of residence because she continued to experience the trauma caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he entered the Italian Huve giants in a deal of Euro100 million.
Brexit: Great Britain “will regret car manufacturers lost forever”
The Minister of Business and Enterprises, Greg Clarke, stated that Britain “will regret this forever” if, after Brexit loses his world leader status in the area of car production.
He also commented on information that Toyota UK had informed BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a transaction, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernadette, near Derby.
“We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could lead to job loss.
Bernaston ' s plant produces Toyopa Auris and Avenue, and last year it released nearly 150,000 cars, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will be stopped at our plant,” says Marvin Cook, Managing Director, Toyampa, Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Great Britain expressed concern about leaving the EU without international trade agreements, including on Hunda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close the Mini production plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to car manufacturers, in the absence of a Brexit supply chain transaction, there will be a high risk of exposure.
The Toy kppp production line is launched “at the exact time” and the parts for the ordering vehicles are delivered by suppliers of Great Britain and the EU every 37 minutes.
If Britain leaves the EU on 29 March without a transaction, there may be disruptions at the border, which, according to industry, may result in delays and lack of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyopa will not be able to store stocks at her factory in Derbyshire for one day, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU “is effectively calibrated to avoid these checks at the border”.
“We need a deal, and we want to conclude a better agreement that will allow, over and over again, not only the current success, but also the opportunity for the future,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only to Toyota, but also to other producers, we must be absolutely able to continue the successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to clarify the time period for production to stop, but in the longer term had warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually result in job losses.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who worked in Bernadette for 24 years and who leads the factory trade union, says that the concerns of the members of the organization are growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can no longer return them.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's responsible meeting with the Deputy Attorney-General, Rod Rosenstein, may be “received to another week”, as the struggle for the candidature of Britta Kavano to the post of Chief Justice continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russian intervention in elections, links between Trump and Russia ' s helpers and potential obstacles to justice on the part of the President.
Whether Trump will be dismissed by the Deputy Attorney-General, thereby endangering the independence of Muller, there has been a mass of speculation in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibilities of the President's improvisation through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refutes this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then held at the UN in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he “would not” lay off Rosestein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a clash with the Senate judicial committee, where Cavanano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaisi Ford, gave evidence.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation of the FBI ' s complaints in Kavano, further delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Prime Minister Trumpa, Sarah Sanders, made a statement on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting has not yet been scheduled, perhaps this week, but perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists contest this assertion: Sanders has not briefed the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the absence of briefings was not due to the “review of the community” of television reporters, although she added:“I will not deny that they play in public.”
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The resident holds more meetings in response to the questions of journalists than any other president before him,” she added, without, however, adding the exact figures, “We have these figures”.
Sanders believed that briefings would still be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask directly the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.”
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have held over the past few weeks, and if you can speak directly to the President of the United States, it's a decent replacement of the press brigins.”
The Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, engaging in public meetings or press conferences with high-ranking officials.
Conferences for the press alone are rare.
Freelance, and sometimes the weird behavior of the president in front of journalists gathered this week in New York may be the answer why it is so.
The Minister of Health addresses EU workers in Scotland with a letter about the fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health asked the EU staff working in Scottish GCC to express their gratitude on behalf of the whole country and to wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, SP, addressed the letter to staff members less than six months before leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already made a commitment to cover the cost of processing status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “The British-EU withdrawal talks continued during the summer, and the expected decision should be reached in this fall.
However, the British Government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
It is therefore right now that I wish to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the contribution of every staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Wheels from across the EU and beyond have brought valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
"Scotland is your home, of course, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombi carried out an emergency operation on head injury
Michael Organ, from Tennessee, reported that Christian Abercrombi's security guard, Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo an emergency operation after his head injury on Saturday after 31-27 to the match with the Vanderbilit Commodores.
The chief trainer in Tennessee, Rod, told journalists that the injury had been received shortly before the break.
“He got to the side of the line and just moved there, ” Ryd said.
Coachs and medical personnel gave Abercrombium oxygen on the sidelines before putting it on the footboard and taking it to a medical examination.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris, from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had an operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “until there are no details of the type/straffic injury,” and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
For Abercrombie, only a second year, it was the first season of Tennessee State, after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before he left the game, he had successfully intercepted five balls, which was a total of 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher seal fee for the purchase of real estate in the U.K.
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers would be charged with a higher recruitment fee for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and the additional money paid would be used to help the homeless.
That step would negate Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
The elevated helmet charge will charge those who do not pay taxes in the U.K.
Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year in favour of the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher grand fee for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds paid will be used to help the homeless, today Theresa May will be announced.
That step would negate Corbin's attempts to attract young voters, who promised to make housing more accessible and increase citizens' incomes.
The increase in the recruitment fee would be charged by individuals and firms not paying taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus made should stimulate the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The allowance for the existing recruitment, including the increase introduced two years ago to purchase secondary and rental housing, could amount to up to 3 per cent.
The Treasury expects that this step will allow up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new London real estate is purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, which leads to price increases and makes it more difficult for buyers who buy their first house to improve their living conditions subsequently.
Many elite areas of the country, particularly in the capital city, have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who have bought housing here and spent most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson had called for a reduction in the recruitment fee to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused major construction firms of producing real estate prices but not actually using them, and called on Ms. May to give up quotas for affordable housing in order to correct the “indecent housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include the control of rent and the cessation of unjustified evictions.
He also wanted to give the local government more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May stated: “I said last year that I had dedicated my conquest to implementing the British dream — that life would be better with every new generation.
That, among other things, means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that for non-United Kingdom citizens as well as foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as accessible as for labour-loving British.
For too many people, the dream of getting their own house has become too far away, and the threat to some to be on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to control Scotland.
The Sundile Club boss, Jack Ross, says that his “end goal” is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
A 42-year-old Scotsman is enjoying the revival of a north-eastern club, which is now ranked third in the first league, which separates three points from the first person.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after he returned to the Scottish Prime Minister last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I've got cap B, and that's all," said RossSportsund BBC Scottland.
“But I grew up watching my father in Scotland with my child in Hampden, and it always attracted me back.
However, this will not be possible unless I am able to become a successful club manager.”
Ross's predecessors, Sundland's managers were also Dick Advokat, David Mojes, Sam Allardys, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Pyette and Paulo De Canio.
Former manager Alloya Athletic said he had not experienced such authoritative names at such large clubs, previously abandoning the Barnsley and Ipswich Toong proposals.
“For me, success at this point will depend on my returning this club to the Prime League.
By its very structure and capabilities, this club certainly belongs to the Prime Ligue,” says the coach.
“To take him out is a difficult task, but I will take it that I have done my job only if I can get the club back.”
Ross is only three years of work as manager, first a assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at the Heaths training staff.
Then he helped Alloya get up from the third level and next season brought St. Mirren out of the lower positions to the champions of the championship.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than ever during his game career in Clyde, Hartlepol, Falkirk, St. Myren and Hamilton Academical.
“It may have been a real overlap,” he recalls in his responsible work in Alloya.
“I sincerely believed that management was better than a game.
That sounds strange because I did everything well, earned a good job in this position and made some progress.
But playing is more complicated.
There's a lot of stuff to do every week.
I still have job stress, but I feel good about being manager.
I've always wanted to lead, and now, by doing this, I feel most comfortable like a fish in water throughout my adult life."
You can listen to a full interview on Sports Sunday, 30 September, on Scottish Radio from 12:00 to 13:00 in English summer.
According to the survey, 17.30 is the ideal time for a beer pin.
Summer heat increased the sale of British pubs, but reduced the sale of restaurants in the grid.
Statistics show that sales in pubs and bars grew by 2.7 per cent in July and that in restaurants, sales fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting company CGA, who obtained this statistics, says: “Further solar activity and longer than expected, England's participation in the world championship means that July continued to trend the previous month, June, when the dog sales grew by 2.8 per cent, and, on the contrary, restaurants fell significantly.”
The June drop in income in the restaurant trade, by 1.8 per cent, also continued in July.
Drunkers and wine bars have produced much higher results in restaurants.
Food-only pubs have also been affected by the sun’s heat, although not as much as restaurants.
There's a sense that people want to jump out in the street just to miss a glass.
Sales of drinks in pubs and bars grew by 6.6 per cent per month and food grew by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in leisure and hotel business, says: “These results continue to be the trend we have observed since late April.
The weather and influence of large social or sporting activities remain critical factors in the trade in the market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially if the decline of 4.8 per cent per year in sales is particularly painful because of the continuing price pressure.
Long, hot summers have proved to be more than ever to be for operators working with food, and it is not yet the fact that, with more moderate temperatures, August will make much more necessary room.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slow decline in the rollover of brands.
The sector sales monitoring of the Coffer Pech Tracker in the British pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses 47 networks with combined flows of more than £9 billion and is a recognized sector-level reference.
One in five children has secret accounts in social networks that they hide from their parents
According to the survey, 1 in 5 children — some as young as 11 — have secret accounts in social networks that they hide from parents and teachers.
Survey of 20,000 high school students found increasing levels of feminine instincts
This news raised concerns about sexual content
Twenty per cent of students said they have a parent's "core" account
However, 1 in 5 children — some as young as 11 years of age — create social accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fairy accountsant “intest”, i.e. instagram, a photo exchange site.
This news increased the fear of sexual content publications.
Twenty per cent of students stated that they had a basic, clean account to which their parents had access but also secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally had access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret accounts, came across a teenager who called on others to “rape him”.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profile in social media, half of whom admitted that one is usually secret.
Head HMC Mike Buchanan says, "Many teenagers are trying to create online space that is not accessible to their parents and teachers, and that's an alarming fact."
Ailed Doyle will become a Scottish light athlete's “voice”
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Ailed Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish light athletics as an observer member of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most famous athletic athlete, President Ian Beatty claims that this is a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from the vast experience of athletes at the international level over the past decade.
“Ailed enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world easy-to-attack community, and we are confident that her participation will be of great benefit in Scotland, ” says Beatty.
Doyle says: “I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can truly make a good contribution and promote sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four golden Olympic medals, now operating as a private commentator on BBC, after a stroke was carried out, has lost its ability to walk.
He writes in his Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I've lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I was okay, and if so, to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I am fully healthy, I have learned to walk again, and I do fishing today!
Thank you so much for your support."
Malotso ads, in which nursing mothers were compared to cows, shared the views of Internet users
The milk company has quarreled on the Internet, publishing an ad where nursing mothers are compared to dead cows.
In a market release, it is said that “the world’s first silent milk production, which can be worn on the breasts”, Elvie’s consumer technology company published an advertising music video that displays the freedom that new milk is giving to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance under a musical track full of hay, which says, "Yes, I feed my milk, but you won't see my tail," and "If you haven't noticed, it's not my breast."
And yet hog: "We suck, sie, we feed our babies with breast-feeding milk, sieve, sit."
The ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video received a mixed response from the viewers, many of whom say it sheds light on the milk industry's “apples”.
“It's a bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to milk unless their children are taken away from them within days of birth, ” writes one user.
Malcotos Elvie is dressed directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is clear that this is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk for mothers who leave their children behind? "
Another user adds: “Responsible advertising”.
Others, on the other hand, protected the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was just great.
"I think it's a great idea.
If I had fed a baby, I would have bought one.
It really made me feel cowy.
The ads are, of course, a little crazy, but that's how it feels.
"Genetic product," wrote one user.
And another comment: “Enjoyful ads designed for mothers who breastfeed (often do so directly in their workplaces or in their toilets) and who really feel a little bit like cows.
This ad is not to praise or reject our milk industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women are showing that they were all dancing with these unseen milkhouses hidden under a bra.
The concept of this advertising campaign is precisely based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, the alvie milk is completely inefficient, without wires or tubes, freely placed in a feeding braider, while an unmemorial, enabling women to move, keep small children, and even go out on the streets during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood specialist at Mother, comments: “The young mind of Elvie is so revolutionary a product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
As we conducted parallels between women and dead cows, we wanted to focus on breastfeeding and all its problems, showing in a funny and cheerful way the incredible sense of freedom that gives the new milk.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk goes into news headlines.
During London’s fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of Marta Yakubowski’s designer, using this product for a purpose.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively constant, in part because the rigid rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump Administration made it difficult to place children at the back-up.
Most sponsors are usually the same undocumented immigrants themselves and are afraid to endanger their stay in the country by taking the child under the authority of the child.
Risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential guarantors and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior immigration and customs officer, witnessed to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to be assisted by the remaining minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested were not previously tried.
“About 80 per cent of those who are either guardians or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed the crime.
We are therefore continuing the persecution of these persons, ” said Olbens.
The authorities said that, in an effort to expedite the process of child custody, they had introduced new regulations requiring some of them to be brought to justice within a month of detention and not 60 days later.
To declare their legal status to the Immigration Court, many are video-linked, not personal.
Those considered to be not eligible for assistance would be deported rapidly.
According to the employees of the shelters and the information available in the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to be alarmed or depressed, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is having difficulty are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them the emotional time to prepare or say good-bye could exacerbate the trauma with which many of them are already struggling.
Syria orders the “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualm also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country had been at war for eight years.
Mualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions”, he said to the assembled ones.
Mualem insists that Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been expelled from its homes, is “a war against terrorism almost finished”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-affected country.
As for the refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and he accused “some Western countries” of“the spread of irrational insurance”, which had encouraged refugees to remain outside the country.
“We called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens”, he said.
“They politicize what must be a humanitarian question”.
The United States and the European Union cautions that Syria will not be assisted in reconstruction until there is a political agreement to end war between Asada and the opposition.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major pillar of Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented the widespread attack by the Syrian forces backed by Russia against the province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had had “a clear time frame” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including Al-Qaida-related fighters of the Nourah front, who would be “done”.
The United Nations Messenger Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, composed of representatives of the Government and the opposition, will be convened soon to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Mualem set out the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, stating that the Commission's work should be limited to “consideration of the articles of the Constitution in force” and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the second deadline
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win his election in 2020 if the impeachment and the scandal did not bring his presidency to an early end, which is probably the hope of many liberal spectators.
And that will no doubt be “the most dramatic presidential finale in all history.”
At the moment, there is no sign of the weariness of the viewers.
Since 2014, the prime ratings have more than doubled, to 1.05 million CNN, and almost three times, to 1.6 million MSNCs.
According to the Nilesen, the Fox News had an average of 2.4 million prime-time spectators, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddown Show" had achieved the ratings of cable channels, collecting 3.5 million spectators at evenings during the main news.
“It's a fire to which people hang because it's out of our minds,” says Neal Bair, director of the ABC "A marked survivor," about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, who becomes president after the destruction of the Capitol as a result of the attack.
Nell Scowell, a long-published comedy writer and author, “Only funny: a few unpleasant truths about entering the "Qull" of the Hollywood boys, offers another theory.
She recalls driving a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why? ” she asked.
He replied, "But because he's funny!" Mrs. Skovelle said.
In all of this chaos, there's something valuable -- it's fun.
Of course, unlike all the rest of the content broadcast on television, Washington's newsline can determine the future of "Roo v. Wade" and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and global health.
Exclusion is luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Yet, when you have been watching for six consecutive hours how a group of experts discuss Bob Woodworth's use of a "blowlight" for his book Strike, or Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 of ostrich skin (funted prider's clothes", says The Washington Post), or a sharp description by Stormy Daniels, say, yes, Mr. Trump's anatomy, is already outside of normal awareness.
I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes, for example.
“Part of his work is to make us feel that the reality show is that he feeds you on something every night, ” says Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wellhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars about the changing actor composition of the Trump show and the day-to-day turn of the story (drive with N.F.L., praised by Kim Chen Ying).
You can't afford to miss any episode, or you're hopeless.
When I contacted Mr. Fleas this week, there were 27 degrees of heat in the northern shore of the Kauai, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC during CNN records.
He could not turn away from the screen, at least not when he showed how Brett Cavanaugh appeared before the Senate Legal Committee and the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people would say, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’ ” says Mr. Fleece.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Outsider money goes into the worst interim election run by the White House.
It is no wonder that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives cash flows as a result of the change of districts in Congress, where two officials are in the same race for the same place.
This suburb of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed for so long, supports a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamba, who won a seat in another district in the extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb opposes another active official, the republic of Kit Rothfus, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps substantially with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had ruled in January that the old areas were in violation of the Constitution as a result of pre-election frauds.
The race in the new 17th region has generated a heated debate on the financing of campaigns between financial forces of the main party, the Committee of the Congress of Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lamba has become known in Pennsylvania after victory with a small difference in March for the special elections in the Congress in the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by the Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give democracies a little advantage.
US ordered El Salvador for China ' s support, but then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had led to a negative reaction by Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and his property was also in Panama until the partners evicted the management team of Trump.
The representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the “recent decision to deny Taiwan”, declared at the beginning of this month the Spokesperson of the Department of Heser Nauert.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received some $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for that Central American country, with its high level of unemployment and homicide.
Against the background of regular internal meetings, the representatives of North Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to take stock of a similar meeting that took place last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior management representatives had made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and had actually stopped considering the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled to take place in mid-October and will be attended by Vice-President Mike Pens, as a sign that the Administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without carrying any further stringent messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three United States officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal matters subject to anonymity.
Their reports also confirmed a different analyst within the administration but also referred to the conditions of anonymity.
Learn History
The next step might be to report by Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible harassment of Mr. Trumpa, which is now very significant in public records.
Mr. Muller is also reportedly investigating the existence of the Trump and Russia conspiracy and its attacks in the past elections.
If the Congress succeeds, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in this body, just as he prepares to speak again before the electorate and perhaps eventually before the jury from among his colleagues.
But there is a lot of "if"; I don't mean to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We'll all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to set up a coup d ' état and overthrow Hitler, and that would have happened had the West resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we did not do so, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the bloodshed that followed.
The course of history is at such points, and the silent march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are going through some of these broken points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisss Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney-General, the person who controls the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
She has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year he offered to record undercover the activities of the President and talked about his inadmissibility for office.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that the Times are not correct.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation of Britta Kavano is not complete or true, or if he is still confirmed as a Chief Justice despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we, in the medium term, vote in favour of Congress, which will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail to go through these trials with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to walk through them in dignity, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechslovak Jew, sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as she had once worked as an ambassador's house, where I lived many years later.

With such a family past as I may not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans, of the Rangers, is optimistic about the front of the clash with the Vienna Rapid football club.
The Rangers are taking Vienna's Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after an impressive nothing in Spain over the Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will allow them to take strong positions in Group G of the League of Europe.
The tram was prevented by Graham Dorrans, a paralegal for the first time in the season before a draw-up of two against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
“It was a good time for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” said a 31-year-old football player.
“We have entered the game, believing that we can get something, and that we have left with no one.
Perhaps we could, after all, deal with it, but in general, it was probably a fair outcome.
They may have been better at the first time, and our success is in the second half, where we were better off.
There will be another big European night on this Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they did a good job in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we can move forward and get a good outcome.
Last year seemed like a heavy one, given all that was involved in my injuries and the substitutions at the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is beautiful, and the guys are really enjoying it; the training has been done on raur.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past season and succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear for their pension savings
Although the interviewers had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be cared for, few had spoken to their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the national study said that they had discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
However, only 10% said they had spoken to their children about the matter.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't try to discuss the subject with them, ” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationalwood on life insurance.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for what they may have to care for if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Talk to your consultant and family, where and how you will receive medical care, as this may be an important factor in the cost of making a decision.
Concentrate with your financial adviser: he will help you to develop a payment plan for these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or self-insured by your own property, provided that you have money.
Order your legal documents: Remove your legal batteries.
Trust in medical care and appoint a trusted person who will control your health care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
It is also recommended that consideration be given to the possibility of creating financial confidence.
A trusted person should be chosen to help you make financial decisions and to keep track of the payment of your accounts if you are not in a position to do so.
Consider, too, the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needed emergency medical care and was on his way to the hospital.
In that case, can you provide information on what drugs he takes and on what he has allergies?
Write down all these details on paper so you can prepare yourself in case.
Martin adds: “It is not only the availability of finance, but also the choice of doctors”.
"What kind of medicine do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Take this plan and write it down."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed by the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian town of Palau on Friday, and the number of deaths was expected to increase.
Rescue workers cannot obtain any information from Donggal, a region north of Palau, which is closer to the 7.5 point of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated as a result of natural disasters in Palau.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Donggal on the island of Sulawes:
Palau is the capital of the province of Central Sulawes, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulaves, with an estimated population of 379,800 (2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an area extending along 300 km (180 miles) along the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The district, the administrative district below the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture form the basis of the economy of the province of Central Sulawis and, in particular, of the Dongala coastal region.
nickel mining is also important for the province’s economy, but mainly concentrated in Morvali, on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the tsunami has caused several destruction in Palau and Donggal over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by the tsunami and hundreds of homes destroyed in Donggal.
The tsunami also took place in western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic ring of fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia in Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A sequence of severe earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 struck southern Java, Indonesia ' s most populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: The magnitude earthquake occurred in Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.

Senior son of Sarah Payin is arrested on charges of domestic violence
Traek Payin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska, and the vice-cup to President Sarah Payin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old, Paylin, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, meddling in a situation of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked her up.
According to KTU, Peylin is in the Mat-Su detention facility and will be released on bail at $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “universal innocence”.
Three minor crimes of Class A are threatening to be committed, which means that he may be deprived of his liberty for a period of up to one year and fined for $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offence punishable by imprisonment for up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges were brought against Peylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Payina.
His mother, Sarah Payin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, falsification of a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of alcohol abuse in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her on the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, after explaining his son's violent behaviour as a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his employment in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - point earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawis, north-east of Jakarta, Indonesia.
Video recordings of accidents appear on social networks.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palau when the tsunami struck the beach.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office wants to impose a rare death sentence on a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office in New York seeks the death penalty for Saiful Saipa, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, which killed eight people, a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been used in the State since 1953.
In October, Saipov, aged 30, allegedly rented a home Dept truck to attack a bicycle track on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intently” killed eight people and deliberately caused serious bodily harm, according to the notification of intent to achieve the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
According to the judicial record, the death penalty may be imposed on both of these charges.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read Saipu with 22 prosecution points, which included eight assassinations for the purpose of a reket commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “smartly planned and deliberate”, Saipo carried it out, it is said, “rejectional, cruel and criminal”.
“Syfurlo Habibullawevich Saipov injured, damaged and lost families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Lor Dekadt, Darren Dreyk, Ariel Erlya, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagrenko”, states the notification of intent.
Five of those killed were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since, in the Southern District of New York, the prosecutor requested the death penalty.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes was convicted for the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The latest death penalty in the federal case in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed with an electric wall on 19 June 1953.
According to Saip's judicial records, a native of Uzbekistan showed that he did not repent after his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saip told the authorities that he had been inspired to watch the ISIS video on the phone.
He also asked that the ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room, and reported to the police.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on the Saipa side, said that they were “extremely disappointed” by the decision of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
“We believe that a decision on the use of the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only add to the pain of these events for all its participants,” said Patton.
The defence of Saipua had previously asked prosecutors not to press for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament from Tori says that NAJEL FARAJ should not be held responsible for the Brexit negotiations
During the protest of the Tori Nigel Fawa conference today vowed to “mobilize the people's army”.
Former Ukip leader said that politicians should “be sensitive to” Europeans because a member of the Parliament of Theresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boun, a member of the conservative party, told the meeting in Birmingham that Britain would already “be released” if Mr. Faraz had been Secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May in trying to reconcile her deep-seated ranks is compounded by the fact that the members of the Tori party who are opposed to leaving the EU join in a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The primer is working hard to preserve his compromise plan, as expressed at Chester's in the midst of the attack by Brexit's supporters, his opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, thus forcing the Europeans and the Leborists to choose between her package and the haasom.
Mr. Boon told Leave Menas Leave at a meeting in Solikhal that he wanted "to win Churchrs".
He suggested that Mr. Faraj should be given a level and should be held accountable for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been responsible, we would have gone out, ” he said.
Diputate Wellingborough added: "I'll continue to speak for Brexit, but we need to play Chesters."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be dependent.
We want to lay down our laws in our country."
Mr. Boun rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their opinion and wanted to stay is completely wrong”.
Brexit from Tora Andrea Jenkins was also at the meeting, and he gave a comment to the journalists, saying, "I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people."
“Churches are not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote in favour of the plan, it is also not popular among the members of our party and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and first and foremost electing us.
Please put off Chester's side, and begin to listen to what you are told."
In her sharp appeal to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers remain in their work if they are true to their promises”.
Mr. Faraz said that if politicians were to submit to the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they must be forced to feel “in what way”.
“It is now a question of trust between us people and our political class,” he said.
“They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you do this."
Addressing the thrilled crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit's betrayal, to feel like it.
“We mobilize this country's people's army to win the Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent and proud by the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit’s opponents had a demonstration on Birmingham, followed by a two - hour meeting in the city center.
Several activists waved Theory v. Brexit posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, criticized the conservators because of security problems in their party ' s mobile annex.
“And these people claim they can build IT systems and technologies of Canada plus plus, to work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is one continuous farce.
The good Brexit doesn't exist in principle," he says.
Warren plans to “explore” the possibilities of participating in the presidential race
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Member of the U.S. Parliament, says that, following the November elections, she will be “incitely studying the possibilities of voting for the Presidents”.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat told us about her future at the West Massachusetts Town Hall.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, was running in November for re-election against Jeff Dile, a member of the Republican Party who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There's talk that she's got the chance to take Trump's post in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Holico, she held another meeting with the voters; since Trump took office, it has been her 36th meeting with the electorate in the town hall.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to start” our broken government, which required a woman upstairs.
Simsa was arrested as a result of the murder, the player LSU was arrested
The Baton-Rose Police, Louisiana State, announced on Saturday that a suspect in a murder (or shot) by a basketballist, LSU Wade Sims, on Friday, had been arrested.
At 11 a.m., at a press conference, the Baton-Rose police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years.
On Friday, the Police Department released video tapes asking for help in identifying the person who was able to film the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near a South University company on Friday morning.
“ Wade Sims sustained a gunshot wound in his head, which resulted in his death, ” stated police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade went for his friend and was shot dead by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to participating in the incident, carrying his arms and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson failed to resist in his arrest and was detained in police custody at the East Baton Ruzj district police station.
A young person grew up in Baton-Ruzz, played 32 games at 10 points last season, and won an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 fees.
Grand In Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the World Champion after command tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Fettil
Since Walter Bottas was qualified to defeat Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes' command tactics will play a major role in the race.
From the pod Bottas has started well and almost hangs on Hamilton, when he was defending his position on the first two turns, and he invited Fett to attack his teammate.
Fettel first went to the top of the pit, left Hamilton to rub on the tail of the whole band -- the choice that became decisive.
Mercedes went to the top-top one round later, and after the Fétel, but Hamilton, after some struggle “the wheel in the wheel”, broke out, causing the driver of the Ferrari to be reluctant to leave the interior free, risking to catch up after a double movement to protect at the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstapin started from the back of the grid and was 7th in place by the end of the first circle.
He then led most of the race on his native tires, with the aim of quickly completing the race by pushing Kim Rykonnen to the fourth place.
As a result, he went to the top-top on the 44th round, but couldn't increase the pace to the remaining eight circles, as Ryckonen took fourth place.
The day was hard to deal with, as Walter did a fantastic weekend job and showed real grace by sharing it with me.
The team did such an extraordinary job to have a couple tricks on the reserve," Hamilton said.
Promulgate sign language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Dainn Finsinstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her allegation that she had not published a letter from Christine Blaisi Ford, accused of Britta Kavano, a candidate for the position of Chief Justice, in sexual harassment.
When the President spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not mention directly the statements given by Ford before the Senate Legal Committee, saying that what was taking place in the Senate showed that the participants in the event were “silent, hideous and false people”.
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what has been taking place in the last few days in the Senate, is fine; it is anger, anger, cruelty, indecency and lies,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinsinstein, did you hear the information?
Do you remember her answer... did you "listen" the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't get mad.
All right, stop.
No, we didn't, he added, with the senator's instinct.
In July, Feinsinstein sent a letter detailing the charges made by Ford v. Kavano, and in early September it was illegally published, but Fainsstein denied that the leak had taken place in her office.
“I haven’t concealed Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I haven’t merged her information, ” said Fainste to the Committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she requested.”
However, the manner in which she denied the charges of diversion did not seem to appeal to the president, who commented on it during the Sabbath meeting: “This is what I'm going to say to you: the body’s tongue has failed her.
Maybe she didn't "silent," but the body's tongue was the worst I've ever seen."
In continuing to defend his candidate for the position of Chief Justice, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, the President suggested that democracies use these accusations for their own ends.
“They're definitely trying to regain power in every way they can.
We are watching a state of impureness, they don't care who they're going to hurt who they're going through to get power and control,” quotes Mediaite as the president said.
British Locomb: Dundy Stars 5-3 Belfast Jayants
Patrick Duyer killed two heads, for Jayants in a game against Dundee.
In the game of the Elite hockey League, Dunde Stars paid for a Friday defeat against Belfast Jayants, winning a Saturday match in favour of Dunde.
Jaitants had an early double-edged advantage because of Patrick Doyer and Francis Bowler's strikes.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised their home team level before Duyer led Jayants into leaders.
François Bouchard compared the Dandi account to the two heads of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen.
For the people of Adam Kifa, who had won the Dandi with the account 2:1 in Belfast on Friday evening, that was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
This was the fourth meeting between the parties in the season, when Jayants won the three previous games.
The first tablet of Duyer arrived at the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m., after the naked pass of Kendall McFall, with David Rutherford's support, followed by the doubleing of Bovier four minutes later.
During the start-up period, Sullivan returned his owners to the game of 13:10 before Matt Markwardt helped Cooney level the account by 15:16.
Duyer was satisfied that Jayants took over the initiative on the first break when he hit the second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The owners regrouped, and Bouchard set the bill up again, killing the foot at a multiple weight of 27:37.
Couni and Charles Corcorran united to help Nilesen give the "Dandi" the first time in the match to take the lead at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured the victory, held the rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the end of the period.
Jaitants, who have lost four of the last five matches, is now sent to Milton Kenes for the next match, which will be held on Friday.
The accident was destroyed so that hundreds of people on board the plane could escape the earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously assigned to the hero’s rank after his conscious death to ensure that the aircraft with hundreds of passengers was able to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing as a result of the massive tsunami earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong underground formations continue to destroy the area, and many of the inhabitants of the city of Palau are being hit by the debris of the buildings.
Despite the flight of his colleagues to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the terriblely desperate stage of the airport of Mutira Cis Al Jufry, the town of Palu.
He remained in his seat to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the airstrip, was able to fly safely.
Then, when the tower seemed to break, he jumped off it.
Later he died at the hospital.
A representative of Indonesia’s Aeronautics Johannes Sirait stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Bilkpapan in Kalimatán to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the trainer died before the helicopter went to Palau.
“We deeply regret this loss,” he added.
However, the authorities are concerned that thousands of people may be killed by the earthquake, since, according to disaster management agencies, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Buttong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to increase, as a large number of people are still under siege and many have still failed to get out,” says the representative of the Agency, Satopo Purvo Nugro.
The towers, which reached a height of six metres, devastated the city of Palau, where the mass burial of the dead would take place on Sunday.
The military and commercial aircraft provide humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says Sky News: "Serious help brings the victims every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markers are everywhere looted.”
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, relates to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross’s staff are already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what they're going to stay there.
The tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but it can be much worse.”
President Joko Viodo of Indonesia arrived in Palau on Sunday and addressed the armed forces of the country in particular, saying: “I ask you all to work day and night to perform all evacuation tasks.
“ Are you ready? ”
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was affected by the Lomboke earthquake, which claimed over 550 lives.
Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one person disappeared after the plane crashed in the Lagoon.
The flight crew, a victim of a disaster in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person is missing, while it has been said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew safely left the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini states that she has no information on one male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
Avi Company stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find that person.
The company was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about a passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
The local sailors helped save the other passengers and the aircraft crew after they had fallen into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The company also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The causes of the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The aircraft and the U.S. Navy state that the aircraft landed in the Lagun near the airstrip.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft was unable to land on the airstrip.
Bill Janes, an American passenger, says that the plane has become too low to enter the airstrip.
"And that's very good," adds Janes.
Janes told us that he and other passengers were able to get through an accident on a sinking plane because the water level was over the belt.
He also told us that the flight attendants panicked and shouted on board and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing nearby docks also helped with the rescue by means of an inflatable boat that transported people to the shore before the aircraft reached the water for about 30 metres (100 feet).
Air Safety Network figures show that over the past two decades, 111 people have lost their lives in air accidents with companies registered in PNG, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst has been able to prove the burning of a woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution brought a case against a man accused of burning in 2014, a Missionan woman.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, gave long-term testimony as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the department how he used cell phone records to draw up a general picture of the actions of the 29-year-old Quinn Tellers accused and of Jessica Chambers' 19-year-old victim the night she died.
Routlett told him that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to that, Tellis spent the night with Chambers, contrary to his previous statement, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said that he was with his friend Michael Sandford, but according to the evidence, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when that fact was discovered, Sandford was interrogated by the police.
In his testimony, Sandford said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sandford if Telis was telling the truth, claiming that the night was in a Sanford truck, Sandford said that it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to phone records, they were only convened within one week.
Rowlett also showed that some time after Chambers Tellers died, she removed her text messages, her calls and her contact information from her phone.
'He wiped it out of his life,' says Hale.
Protection should begin on Sunday to present its concluding arguments.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be submitted to the jury later that day.
What's a known hip hop?
Three hip hops are going to fight the negative attitude of that genie by filling their music with positive content.
The High Brad of Bristal claims that the hip hop has changed, leaving original political and social problems.
The group wants to get back to its roots and again make the known hip popular.
Artists like The Futures and Common have recently witnessed a revival in Britain thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
The New York nanny sued a couple for racist textings.
A New York girl was taken to court for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny was a "other black", which the woman mistakenly sent the baby to her husband.
Spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that a claim is made against “the whole of extortion.”
Linsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she learned that the new nanny offered by the Child Care Service, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived at her family's first job in 2016.
"NEE-ELEEEEEEET, NOT ALL THAT ONE CRUEL," wrote Mrs. Placco-Flexman in a smoulder of his husband.
However, instead of sending texts to her husband, she had twice mistakenly sent him to Miss Morris.
Upon learning of her sizeiness, the "new-born" Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, claiming in the service that the babysitter, who was African-American, had been doing her job badly, and that they were expecting a Filipino instead of an African American woman, reported New York Post.
Morris paid for one day’s work and then sent home for Uber.
Maurice now sus a married couple and claims compensation for the dismissal of $350 per day for six months, under the terms of the original oral arrangement, which were not, however, established by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable”, she said on Friday, adding, “And I know that it's discrimination.”
The spouses disagree with the charge of racism, and state that the dismissal of Morris could be considered a reasonable step, for they could no longer trust her if they offended her.
“My wife sent her in a message that she didn’t really mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said husband, Joe Plasco, a Post.
"But you would trust your children with someone you were mean to, even if you were loaded, with that one you didn't want?
Would you trust your newborn baby?
And give it to you!'
Calling for “exemption”, Placco said that his wife had given birth to a child just two months ago and had become “the most difficult situation”.
‘Are you ready to pursue the man in such a situation?
"Not very nice of you," added a bank worker specializing in investment.
Judicial proceedings are still in progress, but public opinion has already handed down its sentence on social networks, accusing a couple of unacceptable behaviour and logistical problems.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers wouldn't understand the walk with a speaking bear, said in a new letter
Bunda’s daughter, Karen Yankel, born shortly after the publication was accepted, was quoted as saying: “It is hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the work for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know that Paddington has a huge success.”
She also explained that her father, before writing a children's book about honey bear, had been an operator on BBC, and would have refused to publish with optimism, and added that the 60-year-old edition of his books had been “and bitter” because they had not been the author in the past year.
With regard to Paddington's very bearer, she makes reference to him as “the most important member of our family, ” and that her father was very proud of the fact that his character eventually became known.
“He was a quiet and modest man, ” his daughter says.
“He was so real to Paddington, and it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of them, although he did not really consider the success of his own merit.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also paid tribute to the bear itself.”
I had to say good-bye to my dying daughter over the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to Nizza Hospital Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors failed to save her life.
“We regularly called and said that everything was really bad, something went wrong, ” says Mrs. Edn-Laperuza.
“Then he called again and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that we should say goodbye.
I did.
I said, "You know, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medical treatments that doctors gave her forced her heart to work gradually ceased to function as she left her body.
She died before she expected.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself tight.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan Laperuz, in the heat of losing her daughter, went on a plane along with other passengers, dying of the great loss she had just suffered.
“No one around me knew what had happened, ” she says.
“My head lost sight of me, and I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during my flight that I had this full-blown feeling of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her."
Women survivors prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide try to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey put cards on the Welch Bridge with comforting words and telephone numbers where people can ask for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he started depression and when he was 18 years old, he killed himself.
“I don’t want other parents to experience what I experience every day, ” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, tells us that her son was a great cook and had a damn charming smile.
"All loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, the light was kind of in the room."
But before his death he left because of the terrible times that really came to be.”
That happened in 2014, and Tyler, who had died with him, found his brother, who was 11 years old.
Mrs Davis says, "I'm not afraid that I'm going to get a chain reaction."
Mrs Davis invented these cards, "that people know there's someone to talk to and talk to, even if it's your friend.
You can't sit and be quiet, you have to talk to people."
Mrs. Humfries, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, his husband, who had lived with him for 15 years — not soon after his mother died.
“He didn’t say that he felt depressed, upset or anything like that, ” she says.
“ A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his mood.
At Christmas, he was particularly ill; he did not even look at the children when they opened their gifts."
She says that his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to go through this, this event shocked our family.
It broke it apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Britta Kavano is hanging in his hair: the FBI is starting an investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he had asked for — an investigation limited over time and volume, we could bring some unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “break” against a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the reason for their fluctuations.
The interim elections will be held only five weeks later, on 6 November, and if — it is expected — everything is bad for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the person they want and to elect him as the highest judge in the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators by lobbying support for Mr. Kavano, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who had then served as his personal secretary, Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 democracies.
It was still unclear whether Mr. Kavano would be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the issue of equality of votes and confirm his appointment as Chief Justice.
The number of North Korean passers-outs declined at Kim
Since Kim Jong Eun came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean runners in South Korea has fallen, and a South Korean legislator has declared it.
Mr. Byon Seug, referring to the data of the Department of the South, said that, compared with 2,706 escape cases recorded in 2011, that figure had fallen to 1,127.
Mr. Park said that the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates imposed by smuggling agents, had been key factors.
Stunning of public comments does not make any comment.
The overwhelming majority of the North Korean occupiers are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people are travelling through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considered the refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often subjected them to forced repatriation.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still in a state of war, has improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the deadlocked negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This took place following the June historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Eun in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea ' s Foreign Minister Ri Yun Ho accused the United States of obstructing progress on the issue.
“Unless we have the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and, in such circumstances, we will in no way be able to start disarmament unilaterally”, said Mr. Ree in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pélosi calls Bretta Cavanano “survival” and claims that he is not fit for work before the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi called Bretta Kavano, a candidate for the position of supreme judge, “exclusive” and said that he was not acceptable to the Supreme Court because of his temperature.
Pelosi made this comment on Saturday's interview at Texas Trebune Festival, Texas.
“I cannot help but think that if a woman had ever been allowed to act like this, she would have been immediately called a ‘survivor’,’ says Pélosie about her reaction to Kavano’s testimony in the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavanano emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blaise Ford’s allegations of sexual harassment, which were alleged to have occurred when both were teenagers.
Cavanaugh was pretty emotional, and at times he even burst into shouting and suffocating, talking about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the democracies of the committee, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and well-planned murder of an individual”, organized by liberals, dissociated by Hillary Clinton losing the presidential election of 2016.
The Pelosi also said that, in her view, Cavanano ' s testimony had only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had prejudiced against the democracies.
“I think that he disqualifies himself with his allegations, as well as his assault on the Clinton and the democracies,” she says.
The pesos were indignant when asked if she would try to hold Kavano accountable, if his guilt was confirmed, and if the democracies received a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say, if he does not tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI, he is not lawful not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he is in,” said Pella.
Kavano is currently a judge of the D.C District Court of Appeal.
The Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavano with regard to the Act on Accessive Health Services or Rou v. Wade, as he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearing on his candidature, Cavanaugh was bypassed by the question of whether he would reject some of the Supreme Court ' s decisions.
“It is not the time to let an hysteric and prejudiced man enter the position of a supreme judge, but to say, ‘That is so great,’ ” says Pelosie.
And women have to have it.
It is righteous anger, months, and years of rage, and it cannot pass through it without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," Ms. Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think?"
She continued: "I was very helped by a woman who worked somewhere in office, and she told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that explained to her interlocutor, "You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I am really angry."
And then she just kept talking.
This approach really impressed me.”
The tears are allowed as a way out for anger, partly because they're misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in an office where men dominated: one day I wept at violent anger, but I was caught by a elderly woman who was a blind manager, who I was always afraid of, and took me to the ladder.
“Never let them see you crying, ” she said to me.
“They do not know that you weep for evil.
They think that you are upset, and they rejoice, thinking they have finally proved you.'
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some unsuspecting affair and got out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to prevent her from running for the presidency.
“This decision was not well thought out”, she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“The seven other candidates had already participated in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called that case the White and the Seven Dwarfs.
The campaign was on its way to the end, and it had fallen far behind in collecting funds, and she vowed that she would not participate in the race if she hadn't collected $2 million.
It seemed like a totally lost cause.
She found that some of her supporters offered only 250 dollars to men.
“What is it for them, a meaningful commodity, or what? ” she wondered.
When she spoke, declaring that she would not carry out an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotion — gratitude to those who supported her, disappointment at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access to voters, and anger over gender discrimination that she suffocated.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls how the press had reacted to her.
"May have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still wondering, what would they write on my monument?
"She cried without end"?
How can the war against America benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first phase of the US-China trade war was deafening, and although the battle is far from over, the divide between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, first issued a warning at the beginning of this year, taxing Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The largest escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected goods worth $200 billion ($150 billion), in fact taxing half of all goods from China to the United States.
Beijing has paid equivalent returns every time, recently imposing duties on United States goods amounting to $60 billion, ranging from five to ten per cent.
China promised that the US response would be equal every time, and the world’s second largest economy was unlikely to face at least the slightest difficulty soon.
The replacement of Washington to decline would mean a retraction, but a public retreat in the United States would be too shameful for Ci Jinpin, President of China.
However, it was the opinion of the experts that if Beijing was able to play its maps correctly, the pressure of the United States trade war could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to an economic burden in any of those countries is in fact much more dangerous than previously recognized observers, ” says Ebigle Grace, a research scientist at the New American Security Centre (Center for New American Security), specializing in Asia.
Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was prepared to return refugees
Syria states that it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks assistance in the reconstruction of a country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualm reported that conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and secure as a result of counter-terrorism successes,” he said.
The Government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to enable people to live there in peace.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of the terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that had affected their daily lives, were now in place.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulam said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for helping to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance on any terms or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe completes the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe won the 2018 Rider Cup by winning the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Holf National in the suburb of Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six consecutive times on European soil, and European Riedera Cup has failed to win since 1993.
Europe returned its crown, thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who had gained 14.5 points for victory over the United States.
The American star Phil Michaelson, who persisted in fighting most of the tournament, made his first long shot in the water on the 16th hole of steam 3, went into his match with Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari defeated in all his rounds, becoming the 1st to 4th players who had ever been on 5 to 0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated by 5/4 the lowest rating on the European team, Turbier Olesen of Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, David Johnson, was down to 2:1 Jan Polter of England, who may have been participating in Reider's Cup.
The Spaniard Serhio Garcia, a veteran of eight Cups of Ryder, was the winner of a tournament throughout Europe with 25.5 points for a career.
"Of course I don't cry, but I can't hold back today.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get a cup again.
It's on the team, and I'm glad I could help,' says emotional Garcia after a European victory.
He hands over the torch to his compatriot John Rama, who won the victory on Sunday over the American legend of Golf Tiger Woods at 2:1 in a single game.
“I feel tremendous pride in this victory — I grew up watching the game of Tiger Woods,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are strange to one of the greatest players in all of the times who won the 14 main titles, with the exception of Jack Niklaus.
The assembly of the United States fought for the weekend in vain to try to succeed, and the exceptions were Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed the golf of the highest class throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fewrick said after his team's grudging statement: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we managed to get a little hit by Europe.
It didn't work.
We take off our hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played great.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Committee of the Cup of Ryder, and we will move forward in making progress.
I love all 12 kids, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to lose.
We have lost."
Red tide: The concentration of micro-organisms declined in Pinnels, Manati and Sarasot
The last Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission report shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Koller, the concentration of micro-organisms has been reduced.
The red tide extends approximately 130 miles [130 km] along the coast of northern Pinll to southern Li.
Beetles can be observed about 10 miles off the Hillsborough, but their numbers have declined significantly compared to last week.
A red tide is also observed in Pasco District.
The average concentration in and near Pinellas district was reported last week, from low to high concentrations in the Hillsboro coastal zone, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasot districts and coastal zones, average concentrations in and around Charlotte district, high concentrations on the coast of Li district, and low concentrations in the Koler district.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasta, Lee and Koler, there is still the likelihood of a tearing of the airway.
No such possibility was reported in Northern Florida last week.
