FANO Russian Federation will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) will co-host the third Expert Session “Assessment of the Efficiency of Scientific Organizations”.
The meeting will be the final one in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, and will be reported in a press release issued as “Lenta.ru”.
At the third meeting, it is planned to take stock of the work of the Expert Session for the year and to develop a final set of indicators to assess the impact of scientific organizations.
Participants in the event plan to discuss the rules for establishing expert groups responsible for evaluating the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be a closing event, followed by developments in the development of a unified approach for all three academics to the methodology for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
We have succeeded in doing so over the past five months, and the final version of the normative instruments is being agreed upon.
As a follow-up to the next session, we must complete the development of science science and expertise processes, agree on the phases and timing of the assessment,” said Elena Aksenov, director of the Russian Federation's expert and analytical office.
Representatives of more than a hundred Russian scientific institutions will participate in the event.
The resolution is expected to be adopted as a result.
The congregation will begin at 10 a.m. on 16 September 2014, at Moscow City, Solyanka Street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect native stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California at Santa Cruz have studied the disturbing mixing and its effect on chemical uniformity in star-coops.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow the stars to be found in the ancestral ones, that is, arising from one cluster.
The results of their studies were published in Nature magazine and can be found briefly on the university website.
The same chemical composition of nearby stars is caused by a disturbing mixing in clouds of gas preceding the formation of stars.
Even if the star is then left by a star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of the formation of its natural stars.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside a cluster might lead to a difference in its chemical content from that of a relative in a cluster.
Modelling results by astrophysicists show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, scientists used a supercomputer to model two inter-divert gas streams that together formed a cloud.
This facility has been converted into a cluster over several million years by its own gravity.
The scientists added paints to the initial gas streams and found that the fast-turbed mixing in the surface reached a high degree of chemical uniformity.
Astrophysicists believe that their research proves that it is possible to find or determine the possible regions of the formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrested 20 years after the high speed motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was confiscated after it had been driven at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h speed zone and through the bushland to escape from the Pilbar police.
The Carrat police patrol tried to stop the blue motorcycle this morning by discovering that his speed was 125 km/h when he left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police report that the rider did not stop and continued on the Berges Road movement, then dropped off to the Bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
The motorcycle and the driver's description were observed next to the home of Waltkot Wey in Bulgar.
The Carrata police accused a 20-year-old man of refusing to stop and drive dangerously.
It must appear before the Carrata World Court on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.
The training year will not start until October

This was reported by Igor Kostenko, Minister of Education and Science of the self-proclaimed Republic.
He said that 11 per cent of students had left for other regions of Ukraine and that 20 per cent had left for Russia.
Schools in the territory controlled by the DDP will not begin until 1 October.
However, teachers will be employed on 1 September.
The investigation of the TT-204 disaster in Vnonovo was completed in 2012
The Russian Investigative Committee has completed the criminal investigation into the accident of TT-204 at Vnonovo Airport in December 2012.
This is what the FK was reporting today.
“The Moscow interregional transport investigation office of the Russian Investigation Committee has completed an investigation into the criminal case brought about by the accident of the RED 204 aircraft at Vnukov airport on 29 December 2012, on the basis of the offence provided for in article 263, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code, of a violation of traffic safety and of the operation of air transport, causing the death of two or more persons/persons due to negligence”, states the report of the agency.

George Webster is accused of rape at hotels in Noir and Pitlohra
A man will be tried for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28 years old, is charged during the High Court hearing in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at the Scottlands Hotel in Pitlohr, Pertshire County, 7 June 2013.
Webster is said to have attacked her when she was "out of consciousness, asleep and unable to give consent."
In addition, Westster is accused of rapeing another woman at the Holf Wew Hotel in Nairn, which is located in the North Scotland Hill, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Ray appointed a hearing before the High Court in Edinburg on 17 November.
Lavrov: Russia will not “roll the door” for the new sanctions and will not leave the WTO.
Russia won't "kick the door" for the new sanctions.
This was stated today by the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergey Lavrov, in his address to students and teachers of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
As for our response to the new wave of the anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even talk, fantasizing, because everything has to be specifically calculated,” he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners would like to do, then we'll decide how to respond.
It's not going to be connected to a guy's doors, some insults, that's false -- the Minister said.
Above all, we will be driven from our interests, interests to protect our own economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and the conclusions of the partners ' actions towards their adequacy, contractability and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions can be judged very well by the partners, as well as by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
If, in the voice, they say, "They're also going to hurt us, but we're forced to do it to punish Russia," it's probably not quite adequate."
With regard to WTO's withdrawal of the FM in response to possible new sanctions, there was no.
On the contrary, we want to learn more about the WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes, as Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, we believe, discriminatory EU policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of deming and anti-dumping measures are applied against the economic sectors of the Russian Federation.
“We are ready to engage the WTO mechanisms and to defend our position against the application of the EU third energy package in a retrospective manner”, said Lavrov.
How can you use cheese in garden design?
The questions are answered by Irina Okukunwa:
Because of its main attractiveness, the cheese has to be planted together with other shrubs.
It has many cultures to do with it.
It is possible and necessary to plant plants that are ornamental at other times as well as flowers that bloom at the same time.
Another plus siren is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can make it a strain tree of various heights, enhanced with a bush, a bush with a broad base, and even a likeness of a garden pine tree with a enchanted sling.
Just select the shape that fits your garden design.
A Leningrad resident in the Leningrad region was convicted of selling counterfeit money in Karlia
According to the republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, a man was engaged in his criminal activities in Olontsk and Ségeja districts.
In addition to Kareliya, he has committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in following up in the Voloda region, where he was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment in the spring of this year.
The man was later brought before the Olonsky District Court.
To complete the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was initiated in Segejo.
The investigation proved guilty of several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money relating to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of this year, the criminal case was brought before the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court decided to replace the term of deprivation of liberty for a period of four years with that of a general regime colony.
The verdict did not enter into legal force.
Remember, during the past week, two more counterfeit sellers were convicted of paying them at Petrozazzewska’s store.
Azerbaijani nationals also traveled to Kareliya from St. Petersburg.
One of them has been deprived of liberty for five years, and the other one for four years.
Each fine is fined 500,000 roubles.
The verdict has also not yet entered into legal force.
In Archangelsk, we celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first horse, Derwish.
The rally, which was held in the regional centre, was dedicated to the first Arctic horse.
Derwish delivered military aid from the United States and Britain to the USSR.
In the Archangelical Memorial, a future monument was held on the sideboard of Sedov in Solombal.
The meeting was attended by representatives of Veterans ' organizations, Archangelska, children of the Cadet class.
For the first time, we met twenty-three years ago when the stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a celebration, but a day of remembrance of those who have not been returned to the sea,' noted Boris Karpov, president of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Sea Powder.
Then the city’s spiritual orchestra spoke, and the students of the Cadet classes gave the veterans flowers and marched with the Russian flags and the victory mark.
The rally ended by placing flowers on the stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of uniform boots, tin, wool, and numerous other inventory and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were carried on board, with 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harrikain fighter aircraft in disassembled condition.
At the same time, 16 British VMVs were an express of the convoy, of which two were aircraft carriers.
The caravan was not found by the enemy and reached a safe destination by Archangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 were killed and about 50 were killed.

Recalling the very American idea that labour rights are human rights
Congresslors Keith Allison and John Lewis have proposed a bill protecting the organization of trade unions as civil law.
"Where trade unions are, there are jobs at the middle class," says Allison, a Minnesota democrat who co-chairs the Congress of Progressive Faction.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Act on Employee Empowerment along with the symbol of the civil rights movement John Lewis.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunities in the context of discrimination against trade union organizations as other forms of discrimination by halting the forces of opponents of trade unions
The amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act to enable workers facing discrimination in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in civil courts and to receive compensation for damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis, and the drafters are offering is to remember a very American thought.
Despite attacks by trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that would be remembered by millions of Americans when that country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his associates helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that the paramilitary autocracy of Hideki Tojiu had been replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in the formation of the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate and to act collectively is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that the Fascism of Adolf Hitler had been replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that said: “The right to form associations to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to everyone and to every profession or profession.
Agreements which restrict or seek to infringe this right will not have legal effect; measures aimed at that purpose will be considered illegal.
When the former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which had drawn up the World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948 would be adopted by the Organization of United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the constituents included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his or her interests”.
By generations, Americans have adopted a proper basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to establish civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions and that the union should participate as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government agencies should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and that their voices be heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Junior said fifty years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Everyone now knows that the movement of trade union has not undermined the power of the nation, but has increased it.
Building the standard of living of millions, trade unions have miraculously created a market for industry and raised a whole nation to an incomprehensible level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers us too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are restoring ideals that historically expanded America and made democracy a reality.
A judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the implementation of the law of Louisiana, which his supporters say would probably close all five State abortion clinics.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Luiziana Bobby Gindell in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, the doctors who have abortions would have been obliged to receive the patients at the hospital within a radius of 30 miles from their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision meant that to date doctors could continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such powers.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work lawfully, continuing to receive full powers”, wrote Judge John de Grevells in his judgement.
The hearing will be scheduled for a month on which the judge will render a more permanent decision under this law.
The advocates of the right to abortion were happy to meet this decision, the latest decision against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.
“The current decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from a law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights”, said Nancy Northap, President and Head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed a complaint against the suspension of the law from the face of three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately apparent whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the case and whether they had also applied for admission.
Louisiana is a member of the 11 States that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Missouri.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetricians and gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that laws on admission powers impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary in terms of medical care.
Abortors objected that such measures were intended to protect women ' s health, although some also noted their positive effects in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who commits abortions in Louisiana has the authority to take care of a hospital, and reported to the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other state doctors were to stop the procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop the procedure, reported to the team.
In criticism of this decision, the officials of Louisiana said that they would not punish abortion doctors while their decision-making powers were pending.
Targeting the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of trade networks should be Russian production, and considered Oleg Nilov as a member of the "Justy Russia" faction.
The parliamentarian prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writing the newspaper Izvetia.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This is the case for goods not produced in Russia; in the rest of the products produced in Russia, the Rythyler will have to provide at least half of his regiment to domestic producers,” reported Nilov.
Together with the amendments to the article on the basics of State regulation of trade in the Russian Federation, the bill provides for the amendment of the Tax Code to establish a 10 per cent lower VAT rate in the production of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is a package of stimulus measures for Russian producers.
There will be several times the number of domestic products available at the docks.
However, experts say that the initiative can have both positive and negative effects.
According to counsel for Taxouk, a member of the Public Duma Independent Expert Centre, Sergei Litwinko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, will have a positive effect and lead to growth.
It's going to turn out to be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means profit will grow.
They will also have the right to dictate to the Ryrilers their terms and prices, as they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, leading to higher taxes than before.
This will increase the income of the budget, create new jobs, some industries will start growing, some faster, contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will be reduced several times, truth, not immediately,” notes the expert.
Russian enterprises had often been unable to shop for local stores because of the high competition on the part of foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been released and can be given a fresh breath.
But it should not be forgotten that food supplies from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be delivered after all the necessary arrangements and sanitary checks on the Russian market.
In other words, now is the moment of the dark, when the previous players are gone and the others are still here.
“Almost a month later, one might speak of increased demand for domestic raw materials as well as rising prices for finished products”, said AIF.ru, First Vice-President of the General-Russian Public Organization, Russia’s Club of Financial Directors, by Tamara Casianova.
Of course, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food items in each category would strengthen the sector for local producers.
In such a case, they would compete with each other rather than with goods that were worth more than goods from subsidies from another State.
In other words, the buyer's struggle will be fought between companies operating under the same industry's laws.
On the other hand, notes Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of the compatriots in very little way.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to carry a proportion of Russian goods to half the range.
There are therefore growing fears that poor goods will be added to the counters.
Perhaps foreign products containing overeating labels will be supplied to Russia,” adds the expert.
Major trade networks, especially those that benefit from cooperation with importers, have a negative impact on quota implementation.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by this pattern, as the demand for their products will be reduced.
Lithuanianenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods could affect consumers as well.
The point is that some of the products of the Russian production can be treated as imported analogies, whereas shops will be able to push the prices of the second, as if they were a deficit.
The idea of imports of imports in the early 2000s was reiterated by economists in February this year because of the continued devaluation of the rouble.
In view of the difficult relationship with the West, the issue of the non-importation of imported products is now becoming more pressing.
The law is intended to require rynilers to treat suppliers with domestic producers when making orders.
Then we will go much faster and more confident on the way of imports, and the production planning system will be established in a shorter time,” said Deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where capacity is particularly high, for example in the milk industry, where the share of imports is 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to cover the entire counterbox of Russian shops.
Meat production can also gain a strong pulse.
The largest share of imports is known to remain for beef, from 30% to 35%.
In fact, 65 to 70 percent of them are Russian products,” Kasiyanova explains.
The experts were of the view that quotas for domestic products facilitated imports and could accelerate this process.
However, this initiative will not in itself be replaced, as it requires a set of measures, sure Lithuaniainko.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative could still be imported from abroad, and thus there would be no full import, but significant steps would be taken in that regard.
In addition, quotas had to be established, and domestic production was still needed to implement those quotas.
These quotas are such guarantees and will provide them," notes the expert.
Not timely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment means that more ovarian cancer in rural areas kills
Angeline Jolly and her brother James published a video of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Rural Australian women face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than urban women.
The researchers analysed maps of the disease of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed as “cancer of ovaries” in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent had lived five years after the diagnosis had been issued.
The leading researcher, Susan Jordan, from the QIMR Bergofer Institute of Medical Studies, reported that the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote areas of the state than for those living in urban areas.
THE NEAR RESEARCH: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer.
The researchers had followed the medical path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, current diseases and socio-economic status also affected survival.
Older women and those with cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecological oncology, and they're mostly in the big cities," she said.
Despite improvements in the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of services available for visiting, which would allow professionals to treat women closer to home, and programmes to support people receiving treatment far away from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tino Reid to Conquer Counter will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank, Elyse Niv, said she had aggressive forms of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open the door in the Kugenir district.
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Tokquibelak began in April this year and was conducted on a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Office of Public Relations and Information, Chapter Marius El, the construction of the facility was financed from the Republic's budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of a built-in preventive institution is almost 230 square metres.
The eight towns will be treated here: the village of Tokibelak and the village of Dementiavo, Puncherulal, Tunja, Fomić, Torybeliak, Shinar and Chakahal.
The new health centre will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources and its facilities do not meet the sanitary requirements.
The new institution will soon be launched.
Killing a four-month-old son in a state of untribe, a new child will be tried
A Cumashii woman will be found guilty of murdering her own child.
In Cheboxach, a criminal investigation was completed against a 31-year-old woman in Novocheboksarska, accused of causing death due to negligence.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year the accused, together with the four-month-old son, arrived to celebrate the birth of the child in Cheboxara.
After a long stop, the new baby decided to stay with the guests and make the baby sleep.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, the handless woman placed it next to her bed to feed her breast but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, the woman attacked her son, leaving him dead with suffocation.
Criminal case, reporting to the SCR press service on Chuvashiya, sent to court.
Inflation is out of leave.
Does Russia feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of cross-border sanctions, the inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not be reflected in the projections of the authorities, and are convinced of the “WTB Capital” analyst.
In the opinion of the experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions would lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writing to BBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast, in 2014, the inflation rate was 6.5 to 7.5 per cent, and in the following year the rate was 6.5 per cent.
However, according to the newspaper Commersante, this week the IED is expected to make a “small but fundamental” adjustment to the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can reduce inflation estimates for 2015 to eliminate expected incomes.
It was predicted that the FM food sanctions were in effect for a year, until August 2015.
How could such inflation be supposed to be so high?
The current situation involves a one-off shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change," said a newspaper source in Minsk.
Economists from the VTB Capital do not share Government's expectations of inflation in the financial and economic bloc and predict a price increase of 8 per cent in 2014.
Experts are convinced that the main impact of the food bans will be along with the possible introduction of a sales tax (SNP) in 2015 in the regions.
The 9 per cent inflation peak will be February, followed by annual price increases, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat gave the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed “circular sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed the experts and clarified their inflation expectations.
Artem Daev, head of FC Analysis Department, AForex:
Price increases are already being observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when goods of social significance were valued, the Government had to launch a system-wide monitoring of price stability to prevent the risk of undue price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and ryrilers are already reporting to regulators on a daily basis, so that the authorities will know exactly who, when and for what reason, initiates price increases.
The enormous capital outflow rates, the over-finance of the banking sector by the Russian braver, the internal conversion due to the foreign-currency movement of the population and the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have acceded to sanctions against Russia remain key factors in the growth of the consumer price index.
If the inflationary pressure remained under control, the cost of the minimum package would not have jumped 12 per cent in just a quarter.
The prohibition on food imports had caused a shock in the domestic market and had led to a very logical increase in final value.
As we are not able to fully launch the import mechanism at this stage, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the counter-action sanctions will continue to carry the risk of inflation growth.
By adding the fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in national currency, as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Razaev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
Inflationary sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month in the 1990s, zero was also higher than the current level, another matter that was then offset by rapid economic growth.
By the end of the year, I think inflation will be 8 to 8.5 per cent.
Plato Mahut, who manages the KK assets, "The Foundation of Magut"
The external factor associated with the sanctions against Russia is thus far being held back, but if further pressure is increased, especially on the financial sector, it may lead to certain difficulties and inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally displayed in the purchase of cash currency to secure their savings.
It may be assumed that the Government, the FMC and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth reduction of rubella, both by market methods and by public regulation.
But prices start traditionally after summer's dark, and perhaps this fall will be more tangible.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is 7.5 per cent likely to survive, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centres mourn the decline in the number of homeowners
Such a fall, resulting from an exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners below 35 years of age, may result in the loss of tens of millions of pounds by horticultural centres each year when today's youth consumers reach the “core age of horticulture”, according to HTA study reported by Financial Times.
According to this report, people who remove housing spend, on average, 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in high-prefabricated areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalt in front of a parking home and the decline in the size of a garden as other factors threatening the industry, with an estimated annual sales of 5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61% to 43% in six years, the U.K. spends the lowest on household goods.
HTA and Royal Gardening Society reported that renting and lack of garden space did not mean that humans could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief horticulture adviser to RHS, said, "The growth of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move."
HTA reported a period between 1997 and 2005 as a “golden century” of retail goods trade for gardening resulting from an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year through better weather following the adverse conditions of March and April of last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria conducted a mass cleaning in the Earthdelela Foundation.
Three of the four heads of the Earthdeldell Foundation were replaced by another Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Landwell Foundation were replaced by another Friday.
The official Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only that the Executive Director, Atanas Hajva, had been removed.
His place was Lauzan Vassil.
On Friday, two of the three executive directors of the fund appeared to have changed.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatian Angelov, who had previously been responsible for public assistance and the SAPARD programme, has been released, reports BGEES with reference to the newspaper Trud.
I didn't attend the Board of Governors of the Foundation because we weren't legally members of management, but they told me later that I had been released.
I cannot tell you why my dismissal is not reported on the Fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I know more on Monday," said Angelov's publication.
Her place would be Ivanka Bagdanov, who was still the head of Investment Credit at the central fund at Landowner's in Sofia.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nikolai Dachev, was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for the EU fields.
He will be appointed to the seat of Zivingo Zivickov, who was head of the District Directorate of the Earthdeldell Foundation in the city of Vio-Tyrnikovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the Atige Alieva-Weli Foundation has retained his post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls a United States diplomat in connection with a report on spying
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has summoned the highest American diplomat in the country to explain the report on the American and British spyage in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Bulent, reported that the United States attorney in cases and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German journal Der Spiegel and the Internet-based magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by the former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden indicated that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for United States and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Regep Taip Erdogan, President of Turkey, diminished the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were spying behind each other.
Previously reported information that Germany ' s main intelligence agency had also made Ankara an object of exploration, had generated a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
China's largest companies have united against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including the China’s largest business real estate, the Dalian Wanda Group, and the Tenent Holdings Internet Leagues (secrets, Messinger et al.) and Baidu (most Chinese search), have set up a company that will compete on the market with Alabama.
But to catch up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which even left its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com, will be difficult.
Union of the Major
Companies are planning to invest 5 billion Yuan ($ 814 million) in a joint venture, 70 per cent of it is owned by Wanda and 15 per cent by each Internet company, according to Wanda Group.
It is planned to register a firm in Hong Kong.
The PO will integrate the Baidu search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest social network in China, with a user population of about 438 million), Tenent and the Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 state-of-the-art hotels, the Wanda group manages at least 49 commercial properties throughout China and 40 commercial centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a thematic entertainment park in Qindao (a city in eastern China on the coast of the Yellow Sea).
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring profits at $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American Network of AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the world's largest camera operator.
By 2015, Wanda planned to equip all its commercial centres, hotels and places of entertainment with e-comprece services, which will be further developed with the development of an Alibabaa competitor.
According to Dun Tse, who will lead a new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-compense services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by the following year.
The new platform should become the largest platform in the world on line-to-offline, notes Dun Tse.
The whole point on line-to-offline (O2O) of commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet to come in on-line or to buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sale of coupons such as Groupon or Vogoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest pie in the online company," said Wanda Wan Jianlin (the Bloomberg Citate).
"There is no current O2O site in China today, and in this situation the chances are approximately equal," he believes.
The Chinese market for Internet trade is the largest market in the world, and McKinsey & Co. is estimated to be more than tripled by 2015 than by 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, producing the Bloomberg official statistics: this is more than the population of any country, except India.
And it is projected that by 2015 that number could rise to 850 million.
Union of the Rich
The head of Tenent Ma Huaten was, until recently, the richest person in China, but according to the Bloomberg millionaire index, the founder of Aliba Jack Ma had already lost it by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's status is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is due in Alabama.
The head of Badu Robin Lee is now ranked third among China’s richest people, whereas Van Jianlin of Wanda, fourth line.
"In this battle, it is very interesting to see three of the richest people working together to challenge the more rich," said Bloomberg, director of the Chinese Electronic Commerce Research Centre in Hanzhou Tsao Lae.
But he believes that the new company will not be able to compete seriously with Abiba as soon as it is created, "It can't be built in one day."
The fact that, with Abiba, it is not so – simply to compete with new companies, but also with well-deserved leaders of the world’s Internet trade, is clear from the previous report on Alabama’s financial performance in the last quarter.
Abibaa is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, a Chinese company earned more than both its American competitors combined.
The net profits of Alibaba over a period almost double the same set of competitors - it increased almost threefold in annual terms, to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has enormous potential for generating money, largely because of its mobile applications," commented Bloomberg on a report from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba's updated outlook on the United States Price and Exchange Commission's website, the company's active mobile service users were 188 million in July, considerably above the March figure (163 million).
At the same time, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba ' s transactions during the last quarter involved mobile devices.
Alibaba should be described as the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 Bloomberg analysts, the company could be estimated at $187 billion after sales.
According to the Bloomberg sources, the debut of Alabama on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could be held on 16 September.
Road show the company that preceded this event will start on 3 September.
It is expected that Alibaba's exit to IPO will be a record in the NYSE history and allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the United States exchange record was due to the Visa payment system, which settled its shares in 2008 with a value of $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food items in the trade networks should be Russian production, and members of the State ' s Parliament may be considered.
They have drafted a bill on this subject.
These are changes to article 8 of the FI and the Code of Taxes.
The aim of the document is to provide protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 per cent of the products of domestic production in shops should be for each type of product.
However, the document will bear in mind that there are items that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruit in the winter, so that they will be given a “skin” to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft Act also amends the Code of Taxes, which establishes a 10 per cent low rate of VAT for all food items of Russian origin, reports the newspaper Isovesia.
On 27 August, a draft law was introduced into the lower House of Parliament to amend the FO “On retail markets”, which proposes to re-establish in Russia farmers' markets where small producers can carry out their products.
A corruption charge against the Police Chief of Magalouf
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Kalvia at the Malorka State Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Kalvia in Malorca resort was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and barowners at the scandalous drinking centre of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of allegations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street where the majority of the bars and night clubs of Magaluf are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's daily online launch, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by the police officers and officials of the Kalvia municipality at the Malorka Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by National Guards of Spain on charges of corruption and the judge will be interrogated together with Navarro.
The Spanish daily edition of ABC reported that disgruntled night club owners say protectionism on the part of the authorities seriously affects the state of their business.
"The decision is no longer to make money, it's to survive," said one of the businessmen.
Our sources of existence must not be compromised.
There's nothing to lose.
Magaluf came into the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing a 18-year-old British recuperator who washed 24 men while running at bars.
The island authorities have since tried to stop scaffolding among the relaxing Magaluf, minimizing the number of notorious alcohol runners at bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where a mine incident occurred, had to close for a year, while Playhouse and Carnage’s organizers had been fined for €55,000 ($73,000).
Magaluf's tourist resort, mainly popular among young British vacationers, was also the scene of numerous accidents in alcohol-related activities associated with foolish entertainment, known as balconing, when people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the living pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Aeroport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in southern Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide’s Aeroport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the town by 9 p.m., after 6.6 mm, which fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short downpours, including a storm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and spilled nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter gave early spring production last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
School conditions are believed to have contributed to the delay in the landing of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it hit the wind-shift zone - the sudden change in speed or the direction of the wind at a short distance - and was forced to gain height.
The winds were as high as 50 km/h on earth at the Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight showed that the aircraft had to gain height during the second landing, and the aircraft finally landed around 8:40 a.m.
The delay in the voyage caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates from Dubai and the Qantas from Sydney.
Maximum of 16C is projected at Adelaide on a Tuesday with a probability of one or two torrential rains.
Calculation of estimates of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The Federal Antimonopoly Service has special control over issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry and networking.
The FAS has set up an expert board for building competition.
At its meeting, the head of the JCH control, construction and natural resources office, FAS Wadim Solovev, stated that “the calculation of estimates of construction facilities is completely incomprehensible”.
The regulatory framework makes pricing improbable and can lead to an unreasonable price of construction, they say in the FAS.
And they suggest that the cost of the construction of guest facilities at the design stage should be determined on the basis of the market prices of constructive decisions rather than today ' s estimated rules and the unit cost of technological operations.
These proposals have been made in the road map and are now under consideration in the mine.
“The replacement of traditional estimates in construction to the calculation of design elements should result in less corruption in the industry,” explained Vadim Solov.
It is now estimated that every bolt and nut is included in the estimates, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, unfair construction companies may bury a “whole tractor”.
In the past, FAS agrees.
“The initial work on the conversion to the cost of construction is already under way: methodologies for calculating the price for the design decisions and preparing the estimates for these indicators are developed,” said the GTB Chief of Urban Management and the architecture of the Jelena Zhukov mining department.
The road sector has been selected as a pilot.
The experts, however, believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to Profi-Investy construction director Anatoly Damianco, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but no other business mechanism has yet been proposed.
“As regards the proposed design calculations, it is difficult in practice because the construction of buildings often employs very different technologies”, he said.
It's no secret that the construction is developing in a lot of the public services.
In the view of the Chairman of the NP Board, Ekaterina Lezina, the “Expert Community of Professional Hospitals”, the State today is the most able employer to pay.
The Under-Secretary of the Industrial Capital Construction Centre, Rasatom Vladimir Malach, drew attention to the fact that the market today is divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts, and companies with monopoly and no competitors.
He considered that the establishment of a transparent market was possible only if access to contracts was maximized by anyone's influence.
The expert board had been asked to establish a hospital system in such a way that the same executive could not obtain more than one contract worth more than 1 billion roubles or several contracts worth more than 1 billion roubles.
In mining it is believed that this approach should be assessed in terms of the impact on business as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukov explained, in this case it will be necessary to give the customer the functions of a contractor, resulting in an increase in the customer ' s staffing and budget costs.
Customer specialists will, however, have to know how to measure the quality of work performed by contractors and their safety.
Often, this breakdown will require identification of who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach could lead to the outflow of highly skilled participants in the hotel owing to the lack of interest in obtaining a government order for part-time work and the small amount of the contract.
The Heads of the Procurement Research and Advisory Centre, Alexander Eustasykov, are of the view that the process of hospitality has now turned into a business game of diligence on the part of the contractor.
And he cited it as follows: “A party, when filling out the application, must indicate “specific indicators” without specifying the words: “or equivalent”, “be”, “be”, “be greater”, “behe”, “less,” “analog”, “or”, “typs,” “not below,” “low”, “below,” “may”, “may have”, “may be”, “not be”, “not earlier”, “not above”, “not allowed”, and so forth.
Therefore, employers often abuse their right to impose requirements for the content of an application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ considered that it was necessary to assess the quality of work at the time of application through the participant's “paper” proposal.
When considering the applicant, it is realistic to assess only the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been done, the expert believes.
The quality of work can only be estimated when it is accepted.
At the expert board, it was also suggested that the cost-of-living income from the top to the lower echelon be transferred to the intermediate contractors.
The Chairman of the Council of Experts, the State Secretary, the head of FAS, Andrey Kingsowski, is of the opinion that this is not worth the task, as the supervisor must be responsible for the task.
Or it'll work, like, in the famous Rykina respirator, "Atel," "There is a claim with the buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories close to the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday, following the bombing in the shelters, when missiles and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the Territory recovered from the fighting.
The commencement of school classes brought joy and excitement to southern Israeli settlements affected by missiles, but the signs of fighting remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the Paschosh Children's Garden, which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of wall cracks and slabs of children's mountains before the pupils arrived.
"We're a little afraid, but we're happy to look into the future," said Ronnie Bart, a Kybussa Saad woman and an English teacher at his school.
Many of the children in our area really need to return to a life of magnitude.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly she was going back to school "a little weird."
"There was a difficult time and we didn't get out of our homes," she said.
President Raven Rivlin visited the Kibutz, which is located near the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the cease-fire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, did not go out or leave their homes, fleeing to safer areas away from the Gaza Strip to escape from the missile and mortar fire.
Many of the inhabitants of Nahal Oz, settlements near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine break, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu went to school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was greatly affected by the Palestinian fire.
He told the children to study diligently and said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite Truce last Tuesday.
The cease-fire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as the request by Hamas to lift the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and to open airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of the two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
A new phase of proximity talks is expected to commence later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, of which three quarters were civilians and at least 494 were estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
The Israeli side killed 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazaan fighters fired 4,591 rockets and mines on Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, in the meantime, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged and destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip, and an estimated 250,000 people have sought refuge in more than 100 schools, which have been transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fighting continued, educational officials postponed the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open up so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohamed Amar, a 13-year-old boy who lives in one of Gaza's schools.
According to the popular property price criterion, real estate has shown the largest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Housing Index for housing prices in the Australian capital grew by 1.1 per cent in August, and reported the RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a total increase of 4.2 per cent for June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice that of 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lowes reported that Sydney and Melbourne are running a two-tier market.
The figures for the RP Data show that in Sydney housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent over the last year, while in Melbourne the price for housing rose by 11.7 per cent.
The next market power was Adelaide, Brisbein, and Darwin, where prices averaged between five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government cost cuts were undertaken, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Loules said that now, when spring began, there would be an increase in the number of real estates put on sale over the next few months, which would be a “true test” for the market.
"In view of the current high rate of auction sales, the total high sales speed and current conditions with a low interest rate are likely to increase the cost of housing in the next three months," he said.
How People Live in the Oldest House of Ufa
In the former home of the gold industry and mining men, Eudocim and his son, Ivan Demidov, through the streets of the October Revolution 57/11 (former Grand Kazanski), 18 apartments.
The houses of the 18th century since the construction of the building have remained virtually unchanged, apart from its edifice.
Foreign people walk here as a tour, and the residents suffer more than they delight, from their privilege of living in an old U.S. house, the wall of which is remembered by General Alexander Suvorov.
The date of house building is not accurate, historians indicate two dates: 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out it's a 300-year-old building.
Old court, open the door, violin stairs.
The doors in the apartment are close to each other, the walls are broken, and the streets are visible in the light of a falling plaster.
I think I'm holding it up straight.
And the locals believe, "You don't think it is."
Living in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult,
The site is in the public domain, but it doesn't make money for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have simply forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still sloppy, but the foundations are gone.
Many residents still go to the bathroom and pray once a week in a public bath.
How happy we can be under such circumstances!
The road goes straight under the windows, not even the pedestrian zone.
Tatiana's putting away the curtain.
Now you can see that you have only heard before, and there is a traffic under the windows.
You see, the glass is always combing, and the windows can't open, but they're used to noise.
Man is used to everything, to good and bad.
Our apartment is yet a model, thank you husband, his hands are gold.
Meanwhile, we have two rooms with three with a son.
And other families have a much worse environment, and on the second floor of the ceiling, the ceiling is just over a foot and a half.
To contrast Tatiana suggests visiting a neighbor at apartment No. 6 Ludmila Startyna.
A nice guest lady from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and a sad smile says,
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live with my husband and daughter and her granddaughter.
I've been here since birth, there's never been any other housing, and Ludmila's eye-browsing room is an interssols, two strange letters of "g," and one of them is a laptop granddaughter.
Very closely and slightly different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But the stream regularly flows through the flow: there is no food available for the running water system.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment as a common and surprising thing at the same time as an Italian woman whose house is on Roman ruins.
I mean, it's one of the very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water pipeline took place some 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they gave us a little kitchen in a lockup and a toilet from the ex-heard.
We live just where David’s family and his apartment were located, where servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, so why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Center, they say that privatization doesn't matter.
We'll only get one room, we can't claim more.
It's been four months ago that we were promised to settle down, but it didn't go away.
I'm not used to complaining, nor will I.
My grandmother and grandfather, my mother and dad, me and my husband and my daughter with their granddaughter.
Everything's been going on since then.
For example, healthy rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls, they're a meter thicker than that!
They say the solution was on the eggs, so it's been holding on for so long.
The house is solid, thank you Demetdov!
That's probably why no one has ever been killed by a broken ceiling or by their own.
Only the building still slowly dies in front of us — the planks and logs of our house rot, the women fall apart repeatedly, the cementing of the floor, but it's all useless, the solution goes down like a well.
They say it's under our room, under a hidden loop, and going to the White River, which made it a special place to live here once a team, so that you can hide from danger, in which case.
They were persecuted.
Ludmila Startina tells us how a historian came to visit them, and she begged him to start digging in the apartment.
And then I persuaded them to give them their vestry in exchange for my little one in the October Avenue.
Sophia's historian refused to say,
Where are we four in the same room?
And there's even a tiny hope here that they're going to give shelter more space.
We've agreed for an exchange, nothing to win.
Well, the Oldman family hasn't won anything.
Ludmila's greatest dream was to be settled, and a daughter with a 16-year-old girl gave her own room.
That is, two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations now live.
A pretty, miniature girl named Olésha Karsakova, from apartments Nos. 11 and 12, shows the second floor of the house.
There, her large family lives in two close rooms of a total of 23 m2, called apartments.
Seven of us, two of us.
You can see the conditions.
The windows, windows, windows, windows, and windows are cut into the kitchen and in the rooms through through holes.
The water in the tap is only cold for a year.
As you walk through the apartments of Ufa's oldest home, you can see that the more fortunate it was for Lavrent's wives from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the outermost rooms of the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
A 75 square space, three people are listed.
We live right in those rooms where the legend is to stop Suvorov while he was in Ufe, says the head of the family of Alexander Dmitrevic Lavrentiev.
The ceilings are tall, simple.
One bad thing -- everything around the seams, breaks, goes down.
The neighbors must have already told us!
We've got the most torment with floors: wooden planks rotted, and the earth was literally out of the way.
I put the plugs, the wedges; there's nothing else in the room; there's nothing in the other room, and we go, as we're rolling, so much of it.
The house of the merchant Evdockim Demidov Alexander Dmitriewic can tell a better guide than any other guide.
The gold industry is like a native, and it's beautiful.
Indeed, the identity was indistinguishable: the owner of Kaginsk and Uzian factories built houses, carried off guns and bellies, and held the Ural mines.
The heirs of the purchase estate are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I lived here as a child, in the 1940s, when Alexander Dmitrevic said.
There were wooden carriages, stables, and slabs around the corner, which were later removed.
In 1968, we also wanted to clean up our house, but something stopped...
The story was repeated in 2014, and new housing was again introduced.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, ran out of the necessary offices, and suddenly learned that the move was carried to the apartment for 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in all this...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashcortostan to learn about the fate of the home.
The tenants didn't take the tenant.
They were sent from table to table, and then, as a mock, they put up a piece without signature or press: "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the settlement of the tenants."
I even had this feeling that our house was long gone from the city because it was first under number 57, then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's as if it's already been destroyed in the 1970s.
The Russian planet has launched a sector-led information and analysis of the land administration of Weth Vladimir Barbash.
A house on the street of the Revolution of October 57/1 is part of the settlement programme.
I can't take responsibility for the action of officials in the 1970s, but I only know that there was a plan at the time to demolish all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities to rebuild all the old houses on the streets of the October Revolution, which represent architectural value, has been successfully implemented.
Residents are scheduled to settle in new apartments soon.
According to Barabasha, Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of the buildings in Venice will rebuild the House of Demidod.
The architectural binnal is now in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there, among others.
I hope that by 2016, all the former Casana Street will be restored, says the official.
The house will have a proper appearance, corresponding to what it used to be three centuries ago.
Demetdov's house is likely to become a museum open to everyone.
At the governmental level, it was also decided to make the street a weekend pedestrian.
In the building, unfortunately, there's no way too much traffic in the city.
Russell’s future Museum of Vladimir Barbash promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be happy, and their new apartments will be the same area as the present one.
Only from another age.
In Primorje, the storm started a forest fire
The dry storm resulted in a forest fire in the Oath Landing Area in the Pojar district of the Primor Province.
At the scene of the fire, groups of forces and assets are being increased.
According to the management of CSAS, the conditions created at the scene require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasilyy Medvedev, deputy aviation chief:
A fire struck in a difficult area discovered an observer pilot from the A-2 patrol aircraft at an area of 3 hectares.
Woody remains on the old burner are burned.
The deep silencing of the territory and the steep slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of landing-placed firefields, which pose a significant challenge.
We need a MI-8 helicopter.
The delivery of forces at the disposal of aircraft by a Mi-2 helicopter and an An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
Following the detection of the fire, 4 parachutists were quickly planted.
The main task of the experts is fire-fighting and the preparation of sites for the delivery of additional fire-fighting equipment.
In the area of lunch, 3 fire fighters were added to the village area of the Oskotski helicopter.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, the specialists will be moved to the point of dispersal, reporting on the Primor Province Administration site.
My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family in Jamaica in Dadley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19 years old, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses the comedy, Rudy's Rudi Leafs, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from the Radio 4 series.
Saundrek is a mixture of hornes and raps, and melodies are lifeless.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother died, he had a “little” treatment, and he often thought about his father's relationship with him.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you just heard his voice say, "Stay the noise.
Leave your sister.
Move it!
I want to watch the screams.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, walked with him in the pub and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a blow in a scream.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an impetuous guy at the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a leafwork workshop in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in his father’s day, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
It's a little bit better now, but it's dark, smoke-smoker depths with flashes of fire and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father got into the bathroom and was just lying there, and you heard him sing slowly about himself, because he wanted to get away from the calf workshop.
When I went there, I realized that he had been doing this for years and years to earn us a living, and I had come to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry came out of her childhood with a lack of parental love.
My father never hugged you, never said, "I love you."
Only when my mom got sick at the end of her life did we start to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Franch, allowed him to share the love that he lacked in his childhood.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don Frich.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mother.
They're still great friends with French who married him 25 years old.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mother.
Henry’s mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I'm very, very well, and I've got the symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
At that time, I began a serious exercise with pitens, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of my symptoms.
It's really hard.
That's boring.
No one's eating carrots.
Henry's career path shift is perhaps reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he's been criticized for his Otello, he's been fully caught in the theater.
She followed the Comedy Errors, and then Ogasta Wilson.
This work is different from that of the sites and comedys, who were an integral part of his rich professional life.
He started a career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ saw him go on stage and write about him in The New Persons.
His career on television began in the mid-70s: "I've been the only black shepherd/comotive on television for a long time."
He went to work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I had to learn to be an effective machine for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985 as a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny's "New Persons" in 1975
Since his manager had the right to "The Black and White minstrels Show," a light entertainment program in which people "shined their face," Henry discovered that he had been doing it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I think it's never meant to be with me, but I'm not sorry to do it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked in large areas and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was known as the "light entertainment award on British television for years and years" was the "grotesque parody on black people."
Representing the characters who used to ridicule the culture of blacks in the United Kingdom and winning it, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of "Wo Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and he was known as Chief Gareth Black, of the "Shef" comedy series.
Advertising, documentary films, television series, and his role in movies took the next ten years of his life, but after he had a BBC series in 2008, LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because a little feels like you're pulling a little bit of time or a little bit of a turn aside."
And then there was a series of documentary programs on Radio 4 called "What's the good at...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had real allergies on Shakespeare.
You can't tell me that I was taught it so much at school, and I thought it was, to a large extent, the prerogative of middle-class white people with ringes and kales on the bottom.
So I was very afraid of him.
All we interviewed for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't swear that until you know what you're talking about.
Keep some of those words out loud, and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines out of Otello's last monologue for documentary transmission, and got stuck.
I feel like I can do this.
It was like my head had been rectified.
"That's what this is, this is a serious matter, taking this seriously, teaching your text, conducting a little study.
So, the tutoring process was tough, and I've been reading this play for months and months before we set it up.
And she was successful.
It seemed as if they were waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
We soon started "Medical Errors."
Suddenly, I was in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the public.
"The quiet voice inside me said, "You have to work 10 minutes while they do the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume once the problem had been resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else figure it out.
"You play the play, stay in the play."
Henry's in the Zabories at Dachez Theater.
It was difficult to learn the text for the Voters.
The panic is pretty useful, it strengthens the musculature.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign above, saying, "What do you have to do?"
He says that, of course, by his voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really do love it.
I love being in the tutoring room.
By the way, Henry's still thinking about a comedian -- the whole road to our conversation is to stop the outbreaks of his humor when he starts, he's finished to parlour.
I just decided not to work in a bench because this thing, with an instant reward from a complete room of strangers, I think, is quite dangerous.
If you keep trying to do this, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work at the Apollo Plumbing when I want to, but mostly I don't get the same pleasure as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll give the fairway a ride some day.
The pleasure of sitting in a room with a director to help shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I'll ever want to give up that.
So it's a new reality?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice party.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers government officials to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya started biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payment statement.
Staff members who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid shall be notified in a government statement.
The Government suspected that thousands of people continued to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Keniata promised to reduce corruption in public structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (7700000) per month was lost by paying “invisible” workers and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to be entered into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, by a reporter of BBC Vanyam Chebiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants are to appear within the next two weeks in identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through biometric registration procedures, in a government statement.
Anyone who does not do so without good reason will be removed from the payment statements, as reported therein.
“This procedure significantly contributes to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants and will also be used to clear the payment statement at both levels of the Government, thus putting an end to the problem of the invisible worker,” said Ann Weigur, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Structured Power.
Tens of Turkish police officers have been arrested in connection with a “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “a conspiracy against the Government”, reporting by local media.
The police did not comment immediately on this information.
Of the detainees, 14 high-ranking officers were reported by Hürriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in anti-corruption activities in the past December, which were aimed at reviewing government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and listening to the telephone.
The Turkish President Rejep Taip Erdogan (which was then Prime Minister) identified them as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic Clerk Féthhollah Güllen.
Not All Children Return to School in Ukraine
Most of Ukraine’s schools again opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day has traditionally been a major event for families, and, as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Jacziek has taken his daughter to school.
There he told the journalists waiting for us that not all schools had been opened again, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony was not held at every school on September 1st.
There is no peace sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful heavens.
All Ukraine, a huge one-size-fits-all Ukrainian people ' s front, must fight for the peaceful heavens.
Alexan Pastukhov, the headmaster of the Slawiansk school, where Jaczynac's daughter went, spoke in Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive the knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study is traditionally marked by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons, and giving flowers to their teachers.
Rona Fairhead BBC may have found the kind of head she needs.
It is followed by a graft of glory from the world of banking, media administration and the Tori party's internal sector.
Indeed, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at a consulting firm on global governance, Banin and Co., and continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years when she resigned when a lower-level colleague in Pearson's main company was employed.
Her earnings are said to be approaching 1 million.
Its political rating is also over.
She was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, a former head of BP when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became a Cabinet Adviser.
Her husband is former adviser to Tori.
I used to call the Chairman of the poisoned cup in May.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox within it.
The Board has two orientations: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also the voice of public concern and anxiety when something goes wrong.
It is an almost unattainable dueo that needs a complete radical reform.
However, which new chairman would be at risk of coming, disintegrating and destroying the institution as complex as the Chinese dynasties, if he were to deprive himself of his work in that process.
It's a tough decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC decrease in size, once its mandate, finance and status were reviewed.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge the sedentary old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of a licence pose a particular risk to the BBC.
For a modest amount of ‐145,50 per year, the British are becoming a share in, of course, the greatest media enterprise in the world.
BBC tells a good story: it claims that its results reach 96 per cent of households and are only 40p a day each.
Moreover, Beeb’s popularity is clearly increasing: 53 per cent of the population today supports her against 31 per cent of the 10 years ago.
The mode of viewing and using BBC has changed, and I now get news headlines on a mobile phone and watch the missing programs on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive president - I hope it found him.
Perry, from Texas, says that humiliating tweets were written by someone outside of Texas.
Twitter, from the confirmed accounts of the Governor of Texas, R.R. Perry, on Sunday evening, contained an offensive image of the district prosecutor from the democracies, who is at the centre of the criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
Twitter was later removed and followed by another of Perry's accounts, which decomposed the record.
I just had a tweet published from my account that was written by outsiders.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I took it out," says a later record.
Perry’s assistants did not immediately respond to a request for comments.
Although the records had been downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was actually responsible for publishing the tape.
An earlier twitt contained an imperishable cartoon for the district prosecutor Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who admitted to driving in a state of intoxication in April 2013.
Perry banned the funding of her agency when she refused to resign, resulting in the trial of a large jury in Ostin this month against Perry, a potential candidate for Presidents in the 2016 elections.
"I don't always drive a car in a state of intoxication 3 times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do that, I charge Governor Perry for telling me that."
I'm the most drunk democrat in Texas.
Lemberg did not conduct an investigation involving a large jury against Perry.
They were Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed as a publisher judge.
Perry was guilty and called the charges a political trick.
His strong legal team had asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the governor who had performed his duties longer than anyone in Texas's history was vague, which was contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding by $7.5 million from the state State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis District and is responsible for the prosecution of corruption in the Texas public sector, when Lemberg refused to retire.
Veto made an official complaint by a group of public control with a left-hand view.
The latent of the confirmed account of Perry is often updated -- and sometimes becomes famous.
When Perry came to the fifth party convention in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, he was told that he could leave the game by publishing a tweet with a picture of himself running next to the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina."
Burkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to the "normal state"
One of London's most well-known developers warned that the real estate market in south-east England had "turned back" to normal activity levels.
The house in the capital was the subject of intense demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that a credit bubble would push Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijley, the founder and chairman of the Berkeley elite construction company, said on Monday: “From the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to the normal level of transactions since peak of 2013,” adding that it provided a “stabilized working environment”.
London’s real estate market is ripening during a recession, as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
The city's prices jumped 18.5 per cent in just one year, according to the Land Registry, with an overall average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales.
Average market prices at private, accessible and student schemes Burkeley grew by about one fifth last year, reaching ?423,000 at the end of April.
However, the build-up of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the imposition of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “desirable tax” before general elections in the following May.
Last week, the Fundtons Real Estate Agency of London warned that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced more stringent loan conditions, would also reduce market growth both for real estate transactions and for prices in the second half of the year.
The latest data from Bank of England on Monday showed a fall in the number of approved mortgages in June, with further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its 2015 price projection to 3 per cent based on the fact that real estate prices had begun to decline.
Transactions in the meantime fell a quarter over the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfaire and Kensington, according to WA Elis.
Nevertheless, the demand for homes in the capital has been very beneficial to Burkeley, raising sales above ?2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijley added, "The demand for good design and best positions remained the same, and reflected this, the sales stayed for a period of time."
In June, the company reported selling 3,742 new houses this year before the end of April, almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
The annual return to taxes rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to the previous year, with an income of 18 per cent to -1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pijley reported that the expected income of Burkeley for that year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of the analysts, the profits are expected year after year prior to the payment of taxes of $4,500 million.
The value of the Berkeley shares was maintained on .23.96 a.m. on the London Exchange.
The photos of Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th annual American Film Academy Award.
The pictures of the top actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar Prize, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a directory of another 100 rising stars.
The representative of the Cold Games confirmed that the pictures of Lawrence were real and condemned the hacker for "bygone invasion of personal space."
Access to law enforcement agencies will be followed by anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photographs originally posted on the 4-chan photo exchange site were suspected to have been obtained due to a lack of an online storage system for Apple iCloud, and the alleged "creature" of the victims includes the names of a dozen feminities, including Renana, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary-Kayt Olsen, according to BuzFed.
It's not clear how many of these photos are real, although Scott Pilgrim's star vs. Winstead's also condemned the hacking of Twitter.
"The one who looks at the photos that we and my husband took with him a few years ago when we got together at home -- I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winsted in Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice of the Nickolodeon series and Victoria winner denied that she was in the photos, wrote in Twitter, "These are the so-called photos of my naked FALSWIKY, the people.
Let me stop it in an ugly way.
Buzfeeded reported last Sunday that Ariana Grande's pop-star representative denied that the photos on which she was supposed to be real were.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's new love novel, and "J", which commended critics
They've dissolved, the best way to say it is, they're slowly falling down like a potato box that's been left under the rain.
Only at times did a woman tell him that he was too serious, heavy in social relations, tense, closed and perhaps somewhat irritated.
And then she shakes his hand.
He saw himself angry.
It was as thorny as an animal, yes.
The last victim of this raffle was a little novel from which he was expecting more than usual relief from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a trembling, fragile beauty with broken hair and trembling hearts from a northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Royben.
She came south with a companion above herself, whom Kevin considered to be a aunt, and she inherited a raw but paradiselike valley called "Ray Valley".
Nobody's been in the house for years.
The strings were flowing, the spiders were constantly sitting in the baths, and the mucus had left their tracks on all the windows, confident that their house was theirs; the garden had grown with weeds that looked like giant kowders.
It was like a children’s book cottage, at the same time frightening and charming, with a complete secret garden.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose J novel is included in the Bucker Award ringer in 2014.
The Street Post will be announced next week.
Kevin and Eileen sat by their hands, in broken slippers among the tall grass, enjoying an unexpected warm spring day; both scatteredly joined the cheap cone, which provided a land with dying music and soothing news, when he looked at her gregarious brown feet, he remembered the old song of a long forgotten black performer, whom his father loved to listen to, dropped the curtains in the house.
You have too big legs.
Because of their violent nature, the songs of this kind on the console no longer lost.
They weren't banned - nothing was actually forbidden - they just didn't lose any more.
They've been helped to become archaic, like the word "archical."
Public tastes of what would never have been achieved by orders and orders, and the same way that people in the books have chosen rich men who have grown up in poverty, cooking books and love novels, they have chosen balsams from all music.
On this afternoon, Kevin decided to play at the image of the piano and the rude coma of Eileen’s large feet.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular jazz song, called Fates Wallace," he told her, putting two fingers on her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the J letter before she took off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was little.
His father played her with his father, as he told him.
Start the word "J" by forgetting to attach two fingers to your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew they were waiting for him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Eileen never heard him.
Jazz didn't play either, even though he wasn't explicitly banned.
The improvisation is out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in my life.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
We're going to be serious, just like that.
His unpredictability worked for people's nerves.
And jazz was acutely expressed through music.
Although he had reached the age of 10 without ever hearing of Sam Davis Maldesh, Kevin was aware of Jazz from a semi-classic CD collection of his father.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fates Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
Society has been obedient, which meant that each segment of it has agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those who have been spared their fate - to the principle of group bias.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were well suited by the heat and physical characteristics for entertainment and sports, and they were singing and running.
Those with Indostan, as if nature were talented in everything electronics were involved, should ensure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was sanitary; what was left of the Greek was a plate.
Those who left the Persian Gulf and Lélanta, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country when someone who SHOULD SHOULD did so in fear of being accused of inflamed with flames, fear of being swallowed up by the fire, fear of being swallowed up by the fire by the following, of opening restaurants with herb and herons, of hanging out and of idleness.
Every one of them is capable.
Since she had heard nothing but bouts before, Eileen found it hard to understand how the abusive words he had just asked her could have been put on music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevin.
Maybe for people with big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but his running garden gave him the illusion of security.
No word could pass through the sound insulation of giant leaves that looked like caps.
Eileen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to push two fingers back at her.
She's already taken him as weird.
"To him it seemed funny," he said instead.
She mistreated her head by closing the review to Kevin.
There was nothing in the world but a scrap of her insular hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying in her mind.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
It seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you because you have fat ankles," he said instead.
I'm so upset.
That sounds wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
His attempts to joke often led him into awkward situations, for, like his father, he lacked the soothing touch that could soften the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevin, wanted to.
Despite good eyes.
Eilenn Solomons got painted and got up from the schillen, threw over the console and spilled the wine they drank.
Wine from the budget, so getting drunk could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
You don't like it, though.
He was sorry for her, and for the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her gaze when she resisted him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She did not talk to him about living in the cold northern Archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that she looked like this in most respects.
The same huge ice ocean hit both of them.
The same men who had been beaten, even more sensitive and moody, after the Powder who SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD than their ancestors, smugglers and robbers, wandered from the pub to the pub, ready to raise their hand against any woman who dared to deny or injure them.
You stupid head?
They'd show her a dumb fist if she wasn't careful!
First, kiss -- kiss now is the most common expression of erotic irritability between a man and a woman; an objection to a fresh ballad that gave the console -- first kiss her and then hit her.
Keverna feels that the explanation is more than just that, because kissing in itself was a hooliganism.
Eilenn Solomons Corps showed him he had to leave.
He got up like an old man.
She felt lead gravity herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she watched him leave, her companion was a man who himself had sprained the pull.
Adam, who is leaving the garden, thought.
She felt compassion for him and men in general, even though some of them raised their hand to her.
A man who turned away from her, with his back bent, hostile, and infuriated, was able to leave him -- why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember no case until today when she saw it?
Once again, one Eileen Solomons looked at his feet.
Twenty years before the events described above or around Esma Noussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in Offnau, an informal public mood control service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and middle levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decline if not entirely, given the means and forces allocated to its eradication.
"It has been done, and much has been done," she wrote, "that to soften the inherent aggression of the people who fought in the thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these confused winds and narrow areas where churches have rowed over the walls, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
However, some of the qualities proved to be inseparable.
The higher the pins, it seems, the lower the passions it creates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental balads, takes stories about the obstacles that have been overcome, and declares its dusty belief in the goodness of marriage and family life, but not only old rudeness remains a strong grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that new and vicious femininity is emerging in homes, workplaces, roads and even on game sites.
"You have the habit of writing too much," said her scholar, reading the report entirely.
I think you should read less novels.
Emmesa Nussbaum put her head down.
I should also ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," Esme Nossbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A Feminist?
Be quiet again.
"I ask," Luther Rabinitz finally said, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensibility, totally acceptable and commendable in themselves, may sometimes distort the results, such as what you showed me.
Obviously, you are prejudiced against the church yourself, and what you call "harmful" and "grubs," others would have interpreted as an expression of natural life and energy.
To keep wondering about the one who SHOULD BELIEF, as if it had happened, if ever yesterday, was to deprive the country of the necessary life force.
Esmee Nussbaum looked around while Rabinitz spoke.
Behind his head, pink letters, such as fleming, were repeated by LED letters, which Ofnau gave the country in the last quarter of the century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your husband, listen to the ball, go to the musicals, talk to him on the phone, talk to him, explain, listen, accept, apologize.
Talking is more quiet, song is better than a written word, but there's nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you mean," Esme Noussbaum replied quietly when she realized that her academic leader had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we're not cured as well as we're convinced of ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we repeat the mistakes that initially led to the TMIC, which has been the subject of the DESA.
Only this time will we throw our anger and mistrust on others.
Luther Rabinitz connected the ends of his fingers in a pyramid.
This gesture should have meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling "error" actions that have committed or have not committed our grandfather's.
You go too far, and when you talk of them throwing their "fire" and "disgusting" into "others."
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that if we understand the past, that is, because we're protecting the present, we're not talking about "us" and "no".
There was no "us" and there were no "others."
It was a riot, that's all we know.
"Who, to be honest with himself," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done was done.
It was then.
We don't have to say anything anymore. We agree here.
And no one should be guilty or excused if it was appropriate or if something could be rectified.
But why the past, if not to learn,
The past thing is that we forget it.
If I can add one word to this,
Luther Rabinitz’s primordium collapsed.
"I'll consider your report," he said, leaving it.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcycle rider who drove on a sidewalk, as passersby described, "in vicious rage."
There's a coincidence.
Lesotho Army states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of the Lesotho Army denied the preparations for a coup to overthrow the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police, suspected of armed with political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabanae left the country, claiming that the country ' s army surrounded its official residence and seized Government buildings in the capital city of Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with attempted life.
The representative of the Army, Major Ntle Ntoi, stated that there was no coup, but that the army was responding to the threat of “political fanatics” that the police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command has taken action, having received several intelligence reports that there are some elements within the police force that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were willing to make chaos”, he told the American Voice.
The representative of the South African Government, Cleison Monjela, stated that the army was like a coup.
"When no one has filed a claim for the takeover of power by force, in all respects, the actions of Lesotho's armed forces to date have the main signs of a coup," he said.
The Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that it was calm in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejo Metsing rules the Government in the absence of the Tubane.
Tabane said he believed that he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been tense since June, when Tabanae suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his united Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government, despite the charges of the contrary.
Marco van Ginkel will spend the coming season on the lease in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutch man will arrive in Italy within the coming hours for a medical examination.
During the past season, he left for a field in London’s club three times.
Recall that in the past, Milan leased the Liverpool attacker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest in 13 months
The growth in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The last value of the Business Performance Index (PMI) of the eurozone industry on Markit fell to mark 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and businesses suffered from growing tensions between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
Values came before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will wait for the bank to have a clear plan on how to cope with the recovery of the eurozone, as well as with a risk of inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
It is believed that the ECB leader Mario Dragi might give further signals later this week, which he is considering a quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on producers becomes more obvious," said Rob Dobson, a senior economist, Markit.
PMI the manufacturing sector of Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the embargo, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a cause for real concern, as does Italy ' s weakening from steady growth to stagnant.
The indications that the momentum for coal growth is mainly from the industrial engine, Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands, also lacks confidence,” said Mr. Dobson.
The slowing down of the industry is likely to still flow oil into the fire to analysts, awaiting additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI has grown to 57.3 at its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said, "The good thing to say about the August study of the Business Performance Index of the productive sector of the eurozone is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: “The eurozone’s producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the present time, as the current increased geopolitical tension — especially with Russia/Ukraine — adds uncertainty to the situation in many countries.
This increased tension has apparently struck business - especially on consumer confidence - and probably leads to delays or even cancellations of certain orders, especially large orders.
He said, "It's more like this," that the ECB will eventually have to spend some kind of quantitative mitigation, "because we suspect it's going to be limited."
The inhabitants of Maraupoli are going to make a living chain against the militias
In Mariopol until last week, things were calm -- no one was trying to organize the Marival People's Republic, a city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
The residents now look forward with horror to the arrival of the “opposers”.
Politicians believe that the separatists break through to Mariopol to go to the Sea of Azov, recently taking the town of Novoazovsk, which had not been part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Marivopols decided that the Ukrainian army would protect them, but she had a little force against the great armed members of the DPR-LNR, and they were going to help the military.
They build trenches, build roadblocks and strengthen.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents arrived at the eastern border of the city, where they found themselves in a living chain, pampering Ukraine’s anthem.
They're going to do the same in case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and fetch equipment and food, collect medicines, produce a newspaper.
Shops are being closed down in the city, and banks and bankers are closing.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: 10 years from the terrible conquest of the school as children in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Bohemian militants at school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children killed during this three-day test, which shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who lied to death during school atrocities.
Just ten years after the terrible conquest of a school in Beslan, at which 334 people were killed, including 186 children who had the heroic experience of a disaster, warned yesterday night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be something of the least possible evil.
The tragedy has united the east and west in an aberration, which has dramatically expanded the hope for the future in the face of the worst tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in the south of Russia to find some of the victims who lied to death during the school atrocities.
We have discovered amazing young people who have fought evil, even though memories of terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now strikes Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
A girl in a photograph trying to get back to a shooting gymnasium.
She was photographed by a famous Russian photographer, Demetrius Belakov, when she tried to get back into the shelled gymnasium after a mine exploded in one laundry.
In her perplexity, Aida desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
They were afraid they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run with all my might, but I couldn't," Aida said then.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After the rest of the operations, she thought she was fully restored, but yesterday she said, "three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more operations.
I've got a few fragments left in my knee.
Her goal now is to be a dentist, to help people the same way that doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but of course she hasn't broken it," she says with a call.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this sports hall to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
It's too much pain.
My best friend, who was to be my classmate, was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we wanted to go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my study and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says her capture stays with her, even though memories get a little tight every year.
I am glad that many people in the world will still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and elsewhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet where I'm looking in the school window, I think many people will see her for the first time, find out about our tragedy, and make sure that it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through hailstones, believing his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (the Russians start school at 7 years of age) and have spent three days taking hold of their mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mother told me to lie down, if there's an explosion, and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Guy."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a weeping baby on the road, grabbed the baby by the hand, and ran through the hailstone.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damyr told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in a hospital with foot injuries, thinking in turn that her son had died.
After they were reunited, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent newspaper, News of the World), where he was rewarded as Protector of the Children from the Barnardo Foundation by Prime Tony Blair and his wife, Shery.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
Still, I can say he's going to be a little bit dull in my memory.
I remember getting rid of all my toy weapons right after that.
But now I can play shooting computer games, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that sports hall, but I don't think of myself.
I remember the kids I played in the yard that never got out.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to pick what I wanted, and drive in a car with an open top.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause so much grief that he and his friends have experienced.
That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Dair, who last week was volunteering in a nun.
I want to help.
I want to serve the police once, and I hope that I will be enrolled in a college next year.
His mother, Tamara, age 48, said, "37 kids were killed in our block, can you imagine?
I remember a terrible silence right after the capture, just there were no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damyr.
The people in London cried when I told our story.
I understood when people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Cheri Blair and her Foundation for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I'd like to call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years has passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember how when Dymir wanted to eat the pot, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waitresses at the restaurant, Damey shot at them from his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it's been only a month since our nightmare that day.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I don't think this world is any better than this 10 year period.
There is now war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think there are many children killed and killed.
They're just children like ours.
I think for many people war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know that these people feel, like, scared of it.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Domir grew up to be a very soft and calm boy, and he's not aggressive or angry.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not a nightmare on this past.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the sports hall from time to time and light the candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it. I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
I didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he dropped out all his weapons and other war toys, 17 now Damira is superior to me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I find it hard to believe that for hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and stand on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell around me while parts of the body lay all over.
I was pretty sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, "Damir, run, run away," but again I was so sure that he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
That's how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
George Ilin, 17 years old
A boy whose shock after his capture became the determining factor for the Beslan tragedy
Peace: Survivor Beslan George Ilin and his mother Fatima after taking over in 2004, and George's case today
His bloodstained face was a print of fear when he was rescued from death when the Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, the chief doctor, took him to school on the first day of his study before moving his older son, Vladimir, to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy stayed one for three days a nightmare," she recalled.
Not exactly one, there was a family of our relatives, but all of them were killed.
Only my Georgia has survived.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's not a day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some of the scenes of these days all the time in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Inhales: The photograph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in sculpture (right)
I remember Georgie so wanted to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now we even have a sculpture of Georgia's weeping in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like looking at this picture, and she's hidden in the book closet at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this picture makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
Georgie now says, "It's important that it never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and are never aware of the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what it was called?
This world is going to be something very bad.
"I can't understand how this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants war, because it happens?
Ten years is nothing for such a pain.
We need to go decades to forget her a little.
It has affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares because of my capture, but now I'm better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I've been thinking about my friends and my classmates who were killed.
That's why I'm still going to this sports hall before 1 September.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won’t forget it, but I don’t feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to the medical university in Vladikacas.
I'm going to learn to become a cardiosurgery.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health was not allowed.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it's not gonna happen.
George Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived, despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
Unbelievable: George Farniew was at the feet of a killer terrorist during the capture, but he managed to survive.
During his capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer terrorist.
It is indeed a miracle that he was not killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says Georgie, who wanted to learn from an intelligence officer at the FSB, but was unable to do so because of the damage he suffered during his capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children are easily dealt with by bad events -- I must say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the first and last time I entered this gym.
I fainted.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show me where I was sitting on this famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgy Farniew today with a picture of himself in the hospital after taking it.
My pain is great, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with a knee that's been damaged, but now I'm doing all right.
But health still prevented me from going to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that this was impossible.
The second one I took was animals, so I went to a veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all the cat-to-cow animals.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
It's not what children should know, and it's not, of course, what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42 years old, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know Georgie won't go.
It has to be even stronger for him because he was there, and I'm not.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me, and here in Beslan the print is on everyone.
He stays with us.
Georgie's grown up now, but he's still a nightmare.
It's hard to accept when something is so terribly unfair, it's happening to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knees.
He's got several operations, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say that he'd overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it's impossible to completely overcome it and forget it.
That awful experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and it only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and loved.
My son's with me, and that's the best gift God could make me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm looking at what's happening in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
War is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe.
We were the only friend country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many have been killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them away, as far as you can.
Tskaeva Aline, 10 years old
Mandot, who was sneaked into a safe place by a S.D.
Saved: Alenu Tskaev is brought to a safe place by the Russian Special Forces (left).
She is now ten, and she is unaware of a terrible crime.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alenu was taken from a captured school in Beslan by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists let her go but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, her ten-year-old sister Christine and Brother Mahara in the school gymnasium.
The mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alenina’s mother and sister died in a deadly slaughter.
Her father, Ruslane, has married again since, and they have with his new wife, Svetlana, a little daughter whom he called Christiana in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alina, now ten years old, remembers nothing about the capture and the development of a smart and life - threatening girl by her neighbors.
"They're a great happy family now, and Alina and Mahar are both beautiful kids," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
Sinazi Kagawa's Lieutenant, who returned from Manchester United to Dormundia, said that he was looking forward to being able to get back into the field in the form of a German club.
He says that this transfer is a happy event in a career.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm going to play for the Conference again, bringing Bild's words to Kagawa.
I feel very good.
I have positive emotions, and I look forward to getting back into the field in the form of the "Brussian" form.
Remember, Kagawa moved to the MoU in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, it was never built into an English club, with only 38 matches in the English championship for two seasons, killing 6 balls and giving 8 results.
A man charged with visiting a girl at the Pythian pedestrian crossing to Faif
A 78-year-old man will be tried on charges of a three-year-old girl on a Pyfea pedestrian crossing.
Gordon Stuart was supposed to have hit a girl at the Pittenwin transition in East Newk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart had taken his Audi Q3 without due diligence and attention and had hit the girl, resulting in an injury.
Stuart, 78, from Ansterter, denied his guilt in Dundee's sheriff's court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, set the date for the trial in January.
Obama, Merkel and Allland will not return to Vladivostok
A duty-free shop at the Duty Free Airport of Vladivostok set up a tablet that would prohibit the buying of a number of world political leaders in that store.
And do not turn away from them with perfumes, with water, and a horse.
The store administration decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, Chancellor of FWG Angel Merkel, French President François Allland, Vitaly Cličko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan, and several other well-known comrades would not be able to untie the water, horses and perfumes in their store.
And I put a tablet on the door.
Obama has previously received a ban on even less accessible institution service, Dietary Courts, as reported by the general hospital's website.
Whether the American president of the dream ever eats at a diet table in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the ban seem to be terribly acute.
Is there cheese after the embargo? Medvedev gave advice to the agriculturals.
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, believes that under the embargo, Russian agrarians should develop new technologies in order to launch the commodity varieties claimed from buyers.
The Board was provided during a visit to Agrocompex by the South Enterprise.
The Head of Government also gave a board of reporters to adjust to Russian meat, the quality of which is at an appropriate level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since 7 August.
The leading Russian trainer, Valentine Maslacov, is pleased with the outcome of the December tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place was a good result, given the lack of targeted preparation for the competitions.
Our athletes spoke at their own level, bringing Maslacova's English words to "Among sports".
The third place is the confirmation of our fairly high command level.
It's a pleasure to have the French and even Americans on top of us.
We should be aware that we were not preparing for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not begun to oblige our leaders to participate in the DecaNation.
In recent years, we have become the second party to this tournament, but during this season we have updated our collection.
On the contrary, the French have set up a capable team of 13 champions of Europe.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, as they have been publicly announced on many occasions.
Even so, the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians have spoken to such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were much lower than that in the same Brillant League.
The season is over.
Of course, athletes are no longer as important as the results, especially in command-level competitions.
The main place was here.
And the result, I agree, is that it's absurd that by 1,500 metres, men were so involved in tactical maneuvers of running, which they showed is the result of lower... women's escapes.
4 clues to how to improve underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a picture or take a video under the water, you're looking at a number of options.
The cheapest option is a watertight soap mill, for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an ecceler, for example, GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edit, both of which are sold for about $300.
I made these pictures at a family party with a couple of cameras, all at a cost of about $350.
Regardless of the equipment you use, several rules must be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Recheck your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproofing chamber, make sure that your camera batteries and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the kind of photos or videos you're going to take.
Some photo and video cameras have monitor or object type regimes that optimize exposures for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, see how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cells are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's leadership and digital camera ratings for both conventional and watertight models.
Take a few jobs, because a lot of them won't get.
There's a JCK in "mills" that can help you build pictures, whereas there's usually no Exch camera.
Even if you have a JCK, it'll be hard to look under the water, and it's going to be a random process.
So share some of your skills.
Also, if your cell has a serial survey mode that takes a few personnel off with a little different exposure, use it.
Stay in the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly as you dive beneath the water.
If possible, stay on the surface when you're filming in the pool, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to pass on more colors in your photographs; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Come closer to the filming facilities.
It's a great advice for land survey, but it's even more important under water because of dark light conditions.
Especially important if you are filming an Exch camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, broad-based lens, which means that you will have to get closer to the sites if you want to fill in the staff.
The 2012 Bronze Prize of the Olympic Games on the Bilal Mahh free struggle could move into the Greco-Rim struggle.
This was reported by the Chief Coach of Dagestan's Lobby in Sajid Sajidov's free struggle.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of an athlete in the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
At present, Biljal Mahh is at the gathering of a group of “classics”, cites Sajid Sajidov’s words “R-Sport”.
In fact, there was a billa speaking in both styles.
At the world’s youth level in 2005, he was the winner of the Volks and the third prize in the Greek - Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on a free struggle.
It has long been said that a new phase of our career will be hard on us in the Greek-Rima struggle.
I'll tell you more: Mach can be on the world championship in Tashkent, if he wins.
But the key word is always behind the coach headquarters, headed by Gogi Koguashville.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose strength of the individual could get all around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
Counseling anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to the removal of patients from both the suffering of disease and the suffering of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalled that there was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson realized that while the doctor was diagnosed with diagnosis and disease, those who were being treated were mostly concerned about something different -- pain.
One day in 2007, however, he turned out to be someone who had started to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
I had a hard time finding strength.
In his fight with flulike symptoms, he discovered that he was angry with his wife, Juliet.
"I want everything to happen faster than later," he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found out that he was unusual and confused about why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked his colleague to X-ray the chest.
Just two weeks earlier, he had been riding skiings in the French Alps.
X-ray results came.
It was a mesolytomy, an incurable cancer that affected a plevor, or lung shell.
For most cancers, it is difficult to figure out the exact cause.
Although some smokers have had lung cancer, for example, not all those with lung cancer have.
But it's different with a meslician.
In almost all cases, the reason is to contact asbestos, the fibrous building material that was once called "miracle," but which is now known to be deadlyly dangerous.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbest is, after all, material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the United Kingdom since the 1960s, when a general industrial ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipelines, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another age is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But such calmness is wrong.
Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic.
There are more people dying of mesculomas here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual mortality rate of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than from road accidents.
Annual deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly effects now is that while asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were ultimately prohibited by law in 1999), it usually takes decades for mesothelitists to develop.
And the attack on the mesopels is not limited to industrial veterinaries.
Asbest was, and in many cases it's still, placed in the house where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops we go shopping.
As a result, the mesoptomy does not pay attention to class, wealth, profession or age.
The elective drums, from fashionable London unveiled schools to private schools, have turned out to be no salvation.
The Parliament building is covered by asbestos.
Even the hospitals, which are designed to treat us, have become the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a pipe conductor.
In fact, he had to think about where he could get in touch with asbestos.
Then he made it.
"I think there might have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnel at Guya Hospital, where I spent six years on internship," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors, and truckers used these tonnages.
I wonder how many of my peers will have the same disease?
That was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who were interned in Gaja hospital and who subsequently had a mesopite in the last five years,” he noted in a letter in 2010, “I am the only one alive”.
How many of us are affected by this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed when he was 48 years old.
When he died, on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It's not unusual to live that long.
Fifty percent of those with mesothelioma die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us have this same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pito, a leading expert in the United Kingdom, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most of them don't know what they're going to die like this now.

A rapid review of court records, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesopian attack has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Sponzer admitted that he had been mistreated by Jeans Ellen in contact with asbestos.
She worked on the net for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, run by the clothing department at two sites, one of which was the main store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She's now got two kids over 20 years of age.
"Before that happened," she said, "I never heard of a mesopite, I hardly knew about asbestos.
I couldn't have thought it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance, it is a group of six minerals.
They have been named for the word “asbestiform”, which means a fibrous structure that informs them of strength and flexibility.
Of those six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is far more frequent in buildings to date today.
It was used in blood panels, on - lined tiles, pipe thermal insulation, boilers, even car brakes.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as “a major source of health damage”, which can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amsidite) and blue asbestos (crodolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts assume that “there are strong, though indirect grounds for believing that this is the main cause of an extremely high number of mesothelioma patients [in Britain]”.
Marks' staff member & Sponzer was exposed to asbestos at the company's head store at Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janice Ellen may not have thought of himself as a typical Mesoptolic victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He carried out a study of patients, which suggests that “the true percentage of mesothelics, when there is no known impact on work or home, are likely to be caused by asbestos exposure from the environment”.
Most of this, he says, is due to the “normal use and weather effects” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting Report, which considered the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the very centre of government, could be exposed to unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind the premises of the parliamentary committees were contaminated by asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be driven into something as harmless as “strong airflows”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in such a case it seems right to the contrary.
Although the Parliament ' s Technical Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “pure sanitary certificate”, it now recognized that work was required to rebuild Parliament, to improve electricity and to remove asbestos, and that, after the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might meet at the QE2 conference centre in the vicinity of the Parliament rather than on the green benches of Westminster.
The Goddard Report noted that “the situation with asbestos was not regulated according to the various rules”.
It is impossible to know if this management error is worth living.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who has not yet been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor of general practice.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbot, age 50, he is suspected of being exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I've been working in a hospital that's been successfully brought up with asbestos-related claims," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's hard to remember all the places you worked and the dates.
What he remembers is that it's a day early in December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45 and he was in the middle of the operation late in the evening.
Suddenly, I started to get upset.
It started very fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbot knew that his pain was coming from a pleur around the lungs.
But, like Jeance Ellen, he just didn't have a reason to suspect a mesoite.
In the end, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Intelligent doctors took x-rays of the chest and put pleuric cartridges to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it for tests.
Yet, his condition was not diagnosed.
His state of health gradually improved, and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, the same symptoms returned, often after he was in sports and with a heavy breath.
In 2011, one of Abbot's patients came to him with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with a “metholite” diagnosis.
Even then, however, Abbot failed to link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was ten years older and was working directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was evident.
In September 2011, Abbot’s condition deteriorated again and his consulting doctor showed him the results of the KT and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, two years after Abbot began to feel bad, a camera-equipped sensor was injected into a strip between his chest shell and his light shell.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
I didn't worry too much about it, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I'm told it's a mesoptomy."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbot was caught up in a meeting with Macmillian nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That was when he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
"It turns out asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was often asbestos thermal insulation on the pipes," he said.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from the disease.
Thus, the mesotomy now impresses younger people with non-traditional professions.
The most dangerous assbet - isolated pipes in the hospitals were in the basement, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many of the staff who were walking through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or who ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
For several decades after the war, it turns out the hospitals were a place where theoretically life was saved for the consumers, but a place that posed a threat to life for the physicians who treated them.
He's still getting removed today.
The students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos support.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and mayors because of its amazing isolation and fireproofness.
The schools, too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed for the first time to asbestos in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in countless classes of chemistry, school children put their own Bunsen burners on asbestos symphony.
Websites have come up to highlight asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things, such as a slab or a roof roof, were usually made up of asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison, laid down in a great deal of our buildings," observes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden barn in the 1970s.
So be careful about sleeping with garden sheds.
The diagnosis effect is known to be incurable, grooman.
"It takes quite a while to realize it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to go and figure it out.
Well, I'm not meeting Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor to a patient’s position.
As an incalculable number before him, he remembers how confused was the amount of information he had to accept.
"It was hard to understand," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not meeting Christmas anymore.
That's all."
Mesoulite is particularly dangerous because it's the mechanics of how we support life -- the act of breathing -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most of the cases are due to contact with asbestos.
Asbest consists of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos breaks and the fibers are inhaled, it can be stuck into the shoulder, the lungs of the lungs.
Asbest fibers are irritable to the plevor and may cause the mutation of the cells.
"The disease occurs because of the inhalation of the illed fibers of asbestos," by Professor Tom Treger, a cardiocratic surgeon who came to Guy's hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where Andrew Lawson was suspected of being exposed to asbestos, now, by irony, the lead centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Trenger knew Lawson and treated some of the others who were likely exposed while in the hospital.
When the asbestos needles fall into the tissue of the lungs, says Treger, "the breath pushes them to the field where the shell lies.
This is essentially an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatments for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelitomy.
The effectiveness of surgical interventions, for example, is causing heated disputes.
Some think it's worth a try.
Trenger disagrees.
"It's impossible to cut the plevor," he says.
There's no way around her to come up with a knife.
However, this cancer "is not very good at chemotherapy" that "actions" but does not cure.
"Time from time to time, there are sick people who live a long time," says Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live far, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbyt continues to fight.
After he got sick with mesothelioma, Abbyt was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, had become the support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Allo, Rakova Central," he said excitedly when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbyt.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
Abbott first proposed six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "suffered to give it a little bit more positive."
Having met with several specialists, Abbett decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loik Lang-Laszunski, Professor of Toracical Medicine at the Guya Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need the direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," Graham admitted.
The average statistical patient would have had to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma to get the best of available treatments.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients face yet another financial cause for concern — the families they leave behind.
They then apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from the Field Fish Waterhouse LLP.
"It was known asbestos is harmful to health, since 1898," Morgan said.
But what's changed in the 1960s is that it's clear that even very small quantities could be exposed to health risks.
That's when we talked about company integrity.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a full-cost settlement, according to Morgana, because Lawson was not able to prove clearly that his mesolytomy was the result of contact with Asibate at Guya Hospital.
Following an investigation into his death, the representative of Gaja hospital confirmed, however, that “the asbestos in the basements referred to was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbesto
In fact, tying death-related contact with asbestos to one company or workplace, usually decades later, has proved to be a major problem for patients with mesotheliomas requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers changed or closed.
Insurance archives could be lost.
And those who defend themselves against a lawsuit know that there is no time on their side that the plaintiffs don't have.
In response this year, serious new legislation has been introduced that facilitates the recovery of compensation to patients with mesolic disease even if their former employers cannot be tracked.
Under this Act, a  Your Insurance Fund was established at 350 Million for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who has no legal case.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case, about ?120000.
About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, as many people working with mesothelioma patients, believes that ‐350 million is “very good work” for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, saying, the amount is one quarter of what the insurers would have to pay had it not been for the intervention of the temporary period and those with mesothelioma would have been able to track the company and file a claim on a regular basis.
Even Mike Penning, formerly the Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “unimplemented”.
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that while seven people die every day, rapid action was necessary.
"People are suffering so much and they need help today," said Penning at the second reading of Bill of Mesothemi last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loca Lange-Laszunski for 19 months.
Following the initial consultations of Lange Laszunski, he recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lange Laszunski could boast as much as 40 per cent of those who survived in five years.
Abbott felt a sense of strength.
"This, of course, is one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see that from patients all the time.
There's some power behind you.
When you give up, things get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbyt got into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had finished the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
Follow-up scans didn't show any sign of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were several hundred [rocks] in my chest.
I was just supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbyt went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things -- financials -- when I die, for example, or what I need to show my wife how a timer works on a fighter.
When you get the bad news, you become bleak.
We need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, age 16, and Tamzin, age 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how to say a lot.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to get old.
They reacted in very different ways.
The pace is very general and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many of us were calling very quickly.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancers have to face.
But for those with mesolithea, such discussions are not balanced with hope, even a stupendous opportunity to survive.
The disease carries a grim definition for Stephen Jay Guld (as well as for Stephen J. H. G.G.) in the long run.
According to Andrew Morgan, "the mesoptomy doesn't pose a threat to life.

Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health injury resulting from contact with asbestos in Britain.
World production of asbestos has grown to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Security in Britain requires that all contractors working with asbestos be licensed.
Imports and the use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in Britain.
All the use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesthelic Act was passed in the United Kingdom.
The compensation scheme amounts to  Yourselves350 million.

World production is held at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; the objecters of retaliation
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
Such a course is likely to trigger long-awaited protests in Hong Kong ' s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing at the estimated hours after the announcement.
The decision of the National People ' s Congress of China, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It has not deceived our expectations, but it does lead to rage," said legislator Emily Love, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They have deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
The protective decision of China, Lee Faye, Under-Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, said that allowing the popular nomination for the election of the head of Hong Kong would be too “haotic”.
Since the British handed over control of Hong Kong back to China in 1997, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants of the region to choose a chapter of government by vote, beginning in 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision made on Sunday as a democratic step forward because it gave the Hong Kongs the right to a direct vote; however, the decision also made it clear that Chinese leaders would continue to hold the process in their hands through a commission of candidates strictly controlled from Beijing.
And, under the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was taken after the summer, when some of the largest protests took place in Hong Kong over the years.
Over the bulk of the democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central with Love and Peace, which was threatened to close Hong Kong's financial district if Beijing does not guarantee this universal electoral right.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of Occupy Central met under rain in front of the Hong Kong Government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was moving towards a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise in protest in the following weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “thinked that the central area could be seized only as an exceptional measure, an action that could be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue had been exhausted and no other choice had been made.
It is with great regret that to date, all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central area will no doubt take place.
Public authorities in Hong Kong were preparing for Beijing's application for a few days, and security measures with police and barricade were strengthened on Sunday at Government headquarters.
It is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
Competition in goods and services has increased from mainland to mainland.
There is also the fear that Hong Kong ' s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put the business force of Hong Kong at risk.
"The test they say may cause economic harm depending on how long and how long a person will be involved," said legislator Regina Yip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is an idea that is harmful to investment.
The Chinese public media have also reported in the last days where the Hong Kong democratic activists have been shown to be diversificationists directed by the Western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted over 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of the Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands came to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American graduation culture comes to university: the first class was offered to arrive on a personal plane.
We are happy to respond to this demand by launching the first Lux travel service in the United Kingdom for current students.
In order to leave a vivid impression of coming to university, the company also offers options such as a private plane, a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin, or a McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also said the service thought about security.
The service is the ideal alternative for students who usually have to take their stuff across the country in a dangerous overloaded car.
Together with our new version of the VIF, we look forward to helping students this year get to university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
The company representative reported that since the service had just been started, no orders had yet been received, but added that “studies will start ordering the service in the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that, despite the fact that the students had a need to pay their fees for the training, it hoped to find a market for that service.
Current students are quite different from students 10 years, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make a remarkable first impression, and VIF is exactly what needs to be done.
Nevertheless, the student National Union criticized the service as being devoid of reality.
Megan Dunn, the Vice-President of NPO for Higher Education, said: " This project seems incredibly life-dealed to most students.
Many students who start university studies this month face a cost-of-living crisis where affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the rapidly increasing costs of basic needs, before they can even begin thinking of getting thousands of pounds out on something like a simple arrival in a dorm.
Feminists raise the question of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
A unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who came raise their hands by saying, "Do not shoot," while they're waiting in line for funerals.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, involving the murder of an unarmed youth, Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez saw a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, the white feminists, who left the comments, had placed the gender above the racial background when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tension grew in the Middle West and attracted national attention, Pérez saw the responses of white women, which concentrated 100 per cent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the 9 August murder, the personal essays with titles such as "Ferguson's thought of white woman" and "Feminism is not just about women's oppression" were relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis that we're facing, and because (the Ferguson situation) is so racist, they felt they needed to point it out.
For an English professor at the University of Ohio Corita Mitchell Ferguson, he found the problems that black Americans face every day but who are not perceived as “women's issues” in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'll get 150 sweares around," Mitchell says.
When I write something about how colourful people are being attacked in their own country, silence deafs.
"Why are women safe to talk about relationships, but not public safety?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share those problems; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in the Feminist major, Angela Hetteri, professor of women's and gender studies at the University of George Mason, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"In 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were scrambling, and the basis for this was almost always the rape of a white woman," he said.
There was a white woman who was required to confirm the story in order to justify the ligament.
From the Hutter ' s point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suicideists, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for electoral law would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in the basket of the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later," Heteri told.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear idea of why women of color do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against the lynchings of the South Women ' s Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
This group came almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
In Mitchell's view, the resurgence of the white feminists to the issues raised by Ferguson's situation - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to “solve” the problems that black women had dealt with in several generations.
"It would be great if activists who have such a [traditional feministic] ideology were to take the right to raise a child seriously, how do they relate to the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The Feminists of the second wave, who have given their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Stainem, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, took advantage of Facebook and published an obsessive article by Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take more part in protests about racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger of a body -- and a view of racial issues that are significantly different in public surveys -- will be at the head of change," wrote Statin.
Although Stynaem is responsible for more intersecting feminism, which includes racial issues, and gender, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
A researcher at the American Institute of Business, Christine Sommers, who stole the feminism, said that young men in the United States, especially the colorful young people, are "more vulnerable than their sisters", but Styman's marbles about Ferguson contradicted the criticism she had expressed earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, “The Guard of My Brother,” to help vulnerable black and Spanish - speaking youths, an angry reaction was followed by many feminists, including Gloria Stainem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem leading to the front line of traditional feminism.
Following the arrest by the U.S. Border Service of some 63,000 minors without escort to the south-west border of the country this year, immigration reform has again come to the surface -- this is the problem of women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilized women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to address this issue as important to women, she had only to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of working visas are issued to [men migrant], women who come with them are placed in a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find responses from women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich pig house sold
Photographs of a home set up for sale in Saffolka were removed by real estate agents when it appeared to have a large pig resting in a living room.
A separate house with one bedroom stands on the private road in Ipswich.
A detailed description was taken by a picture of the living room on which a pig with its head on the couch was painted.
Connels Real Estate Agency reported that a pig in a photo is a homeowner's pet.
"One, the photograph was placed by mistake and removed," said a company representative.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described a former assembly house as “a unique separate house with one bedroom”.
Although the agency removed the photo from its website, it was still in advertising.
The sale of the house has aroused interest in social networks, where some have asked whether pigs are sold together with home.
Russian tennisist Maria Charapova, in fourth circle of US Open, Caroline Woznikov, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish her year with dignity and to try to get to a new level, and she passes Vasily SDIER from New York.
How do you measure your results in the "Big helmet" tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won the Rollan Garros.
As for the other three Turks, I had little stability, especially some matches.
I'm upset right now.
I couldn't even reach the fourth.
What challenges do you face before the end of the season?
After the injury, I have a huge motivation to get to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year with dignity.
A Asian series of tours begins in a couple of weeks.
Member of the Committee of the State of Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, Nicholas Valuev, a former World Cup, proposed that the MTO should be granted bonuss upon admission to higher education.
He said that, in general, the standards would be the same as in Soviet times, and people would be giving standards of stretching, running and other exercises.
Remember, the 12 constituent entities of Russia are beginning to implement TTOs since 1 September on their territory.
I also invited schoolgirls who gave up the UTO to give bonuss when they went to the university, and I said, "Walve."
For example, you might want to add some points to the EGE.
There are also proposals for additional terminations for businesses that have undergone these sporting tests.
In the city of Harvey in South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning the lottery.
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
There is a search for a new millionaire south-west of Perth, where one lucky man takes home almost $1.1 million of the game of the lottery on Saturday night.
The Harvey news stand brings gold at the top of the second prize in five years, the last win being $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still has to declare himself.
The owner of the Ste Forward bench said that the winner had caused a fortune in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole town is talking about it, and it's all very excited.
We thought such a winning might be a secret.
Eight Western Australian winners celebrated the prize-winning game last month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a Kinging Way player became one of the five millionaires in August, after a huge $7.5 million winning couple from Belmont just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple have been playing for 20 years and have told them that winning has given them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
A Harvey millionaire brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total gain of $85 million.
Mini-economic development wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
This week, the Ministry of the Interior will introduce a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia to the Government and briefed the deputy of the Department of Oleg Plucniks at the round table hosted by the "Vedament" on Moscow Autosalon 2014.
The plan has been drawn up on behalf of the Government and one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted by the end of September and early October, according to the Powderians, the measures proposed relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - the road development plan for gas-fuels in Russia is already in place.
The plan (copy is available in the "Venetics") is 2014-2017.
It is necessary to develop criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport and to decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the Government describing the tax and customs support measures for electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a concessional credit scheme and soft lease will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce car prices, encourage localization and establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is intended to amend the regulations to facilitate the construction of the charged infrastructure (in parking, auto-fuelling and other areas).
In addition, federal officials intend to make proposals to the regional authorities during 2015 to encourage the use of environmentally sound transport, in the form of an advantage in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016, to increase the procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will put into the list of regional authorities ' assessments the criteria for the efficiency of support for cleaner transport production and the development of the charged infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is still being formed - about 100 electric vehicles are being sold throughout the country in 2013.
At the beginning of 2014, import duties for electric vehicles were leveled and sales were about 500, predicting the principal executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.
But five times the growth does not make the electric vehicles visible: in 2013, according to the Association of European Business, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold.
Only Mitsubishi Motors is importing electric vehicles to Russia.
Starting with the import process, Renault, the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Russia, Nicolas Remis.
Most of the other electrical manufacturers, however, took a waiting position with regard to Russia.
The development of electric vehicles has also been done by Russian producers, "," GAZ, "" but the output is mineral.
For example, in January and July 2014, according to the data from the ASM Halling, AvotoWAZ released 30 electric vehicles.
Demands are low owing to the cost of electric vehicles, acknowledges the director of AvotoWAZ for engineering of Sergey Amanov, without the power of a breakthrough in this segment...
The development of the Russian car market, in addition to the road traffic, (the electric vehicles sold in Russia, the more expensive analogies with internal combustion engines on average) deters the failure of the charged infrastructure (coupling - units), sighs with the `Avtostat'gene Zedkov.
The expensive and low lower cost of electric vehicles will leave the field segment of the Russian market in the next three to four years, predicting the main editor, Michael Podroganski, and the Pedestrians agree with him.
On the other hand, car manufacturers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of normal cars.
In the Russian electricity market, good prospects are to build confidence in consumers that “electronicity” is real; in particular, it will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, stresses the President of Group BMW in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented by, for example, the “Rossetti” Hospital, several stations built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon be available.
Negotiations on the construction of a flood network are under way with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofiin, director of Rosejee, the company believes in the electricity market and is ready to build gas stations across the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and a lack of a single standard to charge different branded electric vehicles.
In addition, as a network company, Rossetti is not entitled to sell electricity, an opportunity is being developed to do so with regard to the charge of electric vehicles.
The Pankov believes that the most effective measure to support the formation in Russia of an electric power market is the duplicating of customs duties.
The zero rate will continue until the end of 2014, the opportunity to extend it, and the grace list will be expanded.
The replacement of transport tax on environmental (the idea being discussed and applicable to all cars) would also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, in the Punkov ' s view.
The transport tax in Russia is low, says Pankov, as opposed to Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sale of electric vehicles, now accounting for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, incentives are needed for car owners, such as free parking in the center of the city (as had already been done in Moscow), confident Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles along designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
Private aircraft crashed in Colorado
Piper's one-wing plane, PA-46, crashed in Colorado, U.S.A.
Three out of five people in it were killed, transmitted to ITAR-TASS.
Survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident took place several kilometres from the airstrip of Denver Airport.
The causes of the tragedy are being determined.
In Donetsk region, prisoners of the Dunbass battalion are dealt with.
The Karaites were surrounded by Ilowiska.
They were loyal to their own commanders, and dozens of gunmen were killed under fire.
Survivors say that if they knew what the situation in south-eastern Ukraine really was, they would not go to war.
The 108 prisoners are lucky.
The "Donbass" cartons survived after the "milslops" they fell under Ilowayski.
In the framework of the Donetsk People ' s Republic army, the fighters spent several days, virtually abandoned by their commanders and Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from headquarters that the ring could be taken out of the said corridor, the column was moving.
But in just a few minutes, projectiles and bullets are dropped off from all sides.
"For the information I've been given, we've had a corridor, we've been allowed out," says the deputy battalion commander with the name "Lermont."
And when we got down between the Multipol and the Redsel, a cross-fire started with anti-tank controlled missiles, snouts, 30-mm grenades, automatic BMM guns, small arms.
There were four cars ahead of me, and then there were only two cars left behind.
The summons officer, Laermontov, relates that almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were wounded, and many had died later.
Survivors are now providing medical assistance to those they have come to kill.
Now prisoners are surprised that the so-called terrorists treat them well, give food and medicine.
While their own commanders had actually deceived them and condemned them to die again.
We were betrayed, they say.
Colon, the whole battalion, to be destroyed.
Like many of his comrades, today's Dunbass battalion, Alexey was volunteered, and the Ukrainian news told about the atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east by the separatists.
Alexey saw a very different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there's a mortar shooting, which is probably the Ukrainian armed forces, is telling one of the soldiers Alexey.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We were not released from Ilowisca, they said we were in a ring.
I already made an appointment with the commander, and the report has already been written about the withdrawal.
We were taken to Ilowisk on charges with Zurahvo.
According to the prisoners, between 300 and 350 people were stuck in "cotle".
Some survivors now admit that if time could be turned back, they would not have entered the guard battalion for anything.
All the prisoners were handed over to the Forces of the DNR.
Everyone is screened for involvement in war crimes.
A headquarters has been set up in the region to limit the price of products
Krasnoyar Krasnoyar has established a headquarters that will limit the growth in the region ' s product prices, if necessary.
A decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters was composed of members of the Government of the Province, representatives of the executive branch and oversight agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural production in the country.
To make the economy ? Would Kiev "Rosepht" cost $140 million?
Igor Sechin, the head of the "Rosephti", stated that the company estimated the damage to the Liscian NNP shelling in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported this to an interview by Spiegel.
“We assess the damage of $140 million and we will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government for compensation”, said Sechin.
He said that a modernized company, Liscian NPP, was planned to operate in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no combat, there were no 'unsinsurgents'," but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
"In addition, there was no technological oil in the pipes," he said.
You will recall that on 18 July, in response to the firing of the Liscian NPP, a oil storage tank was burned and two storage facilities were destroyed.
Liscian NPP, the main refinery plant in Ukraine, was first introduced in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Liscian NPP is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is able to produce Euro-4 fuel as well as the "Euro 5" batch.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Liscian NPP were suspended due to its loss.
It was decided that the repair would begin at the plant.
A year later, Rosnepht received the Liscian NNP along with other Ukrainian TNC-XB assets.
The DPRK launched a small-range project towards the Japan Sea.
According to the South Korean media, this occurred about 10:30 a.m. local time on the side of Chaganda, a province bordering North Korea and China.
According to Interfax, the South Korean Chiefs' Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff reportedly fell into the Japan Sea after the rocket had flown some 220 kilometres.
Rubl falls against the background of geopolitical pressure
In the Moscow Exchange, the dollar grew by 3 copies to 37.15 roubles, the rouble fell to the billboard in the face of geopolitical tension.
The dollar bids started transactions at borders 37.11-37.2 rou/$1, an average of 37.16 rou/$1, which is 4 copies above the previous closure in two minutes.

The United States dollar trades 23 copies above the official rate, and the euro 16 copies above the official rate.
The Russian market continued to fall rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but panic did not occur this time.
He's gone cheap and the ruble, and he's even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are now playing a long-term role in deteriorating geopolitical conditions and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But so far, it's more like artificial hysteria being spread through the media, especially the Western.
The options for introducing new sanctions to the FMF are not so many.
TeleTrade, " At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to be sharply weakened against the billing basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, unless we soon see a new negative and Russian indices and the position of the national currency can be adjusted.
The Landing Airlines will be tried with the Ideal Tour.
The L 'Handburg Airlines have brought claims totalling 4.7 billion roubles.
Two cases will be heard in October.
The cases will be handled by different judges.
According to Interfax, the first case was filed on 14 August.
Its sum is just over 425 million rubles.
Its meeting was scheduled for 7 October.
A second application was filed on 18 August.
Its sum is 4.24 billion rubles.
A meeting has been scheduled for 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Union for Industrial Touries, different judges have been appointed.
In July, the media reported a debt of 1.5 billion roubles to the Orenburg Avengers.
The airline director, Victor Zükin, refers to the sum of 1.6 billion rubles.
Vitaly Savelev, the director of the "Aerfolota", calls an even greater sum of two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to be more interesting to new users
Twitter services changed the user registration process to involve new participants in active engagement with the platform as soon as possible.
This measure should reduce the number of people abandoned by their micrologies.
The new Twitter users will now be viewed during registration with a large number of recommended accounts, in order to produce their readings as soon as possible.
Recommendations are formulated on the basis of the interests mentioned in the registration.
Twitter automatically sets the subscriber check for all automatically selected accounts.
That's why the user's gonna have to hand- taken a check so he won't read those who don't.
If only recommended users have seen microblog users before, Twitter now prints a sample of a popular blogger's Twitter to help make an impression of the person.
This is the biggest change in the Twitter registration country over the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been active in the modernization of the service.
This activity is primarily linked to the ongoing attempts by the service to achieve impunity.
In 2014, the microblogged service experienced a slow growth in the user base and a decline in reader activity.
The company now desperately needs more loyal consumers who would have stayed behind for a long time.
Only by this means can the advertising flow be sustained.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be lush and rainy.
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy all day, reporting meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow will be between 16 and 18 degrees, in Submoscowice 13 to 18 degrees.
When clouds are clear, the weather will be covered by rain, and the wind in the eastern quarter will be quite weak - just 3 to 8 meters per second.
Vehicle management programme resumed with effect from 1 September
Since 1 September, the car disposal programme has been reactivated in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As Director Denise Mantourov of the Ministry of Industry and Trade explained, money is being allocated from the floor, which has already been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade by redeployment from other support areas.
The program concerns all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation would range from 40,000 per car to 350,000 roubles per truck.
A similar car disposal programme had already been in place in Russia.
The main difference between the current project, the Minister explained, is that it is now not only anticipated that machines will be disposed of for a later discount, but also the possibility, if the car reaches the age of more than six years of age, to purchase a new one with a discount when the old man is handing over to the dealer, is passed on to Interfax.
More than 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal recycling programme, which took place from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2011.
As a result, the level of car production in 2010 was about 1.2 million (this is plus 101.4 per cent by 2009).
The Creator, Coming Out Simulator, will release the game of modern journalism
The Geimsizer, Nikki Case, known for the game of Cometing Out Simulator, decided to release the game of modern journalism.
He told me about his project in an interview with KillScreen.
Case had begun to work on the game a few weeks ago, but it was not until now that this was widely known.
The inspiration for the game was in Ferguson, where the protests started after a police officer killed a unarmed black youth.
In the focus of a project that has not yet been named, it will be how information coverage of stories affects its impact.
The game hero, a civilian journalist, will have to photograph what's happening in areas where there's fighting between the police and the population.
The hero might take a different picture of what happened, which would have an impact on the course of events.
If he films the scene so that the police will look like heroes and the protestors are bandits, the police will be better able to treat him and let him go wherever the ordinary person can go.
If he covers events differently, his photographs may turn peaceful protests into a large-scale rebellion.
The points in the game will have to be picked up by a Twitter character, where new subscribers will appear if the photos taken there are popular.
The game has not been named yet.
The date of the release and the platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image demonstrating how the event could change depending on how the picture of it was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill screen Cases explained that he had thought about the concept of such a game a long time ago, but originally wanted to devote it to events in the Gaza Strip rather than to protests in the United States.
After he started collecting material for the game, he realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to tell the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media reporting events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game on account of what had happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who makes browser games.
The most famous of his projects was the Cometing Out of Simulator, which took place in 2014.
This game, which tells about events in Case’s own biography, is about how bisexual teenagers are trying to tell their relationship to homophobic parents.
Heletway pulls Ukraine into the continuation of bloodshed.
The call to prepare for another “ten thousand” victims, the Ukrainian Minister of Defence, Valery Géletei, drags the people into an ongoing bloody confrontation, is referred to in the report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valérie Géletei, who stated that the “exceeding of an operation to release the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great National War” would be calculated as“ tens of thousands”.
The extent to which the head of the Ukrainian military, who had published the post on his page in Faisbuk, was adequate, is not in the military field,” states the communication of Russian diplomats.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “The Russian side has threatened several times on informal channels that if the resistance continues, they are prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
However, he stated that the “operation on the release of the east of Ukraine” had been completed.
Reez Hilton removed all the intimate star images and apologized.
Today more than 60 Hollywood stars are terrified.
Hackers hacked primitive passwords into iCloud in smartphones, and their intimate images appeared on blogger Perez Hilton's website.
Really, not for long.
Remember, Jennifer Lawrence, an official of the Cold Games star, has already reported the theft of photographs from her cell phone, and has confirmed that all images that "sow" in the Network are genuine.
Reez Hilton, the creator of the same-named tabloid site, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues at the store for publishing their frank images, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
Their agents didn't contact me.
And now I'm taking off Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice, blogger in Twitter.
However, all the open photographs of the stars have already flown on the Web.
David Beckham got involved in an accident hiding from Paparazzi
David Beckham was in a motorcycle accident, sleeping with Paparazzi.
It was in Los Angeles on a return trip to Bulvara Sanset.
A British football player got caught up with a muscle shot and a sprain of his right hand.
Beckham got out of his dad's salon, where he was waited for by Paparazzi.
Flexible from their attack on the motorcycle, he did not make a turn with control and fell, writes TMZ with reference to sources close to a football player.
As a result, Beckham was beaten, the muscle was stretched to the right hand, and the scratches to the king.
Tony Stuart endures an accident by returning to the track
Tony Stuart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of a race at Atlanta Motor Spedway.
Stuart cut into the wall for a second time after his right foreleg broke into 172 circles, ending his performance.
Stuart took his trip car to the garage and then walked out without talking to reporters.
The leader of his team, Chad Johnston, said that the 14 members of the team were upset but would now concentrate on the race for the next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better attempt and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and I hope we can do better there.
Stuart first crashed into the wall earlier Sunday night after the clash with Kyle Bush, which required the repair of the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty good hope of coming to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "It just wasn't done."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart’s car was loaded with a truck, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Spring Cup races after his car was hit and killed by another driver during a race on the ground route in the north of New York.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either at Atlanta or at the next Richmond race to participate in the prosecution.
He returned to work during the investigation into the tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Mild, who had been on the track to complain to Stuart during the race.
On Friday, the law enforcement authorities reported that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
No decision was taken as to whether Stuart would be charged.
The third champion was received with loud shouts and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starving from position 12, Stuart walked at the beginning of the race, reaching position 4.
Then 122 circles after the Bush restaurant.
The 18th was pulled off the track at turn 2 and hit Stuart, pushed both cars into the wall.
Stuart went on, but got back to position 21.
Beaver and Whitorgan have cigarettes with Zvancki in Odessa
Xenia Sobchak and Maxim Witgorg are now in Odessa, something the televiser has not neglected to report in his Instagram.
True, one of the photographs was very surprised and upset by the couple.
It's taken off at Zvanitzka.
"At breakfast, Mikhail Mikhalić Zvancki Maxim explained what an instagram: ) #Odessa" signed a picture of Xenia Sobchac.
However, there is nothing on the table other than cigarettes.
No coffee, no bunnies, oil and...
They decided that Kyusha was a smoker, and they condemned her for it.
"Whose cigarettes? "Curping kills!" "Smoking is a cigarette breakfast," "to see breakfast, and on the table only cigarettes"), "Casnia, do you smoke too?"
Recall that recently Sobczak boasted of the delicious first time in her life prepared by Maxim Whitorgan.
"It's happiness that when you come to lunch, and your husband has prepared dinner for you, for the first time for married life, which is delicious, and the most important thing is that at the end of the dinner he doesn't say in the words of an anecdota, 'that it may be this every day now,' boasted his husband, Xenia Sobachak.
The picture shows that Maxim is working hard on something and that there's a salty and baked chicken on the table.
Bulgarian prison officers conducted a national protest campaign
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria conducted a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to return to the former working conditions that had recently been changed.
Wage upgrading is also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Acting Minister of Justice, Christ Ivanov.
During the month, the officers symbolically protested the new work schedule, calling for the return of the previous 24-hour shift.
Although the Prison Service Union has met several times with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement has been reached, reports the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, and the head of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of Sentences, Rosen Zelvian, informed the BNP.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior will join in the protest of a union of prison officials.
The Army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Praut (right) appointed Pragswana Vangswan (left) as Minister of Defence
The military ruler and the Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayut Chan-Och, announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers of the country, in which more than a third of the posts are occupied by retired generals or generals.
Army representatives received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Och was formally approved as Prime Minister, following the formal approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the Head of the Transitional Military Government to the post.
The 60-year-old military man who took over power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup of 22 May was the only candidate for the office of the Prime Minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed parliamentarians.
According to Prautua Chan-Och, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six months of demonstration, during which protestors demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Jingla Chinawatt.
Chan-Ocha is officially the temporary prime minister, as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are fears that the military are trying to strengthen their authority in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May.
Against the backdrop of a complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the major political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the leading politicians of the country, including Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis was rooted in 2006, when the army moved Brother Yinglak Chinawat Taxin from the position of Prime Minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has often ensured their success in the elections.
However, many middle-class and capital elites had entered the anti-government movement, which had almost paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one ever said it would be better at the mercy salad, I didn't promise you, it's a Palm waitress.
It has to be formally acknowledged that this is true, but the mind and the stomach are still intact.
After all, we've known for a long time that we're saying "Belgium" -- that is, we're saying "mics" -- we're saying "Belgium."
The reporters love to say with deep intent that the success of the institution depends on three factors: education, education and once again the culture.
There are places not that are good, but that are good, but that are not good enough.
Anyway, at the Palm table, I remembered that there was once a Gordock coffee here (in honour of the same TV show), then a Odessa Mam, and a Boola restaurant and a Drjba beer.
Now it's beer, but it's no longer no nostalgic-Soviet, it's Belgian.
The only place above the ground was the top of the iceberg, the barbed pole and the pair of tables, the rest of the space being cut down even by the sun.
It's fun here, but it's like in a child's room: red, yellow and green walls, multi-colored chairs, instead of windows, televisions, where they float.
Belgian institutions in Petersburg are far from new, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight species of spilling beers (260-300 roubles per 0.5 l) and countless bottles (170-1550 roubles).
Company-positive waitresses are fun to present a menu saying that "mics are large seeds", and it should be noted that it is the services that, despite the few shortcomings, are the most positive part of Palm.
The menu is expected to be kept, but it is often very unexpected.
Who, for example, is warned that the meat roll with the Walloon nun (280 roubles) is actually carpaccho, while it is so thin that the parchment paper will appear to the mother in comparison to it as if it were fat.
You can only taste it if you burn it together.
The salads are worse.
Classical Lesgow (260) would be best recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: a kind of a fire-burning iceberg, once unfrozen potatoes once upon a time, which had been scattered by Kenyan beans, bacon kernels plus a marinated bow.
You don't want to meet anybody with this lion's salad!
The Belgian salad component was somewhat different, but the impression was not different either.
If it was still possible to close the eyes of unappreciated quarters of the wombs or the overheated champagnes, why, it would appear that the midlights had been able to crack and digest several times in their lifetime!
I already know that there are perfectly normal Belomores here!
They're put in pots of "in sauce to your choice" (490-560 roubles per 0.5 kg).
The sauce of half a dozen, the white wine, the selery, and the carrots, was not really out of the way.
There's food, and there's no aroma, and whether there's wine there or if it's still a mystery.
But the good ones are the jades with the mayo homerone.
The chicken veerose here is not a groovy, thick so much that, depending on the mood, you can decide, the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice plumbing soup.
It was stated that the rabbit was preparing a local cook in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about the ravine.
On the floor, the situation was far from the opposite: Rasmarine choked everything.
It seemed that this rabbit in life was fed exclusively with pink shrubs, which produced such an uncanny aroma.
But at the same time, a rabbit was attached to a wonderful foot -- no, just a rudimentary pear in a caramelized shortness.
The Palm waffles are offered not only sweet, but also succulent, with beef, chicken, or bacon, and cheese (220 - 280).
The maple sauce proved to be too watery, and the waffles were dry.
But a manager who came to the table asked about her lunching experiences very informally.
So, you should come again.
The dollar course is above 37 roubles on news of new West sanctions against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar for the calculation of tomorrow's "day" by 10:29 moss of growth of 26.9 roubles, which amounted to 37.02 roubles, the euro rose by 30 copies - to 48.73 roubles - as evidenced by the Moscow Exchange data.
The bone basket grew by 28 copies to the level of its previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Prior to the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum of 19 February 2009, at which point it was 36.43 roubles and on 3 March 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that U.S. President Barack Obama and Chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The reduction of the rub is of a long-term nature, both in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast implied this, says Senior Alpari analyst Anna Bodrov.
Everything connected with Ukraine will, in one way or another, be reflected in the course.
As long as this goes on, investors will react.
Today, rumours about the military invasion have not been confirmed on any one side, but the market has proved to be very emotional.
All the talk that he kept up with such news was cancelled yesterday.
One week, the specialist is projected to close at those levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period ended, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, and the transit of gas through Ukraine is all a link to one chain.
Inflation is also projected, from 5 to 10 per cent of current autumn prices.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will soon end, and there will be some vacuum while networks are being diverted to other suppliers.
"Dollar approached the mark at 37 rubles, passed it and came back, and there is no powerful hysterics," comments the head of the Market Analysis Division, Exposing the Brokers, Constantine Bush.
It will still be seen whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO sits.
The Rubl, he said, was sharply weakened after the tax season was over, followed by news in Ukraine, and the CB last week stated that by the end of the year it had completely moved to a floating course and refused to have any currency intervention.
If you look at the day-to-day order, it's no different from the previous one this month, and you're afraid of it at 37 roubles, and the analyst continues.
And yes, nothing powerful has happened in terms of trafficking.
The alarming times for the currency market were, I remember, when there was increased demand for currency at the end of January, as well as the third, when the CB shipped the record number of currencies.
The FIU also sees the positive side of the wheel mitigation.
First of all, this increase in the income portion of the export budget, as well as the increased competitiveness of domestic producers through more expensive imports, says the Chief UFS analyst Alexey Cozzlow.
The travel of imported goods and services may be negative.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, fuel the rise in inflationary pressures and, consequently, cause the borrowing of money to be more expensive, which, in turn, hampers the economic development of the country.
In terms of the stock market, the depreciation of roubles is somewhat counterproductive to the lower prices of shares expressed in roubles.
For example, the MBIB Trade Index fell by 1.67 per cent and the RTA index lost 3.27 per cent.
A significant difference in the relative drop in indices is due to more than 1.5 per cent in the day.
The weakening of rubella is emotional and is due to a widespread desire to buy currency.
The practice has shown that emotions are gradually gone and that the wheel boilers are partially or completely recuperating the lost positions.
"We believe that soon we can see the ratio between the dollar and the Russian currency near the 36 roubles per dollar," notes Alexey Cozlow.
Genetic violation is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years thinking she would die after a misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charco-Marie-Tuta (SITC) disease, a group of hereditary disturbances that resulted in nerve damage outside her brain and spine.
A charity organization, CMT UK, reported that the diagnosis was not well established - a common problem among people with ITC, because it was not so well known.
Some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are said to have CMTs that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, faulty step-by-steps and icy toes.
The sick may feel a vaccinate or pain, and the condition is not healed and progressing, which means that symptoms are increasing over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the Friedreh (AF) attack, a condition that was very bad.
Rogers thought she would be tied to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she would die before she turned 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew child I couldn't do what others did.
I fell down every day, and everything took longer.
I could never ride or skateboard with other kids, and I had a lot of fun at school because of how I was going and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13 years old, after several operations to release her Achilles tendon and to turn her back, she looked at the medical map when her doctor left the room and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty, because I'd put my nose down, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, I found information about this condition in the library, and I wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shaken and tried the most terrible panic that was possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and I would die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my ability in this space.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she had realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and had asked her doctor about it.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic surveys, ITC was found.
"When he explained what ITC was like, I thought I had a happy ticket," she said.
The British ITC charity organization has declared a month of information on ITC to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on businesses in Washington D.C. is growing as the economy is restored
The emerging economy means more clients, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies throughout the country increased moderately last year, when economic recovery was accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and in the Washington Zone, there is no exception.
District companies, Maryland and Virginia have paid a total of $276.6 billion to the state and local government treasury in 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local business increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after one year when accounts decreased in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent according to a research carried out by a professional service firm, Erst & Young, and the State Tax Centre, a tax policy team.
Over half of the tax revenue in the district, 56 per cent, is taxed by entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland tax revenue is paid by firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, brings the least tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues is due to the return to the value of the company, says researchers, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years, when growth was less than 1 per cent.
While large numbers of these revenues are in large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is true in the Washington zone.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia have paid $10 billion in real estate and local taxes in the previous year, an increase of $9.6 billion over 2012 of 4.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return of property value has no similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one fifth of the company ' s tax accounts.
Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half of the State and Local Tax Accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's going on in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to a non-profit organization that does not pay the real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Centre.
Maryland thus has a lot more to rely on, for example, income taxes to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully attributed to the re-establishment of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs' income also seems to be coming to an adjustment, according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared a corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate revenue from income taxes, most in the region.
While trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
The rate of growth in the District of Colombia was the same as the country average, 4.3 per cent, while Maryland growth was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia experienced an increase in tax revenues below the average of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with an equal corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is a relatively high rate of 9.975 per cent.
A recent study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that Virginia had lower taxes on state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate for business taxes than Maryland.
The district wasn't appreciated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia faces competitive pressure from its neighbour from the south.
The North Carolina has recently signed legislation reducing the corporate rate from 6.9 per cent this year to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continued to meet its tax objectives next year, it could have resulted in an income tax rate for entrepreneurs even up to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington Zone seems to be feeling better and thus paying more State and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs, paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners, are a transitional structure where most small firms -- in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia -- have grown by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much faster growth rate than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in income from business taxes throughout the country will likely continue this year, with government and local taxes rising by 6.2 per cent over the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may fall behind, as lower federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
Russian judo Bronze Age
Two silver and seven bronze prizes were offered by the Ododo home championship.
From this point the Russians withdrew only the Japan - collected competition, the main favorite.
It started on Monday, and the first day I brought to the Russian silver medal team.
It was owned by Beslan Beslan of the Wise, up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the final fight against the Boldbaater, Hanbat, from Mongolia, decided on only one point from a Russian point of view.
On the second day, the tournament became the most successful for Russia’s assembled one, and on Tuesday, three medals were conquered.
Mikhail Pulaev and bronze Kamalal Khan Magomedov were the men's contests of up to 66 kg of silver.
In the final link, the Russians gave up the 2011 and 2013 championship of the world to Japan Masasi Ebinumam.
Han-Mahmadov, in a fourth stage lost a compatriot, was victorious in a comfort tour, and became a holder of a bronze award.
In the women ' s tour of the category 52 kg, Natalya Kusbotin also received honor until the third stage of the pedestal.
In the semi-final area, she lost the current world champion, Mailynde Kelmendi, from Kosovo, who was under the flag of the International Federation of judo and had successfully defended the title.
In a dispute over bronze, Kuzutina won Ma Inan from China, but after the end of the tournament, she admitted that the third place was not what she expected.
Once again, the Russians were on their way to the gold of the Kellmendi, who had defeated Kuzthein earlier in the finals of the European championship.
On the third day of the tour in Chelabinszka, bronze was placed in a copy of Russia’s collection by Moussa Chishkov, who was fighting in categories up to 73 kg.
In the fourth place, he was offended by the former representative of Moldaviya, Victor Skovorts, who is now in favour of the UAE team.
But then the Russian won two fights and won the prize.
He played home championships with the trauma of a nunostopa, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he'll take a pause in the competitions.
As for Szvortsov's ex-molens, he and he went to the bronze medal on this tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots who had adopted the AE sports nationality, Ivan Remarenko, with bronze, completed his statement in the category up to 100 kg.
On the fourth day of the FM-2014, the Russians also received one bronze, which in the category of up to 81 kg conquered Ivan Nihont.
In the small final battle, he made a victory over Frenchman Alan Schmitt by making a comment with a rival.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played on the tournament, but the Russians were traditionally confined to one bronze in a male tournament up to 90 kg.
A Russian-assembly medal guaranteed to be the owner of Cyril Question, whose rival at the comfort final was Kirill Denisov’s associate.
However, there had not been any disruption: the rival in question could not reach his father's office because of the injury.
The male bronze was won by the masters and on the sixth day the contest was made by Renata Saidov, who was in the category over 100 kg.
In the comforting finale, he won a pure victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended an individual part of the world’s firstry.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelabinsk, Sunday, the names of the world's champions were played in team competitions.
Both Russian collections - male and female - were among the top winners of the prize, but, like individual contests, beautiful women were not fortunate - they had not reached the medal.
But then Russian judoists conquered the command silver.
In a decisive confrontation, they have given the Japanese team the highest priority in the hard fight against the 2-3 account.
Russia's collection was 2-0 after the pure victory of Khan-Magomedov and left-hand Denis Jartsov (hung up to 73 kg).
In the heavier weight categories, however, Mourat Khabachev (81), Mahomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope with Japanese rivals.
In the same scenario, a bronze match developed in a women's tournament, where the Russian assembly was 2-0 and gave up to the Japanese -- 2-3.
The president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, was present at the command competitions in Chelabinske, who, after the end of the tournament, congratulated the male assembly with the silver.
"The second place is very honourful, but I want to say that it was evident that you could be champions," said Putin, quoted by RIA, "The News."
Lose the Japanese, judo's parents, nothing's out here.
But I'm sure you can win them.
Russia's assembly at the world's home championships was far better than it was a year ago at a competition of such a level that took place in Rio de Janeiro.
Then there were only three medals in the asset of the Russian team - one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the Olympic championships of Arsen Galstan and Mansour Isaev were missed.
We're all, of course, big perfectionists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember, if the Olympics guy is in the top eight, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
In the same way as judo, the Minister for Sports of the Russian Federation, RF Vitaly Mutko, brought out the words of the champion's press service.
Japan’s congregation was expected to be the best in Chelabinsk, with 11 medals of various dignity, five of which were gold.
The next championship of peace will take place next summer in Astana.
Other material, news, and statistics can be found on the page of summer sports.
The family, Joan Rivers, hopes for a better one.
Joan Rivers is unconscious when she comes to the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed her hope today that the 81-year-old comedy will recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday, following an emergency call that she had had a heart arrest at a clinic in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopes, reporting sources.
The doctors deliberately keep her under drug control and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “hard”.
The response was wide, including numerous Internet support from such as Donald Trump, Montelle Williams and Kelly Ripe.
Everyone will be able to make kings.
To sell the debut album of the band Royal Blue, a new hope for the British river, which led rock duts out of a straight club at the stadium.
Duet Royal Blade is on stage for a year, but already has an active face-to-face for BBC music, a tour that warms up at Archic Monkeys, and a visit to the makeup of New York concert by Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut single album, a few months before the release, received 100,000 prosthetics, and the contract for its release is in the Warner Music portfolio.
Given the current sad situation in the music market, the situation is coming out of a row, because it's not about the new Lane Del Rey, or the next sweetest voice to introduce the new R'n'B, but about the duality of the British who play with the level of volume and intensity, which was most recently in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the rates for the first album for all the above circumstances were particularly high and had already been fully justified.
The Dudet had taken a name that they thought they had had before, unless they had the most desperate hairy metal, and the blood of what kings seemed to be flowing in their veins was understandable.
This is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the last Level Leed Zeppelin: like a large quartet, Royal Blod seeks to shake the blood of the British river into a new height.
To make predictions about the enterprise's success so far, perhaps early, but something can be confirmed.
A dozen songs made in thirty and a little minutes are not so much a demonstration of phenomenal creative gifts, but a sure and powerful declaration of intentions.
It's not possible to deny some of the virtues of certain numbers, of course, that the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is something that is remembered by the drum band, not by the melodic line.
In a joke, the musicians say that this song is easier to catch than to drink.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and closing a plate of "Better Strangers" with a shespire quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each song will sound great at a heavy - year - old favorite party, but when they lose, they merge into more or less homogeneous canvass.
And that's not necessarily bad, not even the other way around.
The Force Royal Blade is that they don't pretend to be the lairs of the new Lennon and McCartney (they soon see their successor Motörhead), but they've taken a lot of rock duts out of the patto turkey clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity created for the stadiums, is in a room of fewer than a few thousand people, obviously close.
The secret is part of the subtle use of bass, which replaced the guitar with the usual format designed at the beginning of zero.
But it's not just about tools, it's about making songs.
Heroes of the no-one retrospect have gone beyond the post-moderist paradigm with great reluctance to go beyond the epigons, but rather the autonomous creative units.
Royal Blade, on the other hand, now sounds so powerful and so powerful that some of the secondaryity and hardness of the music material is becoming successful.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON had just confirmed what Information had been said on Friday morning: an online bag and a video producer, and a hundred other things, it was buying the Twitch stream services for $1.04 billion.
This was a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected that YouTube would be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Google's Twitch video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and the combination looked natural.
Twitch, based just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a general stream service, a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, he quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their internal moments; YouTube for real-time games, according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And the "let's play", the video director, in which everybody gives (mainly old) a game of processing, like in "Taine Theatre," is already popular on YouTube.
The point is that YouTube is mentioned often when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met with no particular interest, a classic example of a well-established technology company that buys out a potential competitor.
It's a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from Executive Director Twitch Emmet Shira, "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another mystery, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snoboms like me who say they're gonna do sports better than watch it, it's hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking into their own hands a joystick.
It's one thing to look through a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. when she crawls through the Resident Eville, and another thing is to see how some outsider gets 20 shots in the head of the Call of Doty in a row.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are one person, so watching them without controlling the angle of vision itself can be a recipe for a major pain worth Do it Right.
I agree that the rapid walk in which Rogers Bennisters of our electronic age finish their game at record time is fun.
But if it's not a game or a game of humor, it's unlikely that its Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics know about me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and it's the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly would Amazon make a difference?
It's hard to imagine Twitch going back to Amazon Advanced Video just as pretty as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
Twitch, however, has something that any company would be pleased to have: a crowd of young men who are dreamt of by advertisers.
As chap. Twitch Shire, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of the game," and this can't be a sign of the fallout, even -- oh -- like a visual sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed as a result of the 2004 terrorist attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to surviving hostages -- almost everyone now -- with the parents of the deceased, the cemetery keeper -- the City of Angels, Ramon Castaltov, the head of the Mothers of Beslan of Sussan Dudev, who was involved in the special operation by a member of the MCS, says the company correspondent Elizabeth Antonov, who worked on a special project.
Assambek Aslahanov, who 10 years ago was president's adviser to the North Caucasus and was negotiating terrorists, as well as Russian FSB officer Vacheslav Bocharov, met in Moscow.
What particularly shocked me about the time I was working on this topic is that there was no 10-year-old in Beslan.
This is a very painful topic for all who have any connection with it, and people find it difficult to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we did our task,' said Antonova.
A special project has been prepared by a research studio of the Rimbler & Co., which has been working in a company since the spring of this year.
The previous special projects were devoted to the First World War and to the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
The DPRK launched a small-range missile
North Korea launched small-range missiles in the Japanese Sea area, reports Renhaap.
The launch took place about 10.30 a.m. on the side of Chaganda, a North Korean and China border.
The rocket was reportedly dropped into the Japan Sea, flying some 220 kilometres, and declared before the Joint Committee of South Korea Chiefs of Staff.
Members suggested accelerating the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, the Russians will not be kept on servers abroad as of 1 January 2015
The State has introduced a draft law which provides for the transposition of the date of entry into force of the Act on Personal Data from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower chamber.
It was sponsored by the Presidents of the State of the State of Vadim Dydgin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedrov (the only Russian Federation), Vladimir Parakhin (Russia) and Alexander Yushenko (CPR).
This change, in the view of the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more rapid and effective exercise of the rights of the citizens of the Russian Federation to the preservation of personal data and to the observance of the secrecy of communications and information networks.
The law to which parliamentarians rush into force requires that Russia ' s personal data be stored in the territory of the Russian Federation through the Internet.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, collect, store, refine and extract personal data from the citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located in Russian territory, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law empowers the Roskkonador to restrict access to information that is processed in violation of the Russian Federation personal data law.
The Act also suggests the creation of so-called blacklists of violators sites - an automated information system, the Register of Personal Data Violators.
The Act was adopted by the State during the summer.
Andrey Lugovo and Vadim Daygin of LDPR and Alexander Yushenko of CRC/CPR were the sponsors of the bill.
Daygin and Yushenko are also one of the sponsors of the current bill to postpone the date of entry into force of the law.
People who don't have PF-centres, they'll have to pay for rent.
Commenting on the draft bill introduced in the State Duma today, the first replacement of the Thought Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, stated that he saw no problem in moving the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
He said that those companies that, by 1 January 2015, would not have their own personal data storage facilities in the Russian Federation could rent them, for example, "Rosechcom," which said on several occasions that they were willing to rent their servers and already provide their servers, from the Mail Group, from western companies that are already providing their servers."
"There are also several independent data centres that are willing to cooperate in this field," he added.
"If the company decides to comply with the law and continue working in the territory of the Russian Federation, I don't see any problem; they'll have the technology to house," said Levin.
Conservative Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed its concern that if the draft law was adopted, the Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, these are the services for the online monitoring of airline tickets and hotels.
According to the association, “the draft legislation deprives the citizens of the individual data - citizens of the right to dispose of their own data - in a mandatory manner, determining that their recording, systematization, etc. must be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC declaration emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user where the recording is carried out, and to systematize his or her personal data.
In such a case, it will be possible to choose which territory the said acts will take place.
Such laws on “localization” of personal data in other countries have led to global services and substantial economic loss.

Departures handed over to Ukrainian military more than 400 prisoners
At Novorossi, the army alleged to have hit Ukrainian Su-27 and accused the enemy of violating the ceasefire
At 10:00 on 1 September, the militia handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded and 35 dead soldiers.
The representative of the media service, "The Army of Novorossi", informed the Interfax.
He added that “by air at the town of Merečka, the Su-27 aircraft violated the cease-fire arrangement”.
According to the agency's interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions under the shelling of Luhan Airport.
The representative of the press pointed out that the militias had managed to damage two Ukrainian military helicopters during the night in one of the field airfields, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The death of the enemy's living force - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, surrendered to 13 persons," summarized the headquarters representative.
Interfax does not have evidence from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, Donbasa ' s armed groups of the People ' s Republics claimed to be handed over to the Ukrainian side within the framework of the ceasefire of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the Ukrainian National Guard.
At the same time, during the night, the NAM army, according to Novovorossi Army, “suffered an attempt by the Nazi people to withdraw heavy equipment from the area, in violation of previous agreements”.
At that time, militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 troops.
According to the headquarters, the total loss of the enemy on all tracks (Dotsk, Luhansk, Mariupleska) during the night amounted to five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, more than 120 persons killed and injured.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers found themselves surrounded by militias in the Iloweska area of Donetsk.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia asked the leaders of the “national republics” to release Ukrainian troops from the environment.
In the NAMA, they agreed to do so subject to the delivery of weapons and ammunition by the enemy.
The first dozens of troops began leaving surrounding areas on Saturday morning.
According to Simeon Semenchenenko, a member of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion, another 14 people left the “cotla” on Sunday.
In his Facebook report, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded people are “in captivity at 137 in the 32-D.F. Divisional 32 and 9-D.D. Brigade of the Russian Federation” where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia denied reports by Ukrainian military and NATO of the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Russia will respond to new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to respond to the protection of its legitimate interests in the event of the new anti-Russian sanctions, and reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A communication from the Russian external authority states that the European Council's “concludations” of 30 August demonstrated the failure of the EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their clear support to the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in the east of Ukraine, drawing on “an uncontested statement of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of that country”, is cited on the website of the authorities.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regrets that the European Union, against the interests of its member States, is influenced by countries that are interested in strengthening confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Union should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, as well as the provision of conditions for full “the dialogue between the opposing parties”, stresses the institution.
It is also noted on the agency web site that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbasa, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has occurred, as well as an increasing number of casualties among the civilian population.
We recall that, during the next seven-day period in the European Union, concrete proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation are planned.
At the same time, EU representatives cooperate closely with American officials.
They are expected to indicate the correlation between the measures imposed for the period of operation and the degree of severity.
The new European Union sanctions may affect the energy and financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Bad ways to save in university textbooks
Although the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $10,000 a year, Matt Schröder, who will soon be able to take his second course, has come up with a clever way of reducing costs.
It has developed a system of how to rent books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation so that they can delay their sale.
"My mathematical analysis textbook, which is usually $180, I got at the school for $10 and Crick-fill-A cookies," says Schröder, 19 years old, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The literature needed in the last class would be $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Board, a secondary student spends more than $1200 a year on textbooks and educational supplies, but students have a number of options for reducing these costs.
Students are increasingly selecting Internet jerseys and creative ideas like Schröder's.
The rolling of books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use books over the course of a seed and is often much cheaper than buying them.
Nibo Incorpetide, a company owned by more than 250 university bookshops, reports that the volume of missing books has doubled since 2011.
The industry studies show that about a quarter of the books in university bookshops during the last spring's seed have been rented, says Trevor Meyer, Vice-President Nebo.
Less than half of all books are purchased at university bookshops, according to the professional association National Association of University Shops.
Here's an introductory course on best ways to make a good deal.
Procurement at the Internet Shop
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book could be one third of what you'll see at a university bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostettler, ninth edition, is worth about $290 per pre-pre-scurricant, but a new copy can be obtained from $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of the late one
If you don't mind a stranger's marks or injuries, the books used are a good option.
"Mathematic Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in a used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Kesday, 25, a fourth-year-old student from Brigham Young University, says that he paid for Amazon.com 42 cents for a copy of "Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding Business of Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48 new.
Professors, for example, Ingrid Bracey, director of the College Without Wall at Massachusetts University in Emhrersta, invite students to make sure that previous publications are not available.
Sometimes updating is not important for class.
In such cases, old publications are often found in a very small percentage of the value of the latter.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, belonging to eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to the purchase of used books.
Passage
To rent textbooks, you might want to think about it if you have enough to treat them, remember to get them back, and do not want to leave them behind after the course is over.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of the new book.
For example, one student was able to hire a "Mathematic Analysis" on a seed class for about $20.
Explain the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you can write as notes, emphasises, and injuries.
If you rent a book, remember that if you do not return the book, fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books own the rent, acquired by electronic licences for a certain period of time, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" option on the Chegg.com website will cost about $61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the most profitable prices, because many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, whereas natural and engineering literature can be very expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Holt, the 29-year-old who is about to start his studies at Pepperin Law School, recommends that ISBN be used to ascertain book prices, since that guarantees that you are looking for the right text for.
Before you make an order on the Internet, he says, you need to check if there's a book in the warehouse.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he acquired was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid a full price at the university bookstore.
Putin stated that the Far East Development Fund was fully ineffective
President Vladimir Putin of Russia announced at a meeting on the issue of ownership of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, established two years ago, was ineffective, reports Interfax.
"15 billion rubles remain in deposits," said the President.
During the meeting, the Head of State mandated that the list of territories for pre-development in the Far East should be expedited.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of a party should be introduced into the Duma of the fall.
The Federal Assembly, noted the President, did not adopt, until 1 July, a list of the territories ahead of development in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also set out the main objectives for the development of the Far East.
Among them, improving the region ' s transport accessibility, removing infrastructure constraints, both in the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create opportunities to attract additional investment in the region, as well as to form areas of pre-development that should become competitive vis-à-vis key business centres at ART, the President emphasized.
It was recalled that it was previously reported that the area of pre-development could be replaced by afE.
Why Dooms of the galaxy failed to save cash collection
"Unreasonable 3" Sylvester Stalinon returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget in the United States, whereas "The City of Sins: a woman for whom it is worth killing" returned only $12 million from her 70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz brought home "Best Videos" only $1.4.6 million in the first weekend, whereas children's movies like "How to Hand Dragon 2" also disappointed.
The article of a movie critic, Telegraphy Robbie Colin, suggests that when it comes to children ' s films, it may be that they are not the only ones who are the children.
Collin called 2014 the worst year in the history of children's films, and he called it "How to improvise dragon 2" with barely a "functioning" continuation.
However, when it comes to films directed at a somewhat older audience, the problem does not necessarily appear to be the same as the movies themselves.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings for CinemaScor and Metacritic for every film released in the summer of at least 2,000 copies between May and July 20, 2013 and 2013.
The results, which take into account the opinions of both filmmakers and movie critics, suggest that this year ' s film crop is sized to last year ' s hits.
Some commentators suggest that it can be a matter of changing spectator habits and increasing popularity of web-based Internet services, such as Netflix.
The director, John Favro, who is currently working on the soon-running dysnaev movie "The Jungle Book" said to the Hollywood Reporter's website, "I think times change."
We must recognize this and not try to pursue what was earlier.
Unlike the current fall in Hollywood cash collection, Netflix’s income from stream services reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spilberg criticized the studio for putting too much trust in comedy's franchise and predicting Hollywood's edges.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that his grim predictions had a share in the truth.
In the summer of 2015, a number of potential cash caches are expected to be released, including “Mest members: Er Altrona”, “Mignonov” and “Yur Park”, other film industry representatives are more optimistic.
The producer of Human X, Simon Keinberg, recently called the fall of cash collection, simply "cycle," said Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the greatest cash summer in history, and no one will be worried about it."
Productive sanctions do not scare the owners of the institutions with Caucasus and Central Asian food, but for European and Japanese kitchen restaurants, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And generally, the general demand is still preferred to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There's a nice little gannet than a bad monarch," says Italian restaurant Bharlotti, Marloty Mariano Valerio, for the quality of the cheeses offered by suppliers to him in exchange for Italian.
The mosarell and cheese burgle ended in the first restaurant, they've got a little storage time.
The parmeseline reserve must be enough for a few more months.
What's to be done?
You're moving to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear that his shocking memories still do not let him go.
The meat was only 20 inches [30 cm] from the floor!
There's cats out there!
Chris!
Then I said for our restaurant, we're never going to buy anything from Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's been different now.
But the other day, they brought me a fish from the Far East.
That's how she was so stupid!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought us this.
Valerio is surprised to learn that many of the things that are common to Italy for a Russian manufacturer in a wild beast.
A few years ago, I had to buy a Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in the refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1 to 2 degrees.
It has to hang out to get soft so that the muscles relax.
I did all of this with the local beef.
And then they asked me, "Where did you get such gentle meat?"
I said, it's yours, Russian!
Why don't you do that?
Five minutes to walk from Barlotti at the French restaurant "Brasserie Most" in the kitchen hanging stop leaf, which shows missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The head of the restaurant "Brasserie Most" and the "Strell" bar Regis Trigel are not as pessimistic as Valerio: the French-based oysters have already been replaced by the Tunisian oysters, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
But then Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers:
I say, "Why is it so much on what basis?"
I'm told, "Well, we should make a living too."
But this capure doesn't have to cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy the Far East oysters by weight, but they live 15 to 20 years, you know, how much do they weigh?
At the price, it's a super-delucate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of intimidation for foreign cooks.
The standard story is, "The first three months everything was good, and then quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibre and quality.
Many restaurants in the European kitchen don't know what's going to happen when supplies of cheese are finished.

The competent menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of separate economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is mainly referred to as food sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, lead, meat and subproducts from the domestic bird, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurts, works, cheeses, vegetables, fruit, nuts, bulbs and sugar syrups.
Restaurant restaurants have started with suppliers: the prices of food have grown, and there is an urgent need to look for analogies from other countries.
This will have a major impact on expensive restaurants with monoecines in France, Italy, Spain, to which products were shipped directly from “material” countries.
They had to get better earlier.
For example, when Roselhozardzor banned the import of Australian beef in early 2014, it was a year before that of American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers provided beef supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of summer 2014 have been much more severe.
It is true that on 20 August, Prime Minister Demetrius Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which would result in the prohibition of Atlantic salmon and trout, free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and beads for crops.
The Italian woman Valerio hoped that sanctions could still be reduced.
In the meantime, part of the restaurants are in uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of HoReCa's largest suppliers, the share of imports in the pre-eminent segment was 70 per cent.
"Dear Restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries do," says Sergey Mironov, a Rector, the owner of the Restconsalt.
If the boss's strong, it won't be a problem for him.
We only have very few of these cooks, and the new menu can take two or three months.
A trip from the Brasserie Moste restaurant is ready: you're going to have to give up 10-15% of the dish, you're going to have to recycle half of the menu.
Mushroom restaurants are already starting to replace dishes, such as marmot beef steaks - to beefstrogans, says Sergey Mironov.
“Syra from Europe may be replaced by Russian, Belarusian raw materials, raw materials from Serbia, Argentina, Chile, Tunisia,” enumerates Oxana Glibchuk, representative of East-West.
The plums and milk products from Europe have similar products in Russia and Belarus.
A hen from the United States may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seed from Norway - salmon, seed, fora from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the production of domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironova, the budget for the network restaurant is simpler than the pre-eminent segment: it is unlikely that there was a gourmet that could distinguish the Italian monarch from the Russian one.
Although it's hard for Ginza Project institutions, he thinks.
Ginza Project several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their menu.
"Mironov says, "It's going to take a lot of time to replace him."
Ginza rejected the comments, referring to the absence of owners in the country.
Café owners of the Caucasus and Central Asian kitchens stress that products from the former Soviet republics smell better than European products.
But a lot of restaurants that don't touch sanctions.
These include institutions from CIS kitchens: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive foods in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatun Kolbay, owner of the Superavi Georgian restaurant, and a cafe of the Wy Mae.
All the cheeses do for us in Russia, and we don't use the exotic greens as the basis for many dishes.
No dish has yet been removed from the menu in Kolbai institutions.
Tyra of Lane, the owner of Chayhon N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchen, and the sanctions are not embarrassing: they only have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia manages to import from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe,” he says.
CIS makes it cheaper to get a cut, a lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.
But what comes from Central Asia is far better than a “plastics” from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes everyone knows they're delicious, sweet.
No one's talking about Spanish.
Following the imposition of the sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Justice of Uzbekistan, Olymba Articov, stated that he planned to double the export of fruit products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports into Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Restaurants who responded to Deneg's request, too, are quite calm in responding to sanctions.
McDonald's Press stated that the localization was more than 85% and the network was working with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanov, head of department working with suppliers Subway Russia, about 80 per cent of the products are being purchased by the network in Russia, although the supply of vegetables and rising prices of meat products produced from imported raw materials may present temporary difficulties.
The "Tremme" did not have more than 4 percent of the "Sunish" stuff at all.
They didn't hurt the sanctions or the Laundry Wocker.
KFC, Burger King and Little Cartoska did not respond to the "Deneg" request, but other market participants argue that the localization of Burger King is significantly less than McCDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, Rectors are willing to buy more Chilean than Russian Far East
On my hottie.
In the meantime, the reporters complain that prices are growing even for local products because of rising demand.
"For the "Grabley" products, prices grew by an average of 10 to 15 per cent, and for the Italian restaurant, "Cherry Mio", twice," says President Roman Rozhnikovski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, five to 10 per cent of the cost of the dish grows, recognizing Kolbaya.
The east-west of that doesn't deny that, "For example, Belarusian milk products have travelled 10 to 15% since the beginning of August."
"The Brazilian suppliers raised their lead prices almost twice as much, "he complains to the Deputy Director-General of Stardogs.
The chicken fruit was 35% traveler.
Waiting for the prices of China, they may be cooled by Brazilian heads.
The Star Dougs will soon have a planned 8% increase in prices.
It's now very undesirable to raise prices, says Ruck.
According to statistics, the increase in the profit for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
The variable prices will continue to rise, he acknowledges, but it is not clear how quickly, as long as most reporters are stocked with food for the next two months, hoping to cross the purchase price.
But what happens in two months is nobody knows.
The square in front of the city of Moscow has a dozen tents decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the stage, musicians play waltz.
It's a festival of regional products with the cheerful title "There is time."
"We've been going to do a local food holiday for a long time, and here's the sanctions, we're in a hurry, we're organizing a festival," says one of the organizers.
Outside of the stage with the musicians, Greek cook Anastas is preparing macaron salads and home concerts, there was a day-long master class to prepare a box with carmatized apples.
All of the Russian products, believe the organizers.
The chess shows the achievements of the Russian people's farm.
Honey from Buckaryia, deer from Salihard, vegetables from the submixed Lenin Berry, cheese from the wrecked Italian, Jaya Clouse.
"For restaurants, you can safely replace another salmon fish with the Far East," says Philip Galkin, the owner of his own fish shop.
We've got the neur, the cat, the husk, the pumpkin, the flicker, the flicker, the salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because it's wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is an aquaculture.
You take him in, he won't even move.
And our Far East salmon you won't hold in your hands.
Only institutions with no specific claims agree to replace Italian monarchs with domestic
His tent is lined with shrimp with a set of Magadan, cod, mellow, martyrs with Crimea, platters from the Far East.
Galkin is confident that it is high time to cross fish from the Far East.
Statistics show that the catch of fish in Russia in 2013 is over 4 million tons, and that a large part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
Lavka "His People" has been selling fish through an Internet bag since 2012, before the sanctions were imposed, another one-and-a-half restaurants, for example, simple stuff.
Now, another 15 restaurants have been applied to Galkin.
We can make the same land out of our fish, and it's hot.
We got stuck, we tried different prescriptions.
We're selling it over an Internet bag per million roubles a month.
Our fish are several times cheaper, and our delivery is a maximum of 15 roubles per kg.
I'm being prepared for the rescue of the Philadelfia with the Cat, in support of Galkin's tent.
Unlike the fish of the seed, these have had to chew for a longer time, but they are aware that this fish is our domestic fish.
There's even rolls of a stick and a sea-eye on the website of their own people.
In Sushi bar, it is true that Norwegian salmon is replaced by Chilean.
Hulkin explains this because the lazi make new prescriptions with far east fish.
"The Russian fish suppliers have not yet been offered to us," gives their explanation to the owner of Killfish Bar Demetrius Evesev.
About the same situation with other products: Russian producers could have taken an released niche, but that would not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the Lavkalavka Borys Akimova project, it is more possible to talk about import from Europe and America by importing from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with high logistics and volume.
They are able to use banned imports quickly, unlike our farmers.
That is to say, major producers of other countries will win the ban in the first place,” Akimam says.
At the same time, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal in the last month than the food sanctions.
As a result of the large-scale extracurricular checks, the three McDonald's and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg have been suspended.
“We study the substance of the claims submitted to determine the actions necessary for the speedy opening of restaurants for visitors”, stated the Days in the McDonald press service.
No one really knows what's going to happen.
If everyone is restricted to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says, under the conditions of anonymity, a company consulting the restaurant.
If you start closing McDonald's all over the country, the script will be different.
Europrotok instead of HYBDE reference
Cash payments will be available without a HYBDD certificate, so the CB intends to encourage the introduction of Europrototopics in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has drawn up a draft instruction according to which, as of 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to do without a HYBD certificate.
It is true that this is only when the accident was made for the Europrotocol without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two vehicles were involved in the accident, no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the set limit and both drivers agreed on who was the perpetrator of the accident.
Since 2 August, payments for Europrotocol amount to 50,000 roubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad districts, it will be increased to 400,000 roubles.
The point is that, often even with minor injuries, in a situation where an accident can be caused by Europrotocol, the DPS causes the driver to cause the accident.
After all, if there was a policy of cash collection, it was not possible to obtain compensation without the certification of HYBD.
The parameters set out in the draft directive are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of Europrototopics in Russia.
According to them, the maximum cash allowance for a GID-free accident should not be lower than the limit for a Europrobe.
However, it cannot be higher than the limit defined in the cash insurance contract.
An idea of course is useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the staff of DPS and the roads.
But it is likely that no motorists or insurers will be excited about it.
The latter have already demonstrated a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new caste rules.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work would have to be done to overcome Russian conservatism.
The driver will, in most cases, wait for inspectors for hours to make a small accident, because it's so much more reliable.
It is also not known that it will be easier to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the certainty of Europrotopics.
The savings certificate shall make an nameless and irrevocable
Minphine wants to ban savings certificates for bearers, but will allow banks to make them the equivalent of an irrevocable contribution.
Minphine is preparing a bill that will prohibit savings certificates for bearers.
Recently, the tool is becoming more popular, as the rates are higher than those in bank deposits.
The point is that savings certificates for bearers are not included in the deposit insurance system and banks are cheaper because they do not have to be credited to the Investment Insurance Agency (ACA).
The specificity of the situation is that this step is expected to be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and will be affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to ASWs, control 98 per cent of the business market.
The Bank of Moscow is estimated to be about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in AAUs, is that the customers of a small bank who bought such a certificate attempt to obtain money from the AFS if the licence was withdrawn.
Some investors may assume that their contributions are insured without having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates for bearers.
The justified lack of insurance payments on these certificates, if the licence is withdrawn by the bank, may result in misunderstandings and social tensions.
In the practice of the agency, there have been cases in which the bearers have attempted to recover the insurance compensation through the courts” as stated before the AAC.
The problem, of course, is overwhelming.
No one will pay the buyers the certificates because they have no legal right to compensation from the State.
If it was the fact that the instrument was not insured by the AER, it would also include metal bills in which citizens' funds are recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum, platelets and pallades.
After all, these accounts are not included in the deposit insurance system either, but they are not yet used by anyone.
The case is probably that the bearer ' s certificates are a very convenient paper, which could in fact serve as a quasiden.
However, their movement is almost out of control: any bank client can buy a certificate, hand it over to any citizen, and until such a certificate is cashed, it may change the number of owners.
It is not by accident stated in the bill that a savings certificate must be necessarily the very securities that should be kept in the depositary.
In order to send dust to banks, such certificates are permitted to be issued without payment.
I mean, there's a kind of irrevocable contribution that banks have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nyeport and Cardiff
The weekend was marked by protests by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport on a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff's town for what was described as an anti-samite.
Stephen Fairkow followed us through the events during the weekend and talked to the protestors who had come from everywhere, from Brigend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will place arms in Iraq to counter terrorist fighters of the “Islamic State” terrorist group, referring to the decision taken following the meeting of representatives of the Government of the FWG led by the Chancellor of Angel Merkel on 31 August.
Germany is said to be sending 30 mobile Milan anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 rifles.
The supplies will be delivered by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided that an additional Euro50 million would be allocated to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Mrs. Merkel will make a Government statement in the Bundestag on this subject.
So far, Germany has not delivered its weapons to the hotspots.
The views of the people of the FARF on the shipment of weapons to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the “Islamic State” fighters, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
A Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov was blown up by the militia
The Donetsk militia set up a Ukrainian patrol boat at the Sea of Azov, reporting on 31 August by ITAR-TAS.
According to available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Gulf near the settlements of Shirokino and Benomsnono (10-20 km east of Marigopol).
A number of Ukrainian media have reported the shooting of two coast guard boats.
It is specified that the incident took place today at 4:20 msk.
Adolescents were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
A two-year-old boy on a helicopter was taken to a safe place after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old boy went on a march shortly after noon on Sunday at Govette Lip in Blackhite.
The anxious relatives called the police about 8: 00 a.m. when they did not return home.
A search team, comprising local police officers and a rescue squad, was sent, and a couple found about 11 a.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl’s knee was damaged, and the young man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with the couple for the night, and they were picked up on the swan on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in stable condition to Blo Mauntins Hospital.
Two unions met
The Minsk Summit negotiations did not solve the problems for which they had been convened but gave birth to a new format: the first European Union people had met with the first people of the future of Eurasia
Let the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discuss a number of “extreme issues” for the first time (the situation surrounding Ukraine is not self-responsive).
Is such a structure capable of working effectively, incomprehensiblely; it is clear who removed the plums from this summit.
The questions came to mind on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians and other Jews with Europeans saw the new President Lukashenka on television.
The Belarusian leader was an example of the extreme sensitivity, a man who had just torn the jackpot off, and he planned a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maydan Lukashenka Helped
The arrival of three major European commissioners (EU ministers) in Minsk, who met Lukashenko and allowed him to give a final briefing on their behalf, is not simply the legalization of the President with a 20-year period.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full subject of European policy and as a major bearer of the Ukrainian crisis.
Dennis Meliantsov, chief analyst at Belarus’s Institute of Strategic Studies, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as it used to be.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met Tete-A-tet with Lukashenko suggests that relations with the EU will continue to defrost," he said, "The fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for a breakthrough in Belarus began well before the November Maydan in Kiev, in the summer of 2013.
“We have also achieved results with the EU — successful negotiations on the simplification of visa regime and readmissions, dialogues on modernization — enumerates the interlocutor of the Fire, and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The State has even lifted a few sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian events, their own reaction to them by the Belarusian leadership had only spurred the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, has been able to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Porosenko has been able to come to Belarus for negotiations.
On another occasion, a Belarusian leader who de jure did not recognize Crimea ' s accession to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Russian militia in Donbasa, with strictness, did not have a fight with Moscow.
Minsk has not left either the Customs Union or DKS, while the Russian airbase is located in Baranovic.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue, which was appreciated by the Belarusian experts.
The success of the Lukashenka movement in political diversification will be evident as often as Minsk is able to meet in EU+TC format.
In the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Kathryn Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expects of a new relationship.
The Spokesperson, Ashton Maya Kosjancić, simply stated that, in the face of war and peace issues, this is not a priority.
However, it was reported that the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue, with the participation of the first persons in the new format, could also be Kazakhstan.
President Noursultan Nazarbaev, in which he admitted that he had been asked personally by the representatives of the European Union, became the Kang degty for Minsk.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenka made it clear that all parties did not object to Minsk remaining the central venue for meetings both in the Russian-OSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of Heads of State and the high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” will be granted the status of a fully competent European leader who helps to solve the global problem.
The Best Friend of a European Farmer
Already, the EU delegation itself, which included European Commissions on Trade and Energy, has led to the conclusion that the main undercover of the summit is not the tragic situation in Donbase, but the economy.
Indeed, at the meeting, the timetable for future negotiations on the supply of gas and to overcome the concerns of the TC countries under the agreement on the association of Ukraine with the EU is more ambitious than peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Commissioner for Trade, Carl De Gücht, however, indicated that the EU “has come to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences rather than vice versa”.
It seems, however, that in the economy, the crisis in Ukraine will “work” for Belarus.
Its consequences - and above all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which so far is subject to sanctions, a long-awaited field of manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Mizes Research Centre, the ex-cancellate to the President of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus's ability to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation to bypass sanctions.
There are supply chains for which Vladimir Putin, at the summit, has burned Minsk.
"The initiators of these schemes," stressed Romanczuk, "The fire," are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked on supply patterns, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and have now destroyed these schemes.
The Russian business needs to do something to restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert, continues, is that many Ukrainian companies are reluctant to start production in Belarus of Ukrainian raw materials, too, with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian trading schemes can now be very needed.”
According to Romanchuca, the role of the EU and TC host is ideal for Lukashenka and for developing economic ties to Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from the sanctions were estimated at Euro5-10 billion, and that the European Commission had now offered only Euro125 million of compensation to the Agrarian Sector.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the effects on the euroferries.
This could raise the authority of Lukashenko in the EU to an unprecedented height.
State without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
But the paradox is that official Minsk, from its active role in birth, is exposed to the TC+EC format and the Belarusian leader, at a meeting with the Ukrainian colleague, stressed that Kiev was the originator of the new format.
“It was your proposal to meet together, without having failed to discuss, to make a decision with the Bay-Barath, after signing the Treaty of Association with the EU, to understand the situation that had taken place in Ukraine at the time”, he addressed Peter Porosenko to the Chambers.
On the contrary, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to rumours, was originally against Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, it has been diligently emphasized that Belarus, in organizing EU and TC interactions on its land, does not pursue beneficial objectives, but the ultimate objective of such a format is to establish a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
“It is entirely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, have put forward and advanced the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation,” said Ogonka at the Ministry of Belarus, an agency which has recently carefully selected words.
Free entry zones may appear in Moscow
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of pay-entry zones as a means of controlling the congestion of central roads, similar to other major cities of the world, and refers to the Moscow Castle on Transport of Maxim Liktashov.
Pay entry is one option that has successfully proven itself.
That's an expert opinion, we're going to have to study it, see everything minus plus.
To talk about what's been decided on this while it's early,' told Liksutov.
Zammara stressed that the experiences of Asian cities, which are similar to those of Moscow, were of great importance to the capital authorities.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of the central ring road, adding Lictsov.
The recently started construction of the Central Cycling Road is just an example of not having to pass all the traffic through Moscow.
If there was enough infrastructure to travel, you wouldn't have to have transit traffic in Moscow," said the Zammer.
Maxim Liksutov also stated that the introduction of pay - parking facilities has significantly dumped the capital streets.
And, he said, the capital authorities don't plan on what they're doing.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergey Sobian, took part in the construction ceremony of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central ring road (CACAD).
A Taste of Sin
Frank Miller and Robert Rodríguez's "The City of Sins 2: A Woman for Which to Kill" had committed a different revolution from him.
The first "The City of Sin" (2005), which was withdrawn with the minimum but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between movies, comics and literary noar.
Sikwell is also revolutionized in the sense that he is destroying the basic thinking of the chain of the tesis - antithesis - synthesis (if you understand the idea of a universal nunar, or an antithesis, the space of comics).
It should now read “thesis - antithesis - chaos”.
The city of Sin II is played at both the playwright and the philosophical level: it is played in the stupid sense.
Yes, some heroes are familiar with the first Gorod, although there's Marv (Mickey of the Ruck), who remembers, ended his life on an electric chair, and there's nothing but successful in embezzling, as this popular wife, from the air of knives and other toes with wine.
But the elderly literally push out the elbows of newcomers, as if they were breaking into the city from some other movie, the meaning and the story of which the spectators are asked to not worry.
Okay, so your story, which is shamelessly torn by the authors at the most interesting place, is at Johnny's superb player, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt.
Her own is in the lusty-frigid Ewa Lord (Eva Green) and for something vengeful of her Dwight (Jos Brolin).
But this confusion in which Dwight, let's say, does not differ in face from Johnny's, especially as other parts of the body, the characters are being suffocated with unintelligible regularity, not trouble or even half-time.
They're not people, we understand that they're nuar archetypes: a rock bitch, too sure of himself, who's a guy who's been involved in a "medical trap" of a sex detective who's corrupt ass.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and the archetype chases, it's no longer a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And it's funny to ask abstract painting questions about logic.
Besides, even in this crazy world, there's something permanent.
The fighting whores of the first Gorda continue to hold a circular defense against the blackouting forces of their native slums.
Well, Detective Hartigan's ghost is not, and he'll look at the firelight, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem with the City of Sin II is another one.
Frank Miller was good at putting a comic book and nard together as a painter, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to put comics on the screen.
Comix and Nuar - two aggressively opposite "realities".
The Comix noun was born in modern form in the late 1920s, whereas Dasil Hammet's novels "Breaking of Blood" (1929), "Maltic Falsion" (1930) and "Clossion Key" (1931) created the nunar, which was then referred to as the hard-boiled school - "Closal School."
Or pulp fiction.
The comets gave Hollywood dozens of heroes, ranging from the Popai, the spinal eater, who gives him wealth, superman, Batman, and the scribbled Dick Tracy to Hulk, Tora, the Spider-Man, and other "messers".
But in any film on the basis of comic books there was something harmful: the figures, which were hard won't be able to grow the screen weight, remained the contemplatives in the surrounding will-free world of the real world.
To put it simply, they were devoid of any “resentence”.
Noir, on the other hand, is the most exotic gendarmes of the world's literature.
After the wars of the world, the traditional novel, the experiences, the characteristics, the family scandals and the historical background, lost all credibility.
What are the Forsightes, the Tibo and Rugon-Makkara, which even the Bolkonian and Rostery are the thoughts after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
The novel was peacefully mutilated in soap opera format, and criminal was defined as marginal, and the novel was raised to a philosophical level.
Hemmet on his skin has learned what it's like to work as a sanatorium on the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, there were at least close to the art and the gendarmes, such as the writers Horras McCoy and Jim Thompson, the directors of Jule Dassen, Joseph Lois, Edward Domitrick.
So the nari, whose archetype they asked, first, was rude and cynic, and second, was purely social.
Almost an American version of socialism.
The first "The City of Sin" was observed in what was unnatural, but organically linked the comic book to the nariar.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book had been reviving, not in its graphic nature, but in the form of a "reasonable" film.
The darkness of the corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered the murder, and the senator covered the hideous son of the sadest, was quite worthy of crossing Hammet.
And the paintings of the sort of cut-off heads that the sadist decorated with his nest, the pendant James Elroy, the "The Black Orchid" and the better, that is, the declarative tosssed, the neonard's representative.
The City of Sin II is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller's radical -- Rodrigues before the comical tradition.
This must have been largely due to technology 3D.
When you look at the second "House of Sins", you feel like a prisoner in a glass balloon, where the snow drops the toy bed.
Most of the time, it's not snow, it's blood glaze, but in large measure, what difference does it make?
It's about the social and nothing to talk about.
It's only possible when somewhere in the world, we sometimes have, let's say, on the side of a dirty swamp, but there's a normal world where you can bring back a girl who's on a curved road or let's tell the happy parents that her destroyer is punished.
And when there is no place for sin in the city except for sin, then sin is no more sinful than a normal state.
It's boring, like any normal.
The chaos of the City of Sin II is boring.
Justice for the sake of a domestic rolling gave this freshwater sin a small but small glove.
Tips warn: The film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to maturity, in the most vegetarian episode of which a man’s fingers are broken by his fingers, this gives the hell a humour.

The French socialists are supposed to " shut up and bring France in order," says Frasua Allanda, key ally
Mr. Valle called on the deeply divided left-wing forces to “exercise a warm attitude” towards a socialist President who had not been approved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves the respect of everyone; he deserves our loyalty; he deserves our support.
"It's our duty--to stay with him," he said, calling out applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister believed that his Government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the proposals that had stirred up a conflict, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel McCron, the new Minister of the Economy earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Allland begged his Socialist comrades to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobira, Minister of Justice, put sticks in the wheels, offering to a meeting of dissenting members of Parliament from the Socialist Party, and criticized the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost belief in the future”.
Marin Le Pé, the leader of the most right-wing National Front, deplored the constant internal conflicts among socialists, said that she did not imagine that the new Walle Government would last for more than a few months.
François Allland is a naked king, but the naked and the naked Prince Manuel Vall, forced to gather a new government when the summer had not been held before.
"And the new one won't hold up any autumn or winter," said Mrs. Penh to the reporters.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, said that she was confident that the party could easily win the early elections and would manage.
The ruling party of France was defeated in the March municipal elections, and the most right-wing national front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey of Sunday’s Journal du Dimannche found that 76 per cent of the French believed that the Socialist Party was at risk of breaking into several rival factions until the end of Mr. Olanda’s presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician from the University of Sians Po, warned that the French would quickly lose their patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to feel that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"The City Without Drugs" was left without a claim
The Sverdlov arbitral tribunal dismissed the ruling ruling of the Regional Ministry for State Governance to the Foundation for Cities Without Drugs.
The office intended to recover more than 7 million roubles from the organization as a rental fee for the building in the centre of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear twice in court.
Today, the Sverdlov Court of Arbitration has left without review the executive decision of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the region (MIGIO) to the City Without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders, Mayor Ekaterinburg, Evgeny Roseman).
The regional authorities intended to recover 7.3 million roubles from the organization as rent charges.
It was now known that the plaintiff had not appeared twice in the court, which had led to the decision to refuse the hearing.
The reason for the lack of representation in the management of the MAGSO could not be explained, and the Chief of Legal Affairs, Maxim Titus, did not respond to telephone calls.
The Fund also failed to contact representatives.
We recall that this was a specialty who had served as a fund in the city center on Belinsky Street, 19 without charge since 2011.
That was the decision of ex-contor Alexander Misharini.
In November 2012, the administration of the Sverdlov Ministry of Public Property Management filed a claim with the Sverdlov arbitral tribunal for the removal of the fund from the building.
According to the case, the agency had required the court to grant an unlimited contract of free use to the person-in-law.
According to the MAGSO management, the agreement did not record substantial terms of reference for the rental of cultural heritage sites.
The Supreme Court of Arbitration dismissed the claim and appeal was filed at the 17th Court of Arbitration in Permi, which was granted.
The fund then appealed to the same court against the decision, which remained unsatisfyed, after which the decision was appealed by the Fund to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court took sides in the decision.
A new lease was entered into in 2013 and the fund began to pay rent again, which was told by the head of the city of Evgeny Roseman.
The rent was set at 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous administration in the field handed over this grant building to us, recognizing our counter-narcotics merit, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration decided differently," he stated.
Tatian Drogaev, Ekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Ekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, the secretary of the Gordura of Ekaterinburg, Sirs Alexander Kosinz, offered the mayor of the city of the Speaker Eugion Roizmana to resign.
A criminal case involving a person arrested on suspicion of murder was filed with the Retired Deputy of Olga Kiiná, a member of the Mayor ' s staff, who was considered as an associate of the mayor.
How Eugiony Royzman was found a criminal case
On 1 July, it became known that a criminal case had been initiated on the basis of the fact of “celeves” (art. 128.1 of the Criminal Code) on the blog of Mayor Ekaterinburg, Eugion Roseman.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, where a statement was made by the author of the "Protection" Legal Center, Anna Filathov.
According to her, Mr. Royzman accused her of having been involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her ex-wife on her blog post.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that this is the next attempt to avenge the truth.
The iPhone will be turned into a basket.
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple has to present his new developments, there are new releases of what can be expected from the presentation.
According to sources, the sixth generation of the iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet as a result of the joint Apple project and the Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Re/code Internet resource, the presentation of new products on 9 September Apple could, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, allowing a mobile wallet to be available in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The company itself refuses to comment on the matter.
This function allows payments to be made in the store's cash register by means of a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be performed by the user with the help of the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be built for the first time in the NFC technology, which allows for the payment of a fixed-term smartphone and an appropriate reading device on the cash register.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Simiconductors).
The first function of NFCs was presented in 2004 as part of the cooperation of companies Sony, Nokia, Philips Simiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that had entered the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote this technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first footnote on the Android with the NFC-Samsung Nexus S function was submitted in 2010.
In May 2011, Google presented Google Wallet to allow users to link bank cards to their Google account and to pay off with an Android smartphone.
On the other hand, United States experts stress that, despite the large investment by high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, U.S. Ryrilers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their shops in such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple ' s entry into the market will lead to an accelerated and more intensive introduction of the technology at its trading points.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France: Paris' position on the supply to the Russian Federation Mitralas is not changing
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs official, Romén Nadal, declared the consistent position of Paris regarding the delivery by Russia of the Mistral-type helicopter.
“I may recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (Franza Olanda) in his interview with Le Munde of 20 August: “Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent the delivery of them.
This is a decision of the Europeans, not France,” quotes Mr. Nadala as “the RA of Novosta”.
So the representative of the French foreign policy department responded to the question as to whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the Paris position to implement the contract

Mr. Lishenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had departed from Luhanska airport towards the town of Giorgikovka.
For more details on the situation in eastern Ukraine, read Axe Avakov, the first Ukrainian military to leave the Ilowaysk area.
The North Cruise is approaching $3 billion with Prestige Cruises
The North Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.O, the world's third largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiations on the acquisition of a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would have provided Norway Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to cruise ships of the class "lux" and to secured Prestige Cruises because it competes with larger rivals of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Caribbean Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, sourced on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestig Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of the Norgeian Cruise shares.
The sources requested that they remain anonymous because the negotiations are not open.
The representatives of the North Cruise and Prestigue Cruises did not respond to a request for comments, whereas the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Nrwegian Cruise, based in Miami, manages 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Her income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent higher than it was in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the Oseania and Regent brands, which together have eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She claimed $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than one year earlier.
It is expected that the 29 billion cruise industry will benefit in subsequent years from middle-class growth in developing economies, such as China and India.
In front companies are trying to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulatory agencies for primary public participation in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after $850 million in 2007.
The Nrwegian Cruise was created as it is now, in 2000, as a result of a merger with a cruise operator belonging to the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norway in 2008.
Norway Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Hunting owned a 28 per cent share, Apollo owned a 20 per cent share, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP owned a 8 per cent share in the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norway Cruise together make up 82 per cent of the North American cruise stream, according to registration documents at the first public stock of Prestige Cruises.
Kram can receive 250 million roubles of subsidies
In Minsk, Russia offers 250 million roubles to the government television station Cram in 2014.
It is clear from the draft decision of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is posted on a single legislation disclosure portal, that the grant is intended to “cost the cost of creating conditions for the wide-ranging information of the socio-economic situation and the development of the current information space in the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also go to purchase equipment, repair roofs and power systems in a television broadcasting building based in 1959, reports RA News.
The Chinese representative ' s statement on the following day after the decision on the elections has been withdrawn by the Hong Kong democratic movement
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood in the vicinity, waving a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress of China on Sunday decided on a procedure in which only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the election of the head of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of the majority of the members of the nomination committee, who are likely to be captured by Pekin Lavalists.
The decision made it almost impossible for a democratic opposition to enter the ballot paper and forced the democratic activists to resume their promise of stopping Hong Kong's financial centre with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of China's control of Hong Kong, in June, the democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city's business centre and settled a strike.
The briefing by Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Bureau of Relations in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, Jeang Hornschung, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Bureau of the Feng Wei State Council were also to take part in a series of briefings during the day.
The activists stated that they would gather at the head of the Government of Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain has not mentioned democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 hectares of Palestinian autonomy land
The Israeli authorities announced their intention to join 400 hectares of land in the West Bank of the Jordan River, which belongs to Palestinian autonomy.
According to BBC, the decision to join South Bethlehem was linked to the desire to repay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
On Sunday, Israel's Minister of Defence announced the occupation of the territory and mandated the military to establish an administration in the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, the world public should call Israel to account for “the continued settlement activity in the West Bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin demands that Kiev begin negotiations on the “States” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government cease fighting the separatists in the east and immediately begin negotiations on the “States” of the separation region.
His Spokesperson, Demetrius Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean that the eastern part of the territory under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reviewed to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin ' s call for the Kenyan Government to begin negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equal to the obvious strategy to be followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help separatists to take the territory and to force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossi effective independence in order to get closer to Russia than to the West.
In an interview with the First Television Channel, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to return the territory held by separatists in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which was seized in March and April after Moscow had annexeded the Ukrainian Kram peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently named the captured territories of Novorossi, or New Russia, the name of which is referred to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace negotiations would take place in the near future when Ukrainian politicians began campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces attacked peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, the “silver of illusions” reported by ISAR-TASS.
“We must start meaningful negotiations immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, to safeguard the interests of the people living there”, he said.
Peskov said Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of the broader autonomy that had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in the Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the Eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This isn't a question for a discussion between Ukraine and Russia, he said to Peskov, "because it's not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of Spokesperson Kremlin in correcting the “unreasonable interpretation” of Putin's words underlined the decision of the Russian leadership to act against the separatist rebellion in the east other than the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the two million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much greater battle in order to join even the Donetsk and Lugan region of eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million inhabitants were not Russian, and interviews before the outbreak of the conflict had demonstrated widespread support for the desire to remain within Ukraine.
Autonomy, which Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums, would give regional Governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and foreign policy, in fact, giving the Kremlin effective control over the territory that will link the basic territory of Russia with the Crimea.
The main Russian military fleet is located on the Black Sea peninsula, joined five months ago, as well as on commercial maritime institutions and historical marine resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and leaf factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Peter Porosenko proposed, during his teaching speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, weigh the amendments to the Constitution, allowing greater control of their finances and language status to be given to separate regions.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement are accused of Moscow.
Putin's final call to Kiev to agree with separatist leaders as equal followed the rebel attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from an earlier peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-supported separatists have taken control of the town of Novoazsk on the offensive of which Ukrainian security officers say that they fear it is the beginning of a strategic coastal takeover campaign down to Crimea.
This has resulted in extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupoli, a steel port with 500,000 residents, between the Novoovosov and the narrow passage to the Crimea Peninsula.
On Saturday a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels called for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of nevirity," warned Prosco.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for the drafting of more severe sanctions against Russia to be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowisk after two columns of Russian armoured personnel and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support separatists who had difficulty, Colonel Andriy Lissanko, the press secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, informed the reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reported to be held in Ilowiska as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian aircraft captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lilasenko reported on Sunday.
A scandal photo captures Australian famouss and Gabi Greco
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his aversion to hackers, who may have stolen the pictures of his bride - in - law Gabi Greco and the complete list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was outraged after a number of frank photographs depicting Jennifer Lawrence, who was exposed to the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with famous people.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have some 60 live photos of the Great Games star Lawrence and the superstar, including the models of Kate Apton and Kara Delevin, Ryan Grande, Arian Grande and Lia Michel and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strakhowski, and who live in Melbourne Greko also allegedly stole photographs from the iCloud leak.
List 101 is the name of the famous.
Edelstein, who made Greco last month, said Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs should remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York City, is reported to have told the news website that the hacking was “serious” and that those who were directed to it“ feel they've invaded”.
It is assumed that the hacker has 30 photos of Palmer with a former boyfriend, Scott Sidman, including two of the men, where she is in a breast-tight pool.
Palmer works in movies include “Love and Honor” along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the Fearhski movie and actress from Browning's Prohibited Reception yesterday didn't comment on stolen photos.
The representative of Lawrence said, "TMZ, this is an invasion of privacy."
Akter Sett Rogen expressed his disapproval of the hacker, wrote on Twitter: "The removal of photos stolen from the mobile phone is in fact no different from the sale of stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photographs should not be tolerated.
Potential means of stealing photos of naked celebrities are identified
The massive haze of star accounts may have been made because of the vulnerability of the Find My Phone.
A potential scenario of events described the resource The Next Web.
A Python script was published on the Gitub resource to select passwords for the Apple My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the iPhone location.
Apple ID's logic and password are the same for accessing Apple iCloud, from which the photographs of the celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed a way to learn the password from Find My Phone.
Every possible combination of symbols is consistently introduced, starting with the most frequent passwords used.
The author claimed that in the Find My Phone service the number of passwords entered was unlimited.
If the security system is correctly organized, after several failures, the account must be blocked and the user informed of the attempted hacking attempt.
Owing to vulnerability, users have not received any reports of an attempt to obtain a password for their account.
The hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to Hackapp user on Twitter, the vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and a password selection script was written.
Vulnerability is now closed: after five attempts, access to services is blocked.
The resource had been contacted by the Hackapp user, and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was common to many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability had been used to access the “cruise” accounts.
It's not me, plz RT.
On the Prime Minister's Twitter, foreign records appeared again
While there is no solid evidence that vulnerability was used to steal photographs in the Find My Phone, there was already a wave of harmful actions using the service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
Apple then told the media that in this case the safety of the clouds had not been compromised but had not been investigated about how the users had lost their accounts.
The Russian Federation also had previously been hit by Twitter from the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Domitria Medvedev.
If the abusers had access to the iCloude described above, the password to the head of government account in the microblogging service could be stored there.
The Next Web resource could not obtain Apple comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin provided Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-constitution
President Vladimir Putin of Russia gave Russian citizenship to the well - known Ukrainian athlete Anne Burak.
The ordinance is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia for a permanent residence and asked the Federation of the modern five congregations to provide her with the opportunity to speak in favour of the collected Russian Federation.
In 2013, it won the two phases of the World Cup, won a silver medal of the European championship in personal development, and became a champion of peace in a mixed estaphate, which is one of the new types of sport.
It maintains leadership positions in the current season.
According to the rules, to address the Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, it will have to obtain a special authorization from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee.

CCR terminated its investigation into the Toe 204 disaster in Vnonovo
The Russian Investigative Committee (RCC) has ceased criminal proceedings for the accident of a Toe-204 Reed Wings aircraft.
This is reported by the agency's press service.
The decision was taken in response to the death of an aircraft commander and an engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the impact of the accident increased the speed of landing, the failure of the crew to comply with the standard landing procedures, and the unintentional failure of engines to move directly.
A Toy 204 Red Wings aircraft flying from Prague Moscow collapsed on 29 December 2012 while landing at Vnokov Moscow airport.
The airship set out for the runway and set fire.
An aircraft commander, a second pilot and an engineer were killed at the scene.
Two travelers were taken to health facilities, where they subsequently died of injuries.
Three other road forwarders, hospitalized with serious bodily injuries, received long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the car was seriously injured during the time of the crash on the Kiev highway.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The Transport Public Prosecutor ' s Office had conducted a follow-up inspection at Red Wings, in which numerous violations had been identified.
The airline licence was suspended in February 2013.
The company resumed its work in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emmelianenko started training at SIPO
The well-known Russian fighter of mixed style, Alexander Emmelianenko, 33-year-old, who is in SIPO on charges of sexual assault against a domestic worker, has fully recovered from injuries and has started training.
It's something called the Cup.
In May of this year, the Commission of Inquiry of Russia charged Alexander Emellanenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted and detained in Tambowe on 9 May following his accident, which resulted in a broken thigh.
Emmelianenko, Jr., was placed in custody until 31 August, and a sentence was imposed on 1 September.
However, the court was transferred and the investigation continued to extend the period of detention until 30 September.
In the event that it is proven that he is guilty of an athlete, he will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to six years.
What power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" recalls the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emilianenko's career
His last love, Emilianenko, lost in January this year a technical knockout for his countryman Demetria Sosnowsky.
Alexander is a younger brother of a well - known fighter named Fedor Emelianenko.
The latter is a four-fold champion of peace in mixed combat arts, the four-fold championship of the world and the seven-fold championship of Russia on the military samba.
The anger has proved to be the most universal and functional human emotion.
The expression of a person is biologically universal for humankind, and each organ and group of muscles involved in its creation is not an accident but an additional means of expressing power and threats, and scientists in Australia and the United States have identified it.
They reported their findings in the Journal of Evolution and Human Behavior and can be read briefly in a press release from the University of California at Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face -- half-dryed and low-down eyebrows, lined up in the thin line of the lips, crushed nosdrites -- is the same in all cultures, and makes it even blind from birth children who have never seen him, notes the lead author of the study, Aaron Sal.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion had emerged to deal effectively with disputes during the conflict.
The more physical harm one person can cause to another, the more he has the ability to dictate, the more he adds to the neighbor by anger.
Researchers have found evidence of other hypotheses: physically powerful people are more likely to become angry and improvised, feel they are entitled to impose conditions on others that are not acceptable to them, as well as prefer the power to resolve conflicts peacefully.
In the light of the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of the bid”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that make a angry expression of the face must represent an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor, thus making it as soon as possible to accept its terms in order to avoid conflict.
In order to verify this hypothesis, researchers modeled on the computer the person where each of the seven elements of the angry person was present or missing and showed them to the informers.
Although the missing eyebrows or the stand-by stand-by stand-bys did not individually make the person angry, the more powerful physical participants in the study acknowledged the person’s character.
Like animals, man's wrath is a threat: an exaggerated expression of his own strength, forcing him to accept and obey.
A man fanciers his nose and his lips for the same purpose as a lamb that hangs up or a baboon that shows his tacks.
"The "drying" by refusing to accept the situation and the person immediately takes the form that would effectively express the consequences of the refusal on the other side.
But the most amazing thing is that none of the components of a angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," said anthropologist John Tubi.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested that 250 million roubles be allocated to Crim.
The Ministry offered to provide 250 million roubles from the federal budget in 2014 to the autonomous non-profit organization Teladiota Krem.
This is referred to in a draft government regulation prepared by an agency known as Lenta.ru.
According to the explanatory note to the draft, the federal budget grants will be directed “to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information about the socio-economic situation and the development of the current information space in the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.

The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fibre-optic communications line (WLS) and for the maintenance of the energy system.
Grants will be provided within the federal budget provided for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
