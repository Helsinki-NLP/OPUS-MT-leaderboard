At Kherson, people were back at the rally, the Russians didn't make it.
As reported by the Westerners, the Khersons were able to hold a rally before the military routs and equipment arrived at the site.
"We had to hold a meeting, and the technique of the rf had arrived in there," said one of the Westerners.
In the past, the mystics used to gather at protests in the area of Liberty -- near the ODA building and the field.
This area, like the building, is now being controlled by the armed Russian forces, using weapons against rallyers and kidnapping people.

According to Ucreform, residents regularly wage peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.

Sasha was not in school today, so I wrote to the teachers.
Hi, I'm sick, so I'd rather move our meeting to the next weekend, sorry.
I'm good at cooking, and I want the recipe, but I like to have a drink.
In Ukraine, it's traditional to fly around, you know, vortices, you know, other people.
I don't have favorite foods, and I like to try different dishes from different countries.
What are your tastes of food?
I want to be busy.
There's no train, there's no seats.
Sorry, we're a little late.

If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Greenish: Mariopol – the heart of war, stop fighting – we'll have weak positions.
President Vladimir of Greens believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariuples will determine the course of the war – and if the USA is defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and reoccupy occupied territories.
I mean, it's Marivoli, you know, the heart of this war is today.
It fights; we fight, we fight strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They are the people who have attracted a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the EPA, and if they're stronger, the winning table will be more immediate for us and we'll have the advantage of having a dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we may not expect to meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to even return to the cities that we've occupied right now.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in victory will be weaker and perhaps not even interested in the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we do.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory ...."
The Greek also said it's difficult to go to negotiations after the Ukrainians' torture, but "we should not lose the opportunity for diplomatic solutions if we have them."
And it says, "People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something – and I don't think they'll be satisfied with any kind of peace.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end with millions of victims.
And even where there are millions of victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else, no people."

Because of the changing estasis of Ukrainian literature, new ideas were needed to describe its new quality status.
It's just an analysis of the metaphoric space of Ukrainian literature, a study of the state.

Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of animal abuse by civilians to the north of Kiev.
The pictures of the tortured and shot people have confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?
I'm not surprised at anything, but what happens is that I'm sad and waitin' for...
I took the children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-coughed with the kids, and only then did they return to the capital to work.
Since 2014, the SSA has consistently helped, and it has not been doubted for a moment that my family will not be spared in the event of an occupation of the suburbs of Kiev.
Because I was, and I am, absolutely certain that the essence of the rotting Communist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror it simply can't exist, it's built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great - grandfathers was shot down in a prison in Gitomir.
A few years ago in the Jewish SS, a copy was taken from an infuriated case of great - grandfather: the whole matter is over a hundred pages, and the sentence of execution is very simple and even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate, denied the guilt.
The ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was from free people, a poor "one-two" noble, never walked in cogs.
The fact that they lived on furrows and had several cows was sufficient to condemn the peacock and the feeding of young children to death.
The parents didn't even know where to bury them.
Grandma told me that nearly a hundred people had been taken from the village and that they had killed everyone but two who had agreed to give false testimony.
There's a name for Shari's knock in the case.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I'm not surprised if his relative was a KGBista informant.
The apple is falling, as is known, from a nearby apple....
The sharp three, which had led to the execution of the peasants, were ethnic Russians.
In reviewing the case, the great - grandfather showed interest in a variety of information resources.
There's a rose that's really beautiful (without letharm) information resources, like the "The Death Bar," which reminds us of the events of those years.
So in modern times, the descendants of the CNDDs have found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 or 80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of victims of the Berne Repression and publicly wrote the names of murderers, the system was first discredited and then destroyed.
They found children's pornography files on the computer, and they were put in jail for it, and it died very soon.
The KGBists are now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about crimes of the past century.
Why, then, are you surprised by their actions now?
It concentrates on the most indecent features of human nature.
The surface of the thousand-year Ordinian tradition was the reign of slavery and imperial chauvinism in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then what came out was a wild genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligence in a few waves of red terror.
Look at the 1992 Half-French "Checist" film, that's what happened.
Zo you saw my photos in the dome.

The full supply will not be completed until 2027.

I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, my darling, how are you?

How do you feel today?
Hi, sorry, I just woke up, I didn't sleep well.
Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that Kolya and I had begun to make a bad test yesterday.
I'm going to ask if Gregory Denisenka or Jonashek) could do anything to help me with mathematical ideas.
Maybe I can be something of value to them too?
If it's possible, I'd like to bring in mathematical terms for the weekend.
The geometry is really complicated, but we have to work with Kolya in such a way that there is no error.
Thank you for your test assignments.
We also look forward to it.
So she's very happy with any gift she's given.
I'd like to connect the Internet to my Czech number
Last night at the stop of 402 buses, I met a Ukrainian named Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay outside.
Now we agreed that we would be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine who felt my love for each other.

So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago at the Holocaust Memorial Center "Babin Jar" in Kiev, we honored 80 years of German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Jar.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of State, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial unity, peaceful and secure Europe.
That's the basis that we have to protect is also part of our responsibility with regard to our history."
If "the wicked demons of the past appear today in the new garment," he said,“ then for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never more!
The fight has to last."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the inhabitants of its blocked cities, and let them die of disease.
Russian troops have carried out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually, like shootings in Babin’s Jairus.
For over a month, the Germans see it in real-time news.
Yes, Germany is implementing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons that have not been imagined so long ago.
Germany is diverting the heavy arms required by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to take a stand against the swastika.
That means fighting all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to conquer evil and to stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
One for you at night.
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write down when to be assembled.
It was not Lydia who was the only sick person who was not sick with a new type of blanket.
Then I'll do it tomorrow.

Sergey Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67 per cent of Ukrainians were opposed to join NATO and only 18 per cent of the respondents were pros.
After the Hypocist Revolution, the escapes of Victor Yanukovich, the annexation of Crimea, and the beginning of the Donbasy War, NATO’s opponents began to fall and its supporters to rise.
Since the beginning of the full-scale war against Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – over 75 percent.
Despite Ukraine's support for NATO's entry into NATO and for NATO's military assistance, there are now many criticisms about the Alliance and member countries – the timely supply of arms, the refusal to close the sky, the reluctance to “serve” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its desire to join the Alliance through the position of the Russian Federation if it can stop the war and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military guarantees.
In the new episode of the "Clean Questions", together with the editor of European Truth, we are talking about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the invasion of Russia, where NATO should be criticized, and why the Alliance is being criticized in vain, why our NATO membership prospects are closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in victory with Russia can become a second Budapest memorandum.
How do you think it's here?
My partner's volt is marked by my application for consideration.
I gave it to you through this mobile app.
We don't have visas, we have to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was framed in Poland, and no visas were given, and we gave it to the dog.
We'll make sure you write it!
You know, Denise's in a good mood today.
I made an agreement with a Ukrainian boy I met yesterday to meet at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
Because I don't like it, I don't have enough for long.

I'm leaving my kids for three or four years and I'm going home because I can't leave them anymore.
You'll be back at 6-7 in the morning.
Yes, a sick heart.
I had a deep feeling for him, but he did not do so well, and I left him.
After a while, he returned and apologized.
I refused him.
Then, after some time, he telephoned that he had had an operation on his heart.
I asked him to just talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I gave him psychological support for almost half a year.
During that time, we talked a lot.
I had problems at work in parallel at that time.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, you know, maybe we need to look at it differently.
And he offered me to get married, and two days later he died.
As a result, God has determined our destiny.
What does being ready for marriage mean?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a place to live, and I'm very glad to have a place to live and have a place to be with a baby.

God is never too late, for all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:)
I understand very well the price of unskilled work, and I realize that a job like I had at home in Kiev, I can't have the money I made at home, and I'm not going to get it right now.
But just sit down and I can't do anything, because then all the bad thoughts in the head go wrong, so you have to do something physically.
Papers are issued at the airport from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and at other times you can wait.

So we took them home.
We slept with Vic in the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.

And I forgot to tell you that tomorrow's the meal.
One mother said it was time for the kids to get the nuns with the jam.
He's coming to visit you.
Please, do you have an approximate schedule of cleaning an apartment a month ahead, even though for an approximate understanding of what day?
I don't remember any of this schedule.
The Russian army is threatening to hit Kiev with a rocket. They say they haven't done it before.
The direct language of Konachenkov is, "We're seeing attempts by the Ukrainian troops to destroy objects in the Russian FK.
If such incidents occur, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike the decision-making centres, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously held.”
The Russians attacked Kiev in the early days of full-scale invasion of the Russian occupying forces into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that hit the Ukrainian PPO system fell into an apartment building in the capital cities.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a multi-story site at the Valery Lobanowski Avenue.
On March 1, Russians hit a television station near Babin Jar, killing 5 passersby.
On March 2, Russian PCP systems were shot down over the South Railway Station by Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building.
March 14 — The wreckage of the attacker’s missile destroyed the building and the Trolleybus on Courennic in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a Vynogrard range, killing one person, wounding another 19 people, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed modern TRC Retrovelle on the Winograda, killing at least four people.
The mayor of Kieva Vitalii Kličko stated again on April 13 that the residents of the capital, who had been living in the city until it was too early to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians were still able to launch missile strikes on Kiev, and there were many mines and unexploded ordnances in the capital.
The main intelligence agency of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians were planning a series of terrorist attacks in the Russian Federation to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters exploded near Beelgord in Russia.
In early April, the Beelgorda local authorities claimed that a “Ukrainen projectile” had fallen near the city.
Obviously, the elites in Washington, D.C., throw in a cold sweat at the very thought that the Nazi fighters would kill the Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Greenski does not talk to them as much as they do to their voters and their societies in general.
By speaking in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds on the squares of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors were inaccessible.
He does not persuade European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, and he will convince the European nations that elect those politicians.
And these talks, this sophisticated alloy of power, of touching and of times of despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
As long as the same Bayden is categorically opposed to the closure of the sky, 70 percent of its citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels against Ukraine’s speedy introduction, the process is already under way.
I understand, so I don't want to be seen as a fraud.

These are tractors that are actually going to go to the field under gunfire because it's time to sow.
They are bus drivers who are willing to travel to the rubber stations today to temporarily occupied areas to take help there and to collect people from there.
They are heroic leaders who travel undauntedly into the war zone, calm down and help refugees in the cars, and at peaceful stations they help the volunteers load a humanist in the cars.
They were the motorists who stood on the Jatomir Road during the early days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous people.
These are commissaries, which carry garbage under gunfire, repair pipelines and power lines to ensure that people are provided with the necessities of life.
They are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, no matter how bad they complain, and at a free moment they will volunteer to pick up their pharmacies on the front.

The Ukrainian overseas electoral district (UZZ) is an electoral district that unites the electoral areas outside Ukrainian territory and consists of voting facilities in Ukrainian embassies and consulates and military bases abroad, where Ukrainian peace-keeping contingents (Koso and Democratic Congo) are located.[1] The role of the District Electoral Commission for the Foreign Electoral Region is carried out by the Central Electoral Commission.
Only state votes are held in the foreign electoral district: elections of the President and of the People's Deputies, and all Ukrainian referendums.

President Andrey Hermack's Office reported that Russia is launching a "feeling operation" with respect to the weapons that allied forces hand over to us.
The direct language of Hermak is, "They understand that they're losing the war, seeing their backwardness, and they want to kill the supply of arms in any way.
For example, one of the last feces is the destruction of Slovak-transmitted CZK-300.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
We know what the Russians are going to do, and I'm going to call one of them.
They may run fairies that Ukrainian soldiers appear to be armed with allies, and they are heavily armed with the Russian army.
I want to warn the fairies right away.
For the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the MSS solely send the enemy into the world.

The international community continues to express shock and indignation after evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine and Moscow has rejected these reports as “provoking”.
“A report on the murder, rape and serious injury of Ukrainian civilians by the Russian forces is worth condemnation,” said the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jasinda Ardern, to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“The Russian must answer to the world for what they have done”, she added, adding that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its struggle against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister, Fumio Kisida, called the incidents “a violation of international law”.
The statements were made after reports of hundreds of civilians being shot and thrown into fraternal graves or abandoned on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Buchi by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for a few weeks.
Photos that allegedly depicted the bodies of civilians executed with tied hands shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal persecution of the guilty.
The President of France, Emmanuel McCron, stated in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian forces had committed “war crimes” in Buchi.
“What happened in Buchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear action,” said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian exports of coal and oil.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, declared that the Russian forces could go so far as to make a “genocide” in Buchi.
“We will make sure that those who commit these war crimes do not go unpunished, ” said Sanchez in Madrid.
In a public television program late on April 3, Maria Zaharov, a Russian spokesman, rejected the charges as “provoking”.
She said without proof that the United States and NATO had “promised” images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me, the fact that these statements were made in the first minute after these material came into existence is not a matter of doubt to the person who "promotes" this story," said Zaharova.
In the past, Russia's Minoborians also claimed without proof that the pictures of Bouchi were “a further manifestation of the Kenyan regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called the “provoking of Ukrainian radicals” in Buchi.
On April 4, the Russian Following Committee issued a statement in which it announced a “investigation” on charges of the dissemination by Ukraine of “a known false information” about the actions of the Russian forces in Buchi.
President Vladimir Greensky of Ukraine came on April 3, accusing the Russian forces of a "genocide" in a city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they were supposed to come to Butchi to see what their troops had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out, ” said the Greens in the video, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a joint responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures, for shooting in the back,” he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for military action in Ukraine.
"When we find people tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a correspondent in the Ukrainian service, Radio Freedom, saw a civilian body on the streets of a small city.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AAP journalists have seen at least 21 people's bodies in different places in Buchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people -- all in a civilian -- were scattered on the ground near a place that the locals said used Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed at close range.
The Ukrainian authorities generally claimed that the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in the Kiev area, which until last week had been controlled by Russian forces.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything in the list.
They said, "Kiev isn't." Like the pollinators took the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
This list includes another item about which much less information is currently available – the removal of the local population to enemy territory.
About the middle of March, the Russian eyecuffs were "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements into their territory and the area of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually handed over to the Russian military polygon.
Ukrainian truth has found Ukrainians and their relatives to find out how the evacuation is happening and whether there are ways to go back to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text are subjected to voluntary evacuations outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and indispensability.
Fortunately, they're alive and they're in contact with their families.
However, in view of the claims made by the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict compulsion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the second maternity home, took the children out without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of a dead Ukrainian champion from Joseph Zachzepinski's voyage.
Alexander's family, Marini and their 10-year-old daughter, Vala, moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at Antonov Airport, about 20 miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in a military town even though it was a civilian.
As true plastics, Denise and Marina had to pack their anxious suitcases in advance, but on February 24th, they didn't have time to evacuate.
There was no car in them, and no bus was taken.
About 12:00 a.m. on February 24th, they saw helicopters with Latin V followed by the first shells.
One of them hit another house.
And then the family went down into the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17th, before the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
They did not all decide.
"On the 6th evening of February 24th, people came to the driveway, and people who didn't speak Russian, and they didn't speak Ukrainian.
They say, "Is there a person?" I say so.
They searched me, asked me if there were weapons in the basement.
All the men were questioned whether they had served in the army.
The women said, "We have come to protect you under the direction of Ramzan Kadrov."
It was a Bohemian MON, not even a military force, young boys 25-35 years old.
They said, "We got help from the Ukrainians in the war, Sashko Billy, commanding the Nationalist Movement of Una-UNSS "Wicking," which was fighting on the side of the monks in the first Russian-Central War -- the UP -- now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we were missing.
We say that the water was a big problem.
They broke up the store, they took the goods out of there, they took the Russians away, and they brought us six detours.
There's also an online video where kids thank Kadirov for eating.
So they bring the cowboys after the robbery, and they say, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmadovic."
No one wanted to talk in particular, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid says, "You have seven days to give away our phones" -- they laughed.
They were also constantly isolating themselves from the Russians.
They said, well, they did, because they didn't want it, the Ukrainians support it, and they're kind of like, "Putin is a bastard, Caddy, too, but we can't do anything, because there's our families."
And mostly, they didn't fight, but they went out and looted the shops, looted them.
The hens were carried to themselves, one was tied to one leg of the geostationary tape, and the other was his white animal, called her "fun."
They had come to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence was working... when they were beaten in Buchi, so they didn't even take the dead, they said, "Well, you have artillery?"
Moreover, in the early days, we had a group of fencing squads — vaccuns among themselves — asking for passwords to detect whether they were strangers or not.
They were there before March 13th, followed by the Russian ONN, followed by the Oms dean.
They put 30 to 40 units of technology between houses – ours was constantly hit by them from the Birakars.
But these came and told us that the VMS was gone, but there was the Azov, and they said there were so thousand 100 in Ukraine.
"Ki has given up" has been on its way since early March.
On one occasion, a Russian officer, or a FSB representative, came to us and said there was going to be a evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- about Bush, Gostmel, we thought maybe we had a green corridor.
From the very beginning, we passed our lists on to the monks, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus and then maybe to the Growths."
We say we don't want to go or go.
They said, "Crush your children's mental health!"
How it worked, they took us into the basement, and they started shooting us from under the house -- or the Gardas, or the mortars.
And then it came back-- the neighborly houses were just burned up, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit in the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the bordermen and the Red Cross.
The part didn't go, saying it was for traitors in their homeland -- it said, "you're going to be shot, you're going to be sold to the organs."
We were taken across Chernobyl, on both sides of the road were burned, broken up by technology, even though the white blood cells were telling us that the Russian machinery was being taken immediately.
There's a lot of capionaries, buried equipment, and soldiers.
We went through improvised control at the Comar Whiteroom, and a lot of people were without documents, because they were burned.
We were put in the tents of the Red Cross and given tea.
And here we hear shots firing a rocket, and we can see -- it's lskandar working on Kiev.
Even though these Belarusian Red Cross guys said, "No, these planes fly, they turn around on the border."
But we're airlines, we've got education, we know what this is.
Then we were loaded onto the bus and taken to the Chemmel sanatorium near Gomel.
His supervisor, Wenger Vasil Stepnović, said, "Here, I'm hooli, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukas will not stop until these thieves get their hands on them.
Poor people are suffering!
We've got Lukashenko so good!
He will say, "This is what he will say."
There's been an interview with the Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium said to us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least so called) spread disinformation that men in Poland were not allowed to travel.
Many believed it and feared leaving Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents — our daughter had no passport.
We had him on Monday, and Thursday began a war.
The Ukrainian Consulate didn't help us, and in Minsk, they told us that without passports, no one's on the bus.
Here, let me tell you what the Belarusian volunteers did to us.
We were housed in Minsk, and the escort was made.
In the sanatorium, they didn't keep it strong.
Our second group migration representative said you could live here for a maximum of one week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there's no payoff here.
We found an internal transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled about 30 miles [50 km] from the Ukrainian border, we saw ballistic missiles fired at Ukraine: the rocket first flies out, it shines beautifully, and then goes out.
The people who boarded the bus in Mozilla said that the Russians were shooting the polytones all the time.
But I can say that the white blood cells absolutely don't want to fight.
The generals are fired from the army.
One woman told us that if he was called, she would break something with his son.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, doesn't believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are peaceful people."
They don't realize that their troops are being used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland friends were waiting for us to take us to Estonia.
We're going through registration now, deciding what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, there are now, probably, as many Estonian flags as there are."
Marina lived in a military town in Gostomela with her brother's family -- his wife and two children, 18th and 22nd.
On February 24th, she telephoned her nephews and asked them to collect the most needed items and documents.
At night they went to the basement of a nearby house.
Marina couldn't go home alone and, in principle, can't go back, the house is gone.
No one knew about the evacuation.
On Mondays, you can't be at the center somewhere?
Thank you, we've got everything. We're waiting for you at the house!
Thank you for the arrangement that's very nice.
And in this little apartment, they don't catch Wyphai, mostly all of your questions I'm answering and now I don't know how to be? And kids are doing online on Monday and the internet isn't there.

On April 1, the city’s head, Anatoly Fedocrus, announced a happy message — the Ukrainian military, on March 31, freed the city from Russian invaders.
The following day the occupiers were expelled from all over the province of Kiev.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would experience at that time was overshadowed by terror and hatred, for at the same time it became known that at least 280 civilians had been shot by Russians in the Bush alone.
They were killed right on the street, some were tied up with their hands and shot in the back, some killed with minors.
The old village of Motizin Olga Suchenko, her husband, Igor, and his son Alexander, were killed and followed by torture.
Olga and Alexander's bodies were in the fraternal grave, Igor in the sewer.
A two - mile [20 km] highway from Kiev revealed the bodies of several naked women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, no one will be home.
I ordered a DHL package from Germany.

President Vladimir of Greens stated that some of the weapons provided by Western partners had gone too late.
He said that in an interview with Associated Press, which was published by the Presidential Office, he wrote "European Truth."
"All the equipment they send is too late for some types of equipment.
So when we talk, for example, about Mariuples, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From some country leaders, I can see 100-percent support, which is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said the Greens.
On the question of, it's enough weapons that Ukraine got to make the difference in war, the president said, "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would be no such war, or it would have looked different.
"She would have opened itself another way, we would have a neighbor's shoulder, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be a war," he added.
Remember, the Prime Minister of Great Britain has promised Ukraine new military aid, which includes reservations and anti-ship weapons.

He was a very wealthy man, and after a while he telephoned and informed him that he had had heart surgery.
I asked him to talk to me and support me, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy man, and he thought I might be his toy and I might need his money.
And then he made a suggestion to me.
"There was a car in my yard, like a crocodile, and it would drop the hail.
And they kept me in the house, then they led me to the basement, and there was a lot of people, about 400 people, breathing nothing.
And what about the housing that you took the picture out of the house?
I haven't really got there yet.
The Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science has already simplified this fairy tale.
So the last two videos I'm going to see is when the Internet is going to work.
At work is there a drift or not, can you walk in what you have?
All right, he'll come over there and pick them up.
I'm not greedy for everything.
I understand I can't sit at your place. I need to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or Ukrainian television at all.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a pro-president, propaganda channel, not really interesting to me at all.
What happened at the station with the man that the police came and the ambulance?
Diane didn't answer me and you
All right, I just need to print the kids' pictures, so it'll be good.
But perhaps you need more detailed knowledge of Czech.
I'm worried you're happy with my job.
In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian, but I am studying in Czechia, for the speciality of tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with your kids at peace and with your grandmother.
I want you to be with me, wake up with you.
Grieving in a strange land, you usually feel more inclined to go home every day.
Mrs. Agata, if you want this photo, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make the best of our lives here.

"I'm telling her that TV and radio repair are too busy because of import details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to talk like anything when they call."
"We've been hiding war from our mother-in-law for a month.
So far, it's been successful.
However, in Plyses (kiss — U.S.A.) on the foot and back paws, fur has covered itself — it may be stress, harm, and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are removed, and the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
Unlike their mother - in - law, the mark is not deaf, the sirens hear, and the explosions."
Because Olga doesn't hear well and spend most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her incognito.
And on April 1rd, 93-year-old Oksana Paulov took up arms for the first time in his life.
"33 days I, as a guerrilla, lived with her in the apartment.
War was kept out of it, and I was formally there for several hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver -- she listened for four hours, then she sang two hours."
The radio receiver was always around the bed.
Most of the time, the mother - in - law spends in her room.
That's a bad thing. That allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I hid in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the TV.
And then I called everyone who's talking to her, and that's 6-7 people.
I asked her to talk to me about anything but war.
I'll ask my girlfriend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
It's April 17th, I'm cleaning two apartments:
Good evening, I didn't think about it somehow.
Hey, if tomorrow needs more help, we can come.
If you have to order them to come out of the house for dinner, they're going to have to print out, they're going to be printed out, and I'm going to sign.
I suggest you men, women, children moving out, all interested persons please write in private messages, price:
I understand and don't complain, but in my situation, I'll be looking here.
I'm telling you, the embassy is just here.
The British, who fought in the U.S.S.E. for Mariuples, says they're ready to surrender to the Russians.
The British, who is a military commander of the Ukrainian Marine Armed Forces Marines Brigade, who participates in the defense of Marivopol, told his friends and family that they would store their weapons and surrender to Russian occupationers.
Source: Eislin Auslin's twitter page, a British man who had served in the ISA ranks since 2018, an Air Force reference to the family and friends of Auslin, Atlas News, with a reference to the words of a friend of Alice who spoke to him
It's like, "We've got a message from him, "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariuples, but we don't have a choice but to go into Russian forces.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will soon end."
Eislin was a member of the 36th separate Marine Marine Infantry Brigade of the U.S.S., which is involved in the Mariuspol's defense operation.
Air Force journalists contacted the mother of the military officer Ann Wood, and she confirmed that on the phone her son had reported that they were planning to appear captive.
Another military friend, Brennan Philips, also confirmed to journalists that in his last telephone discussion, Icelin had talked about the plans of their capitulation unit.
He said that the crew had ended in ammunition and food.
Journalists at Atlas News contacted a friend who said that Alexander's unit intended to surrender to the Russian units so that they would not be caught without weapons and bullets at the hands of the so-called "Chador" troops.
Social media were also involved in the distribution of a telephone recording, which Eislin seems to talk to his friend, an American friend, who is planning to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Aislin said that they were trying to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British had told him that he had been threatened by representatives of a private military company called Wagner in Instagram.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark al-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight against the terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the U.S.C.E. and made an oath.
Ezra's friends and close friends were called Johnny, and in social media he's more famous for the ninjasack Gundi.

I am not afraid of robots, as I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's very interesting about your tradition, we go to Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved a law enforcement project of 7,176 called "What About Monitoring of Ukraine's Potential Threats to National Security in the Economy".
It's surprising that, in fact, Ukraine's only potential threat to national security in the economy... the place behind which members of the supervisory council meet.
Lawmakers believe that making decisions by the supervisory council of control in conditional Kiev can somehow solve Ukraine’s national security problems.
We know of a large number of new dangers to the staff, but until we are not aware of any company that needs to meet physically at the location of the supervisory council.
A potential threat from such a law is understood as a great basis for putting on all the gains in the difficult reforms of enterprises following the Hygiene Revolution, including independent supervisory councils, and then establishing manual management.
That's the way it was until 2015.
Why is the council’s supervisory body in charge, and who should be included in it?
And more importantly, if under patriotic slogans one harmful piece of law can take off tomorrow, the others can also go through proZorro's system of government purchases or NSA independence.
Many things can be written for war.
In fact, this initiative came before the beginning of the war and the legal order of 7,176.
Thus, on February 22, this rule was introduced into a comparative table of law, 5397.
In general, the desire to untie the council in one way or another circulates among some of the popular polls long ago.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to demonstrate the possible consequences of the law enforcement work, let us discuss the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then let's make some suggestions on how to solve the issue of ownership of enterprises during the war.
The first deputy secretary of economy, Denise Cudin, explained the need for such an innovation to risk losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make it impossible for remote surveillance teams.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board won't be able to make the necessary decisions about how the company might be paralyzed.
We feel that this is a risk, but can it prevent members from moving to Ukraine to the supervisory council?
Let us imagine a rather cynical situation where independent members of the supervisory council (which make up the majority of the ranks) put their personal safety ahead of the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case, they could be released by law.
And then, most likely, that would lead to the loss of the quorum, the necessary supervisory council to make any decisions.
Instead, it would not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory council, since the law required a competitive selection, which would take an average of three to four months.
Thus, the 7,176 decisions proposed by the law enforcement agency are likely to be unable to prevent the loss of the supervisory council’s decision - making power, but rather, they will!
The People's Deputies, the author of the law, Demetr Natae, provides other reasons for his support.
In particular, he says, "Many enterprises, especially the Defense and Industrial System (OPC), now need editing," and so it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, talk about addresses and other sensational information from the Zoom Vienna."
To begin with, Ukraine has little or no responsibilities at all for the PPCs, which are supervised by the Council.
The visual council is not the Urobannyprom, which is essentially the management of almost all of the SPC's enterprises.
But even in the Uroboronprom, in accordance with legislation, the supervisory council has very limited powers, and all its members have responsibilities that are not free of charge.
All the power in Urobororomy is vested in the Director-General, who by the way makes decisions on the necessity of relocating a company that is part of a concession.
Moreover, such an argument does not stand up to criticism, since there is no legislative change in the legislation governing the activities of the JPCs.
Mr. Detroit, on his Facebook page, also cites arguments that can be classified as "emotional."
Such arguments usually have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of the monitoring and control, but let's try to figure out some of them: "Regardious alien experts in the first word "war," back in 2021, leave Ukraine, but remain members of the board of oversight in Ukrainian state enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand dollars, while Ukraine itself actually suffers war."
First of all, it's a manipulation, most of these board members never lived in Ukraine, and only occasionally came here.
So it's unfair to say they're leaving Ukraine, to put it mildly.
Second, as a result of the coronavicus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian board members have long used online meetings.
This instrument has long been a common tool in world practice, with its many applications — business, education, medicine, and so forth.
And you don't want to forget that membership in the supervisory council isn't a full-time job.
Generally, these people have other jobs, and it's electronic communication that helps them to do so.
Third, all these claims are read as claims solely to foreigners.
Interestingly, why did he not make identical claims for members of the Ukrainian supervisory council?
Because they're also not at the place where they're finding their companies.
In fact, this is not the first gradual attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from the board of oversight, and war is just a convenient opportunity.
Hi, I'm in Ukraine, and I'm looking for alternatives to temporary shelter in the family, with two children.

In the Brovarsk, Vishgorod, and in the Buchang region of the Kiev region, which were released from the occupations, a strong two-hour curfew will be introduced.

It's going to be from April 2 to 6:00, 5 April.
Details: According to the head of the crowd, traffic and foot are strictly prohibited from staying on the streets and in other public places.
Residents can only go outside when alarmed to get cover.
Such restrictions have been imposed in order to eliminate the consequences of Russian aggression by clearing and decontamination.
Omelenuk urged those who had left these areas to hold back from returning home.
In the rest of the Province, the curfew will last from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. daily.

The Lukashenko regime has detained three white cells 27 and 28 years of age, involved in the destruction of the two signal cabinets under Osirovović to ensure the movement of train trains.
Source: Radio Swanda, Vnasa Law Protection Centre, MAF Chief of Criminal Police Gennadia Kazakević, quoted by the Chief Information Society of BelT.
In the MAF, Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three people in Bobrouysk had been detained and one had been injured for their hard support.
According to the Vise, the men were actively opposed and trying to escape at the time of the delay.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and kept in a medical facility.
Others were provided with medical care locally.
President of the Criminal Police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Belarus, Gennadine Kazakević, stated that "Terror attacks on the railways of the Russian Federation will be brought to an end" by the armed forces.
On April 6, it was known that on March 30th, the police detained another white - railway colleague, a Baranovitz staff member, and a BWC administrator at VContactita and Valentine's House of Samsuk.
Where it is currently present, and in which state unknown, @belzd_live reports.
By the end of March, at least 40 railways had been held in Belarus for reconnaissance.
And remember, the BYpol regime announced by the Lukashenka regime to be extremist continues to call for white blood cells to take place before sabotages on railway and Belarus's infrastructures under the "Veamage" plan.
Belarusian Jewish guerrillas are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
We know that through Belarus, the Russian Federation transfers power and technology to war.

U.S. forbids investment in the Russian Federation and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the EU, introduce new sanctions against the daughters of President Putin, the largest banks of the Alpha Bank and Sberbank, and ban all new investments in Russia.
This is mentioned in a report on the White House website.
Sbyerbank is Russia's largest financial institution, which is owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets pertaining to the U.S. financial system and prevent US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will make a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Bayden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision of over 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The private sector's exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, big retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as legal and consulting firms, is a statement by the White House.
The third step in the new U.S. sanctions was the restrictions on large Russian public enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will ban U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and from freezing any of their assets in U.S. jurisdiction.
A detailed list of Minphine will be published the following day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of adult children Putin, the wife and daughter of the Foreign Minister of Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the Russian Vice-President and Prime Minister Demetrius Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Misushist.
Sanctions separate them from the United States financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.

I was lucky enough to find a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So it is our hope that for the first time, someone will come to our home) we may even pay for a room or an apartment, but if it is in our pocket.
Clearness and order are guaranteed.
We don't have harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such help at such an early time.
I had a lecture in English after lunch and went to work in the children’s room.
I was there to explain to Margaret how to fill in all the documents.
I hope she understands it and will do well.
And I also met Mrs. Lena and I talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.
It's free swimming.

We'll do it somehow.
But how it will be paid, please, no loans.
Text me straight, and I'll help.
We're your partner or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.

Something comes from you, I don't see
I'm also very sad.
I'll remind you of the bill later.

Good evening, I can't share with you.
I'd like to read Joe Dispatchs, and he's scientifically researching the effects of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections.
"1+1" Journalist Nataly Nornan released in the morning on April 12th, the video that she was given to the 36th Marines Brigade from Mariwall.
In it the military are said to have no arms left to participate in the fighting and the mountain of the wounded.
They said "account goes by hour."
Before that, on April 11, 36th, a separate crew of Marines, who participates in the defense of Marivópolis, published an address to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last fight for Mariupoli's defenders, and Ukrainian military command didn't have two weeks to do.
The social media said that the declaration had been published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valerius Zalogna, assured that the defence command link in Mariopol was and that the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of a public debate.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian combatants at the Azostal plant's site in Marivoli and to use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian octupants threw a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariuples.
Andrey Biltheski, the RF army has used chemical weapons over the Azzstal plant, which is holding the Azov regiments back.
Thank you, I'm going to adapt to you.
The situation is the same as we're staying here for the time being.
2 hours of driving) going out, Mom shopping, and back!
It doesn't matter.
She forgot what she'd do.
The Czech drones have started flying over Ukraine from now on.
Almost 50 professional copies will serve to detect, and some of them will serve directly to destroy the enemy invader.
Two Zakarpathic brothers and two Czech brothers, “traps”, were sent to Ukraine the previous day through a deputy of the Mukakev Council of Volodymiro Labutenka.
Now their inter-urban friends, led by the village councillor and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101, have delivered the drones for assignment: they have received special units of Ukrainian troops in a number of cities where fighting is now taking place.
In order to make the most efficient and secure use of the copiers, their locations are now kept secret.
The four friends who help the Czech Army to stop on a planned move from Czechia say that the next day, many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine to help destroy a Russian buyer and preserve Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, I love sweet, but I can do it without him.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine, keep working.
All right, if it's okay, I'll take it.
I'll try it myself, but if I get a traffic jam, I'll write it to you if I can?
The Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally at the old age's lady in the village of Yves, she saw me and said I was pregnant but said there was no home.
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll feel better.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm on the street tonight, too.
She's been drinking medicine and tea, feeling worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, give me the music you like.
I'm curious about how much music you've got
Mom and Dad Must Listen
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
It's colder today, it's raining, it's gotta be warm tomorrow.
But it's not a pity for the destroyed houses, it's a pity for the people who're being bullied.
At Kherson, the waitress fell from the "Slave of Ukraine" memorial in Kherson on the streets of Percopaska.
Details: It is said that unknown people have broken off the flag of the European Union, broken down panels with photographs of the sky hundred and killed in Russian-Ukrainen war.
The Ocupupanites' portraits of the heavenly hundred heroes and of the dead members of the Russian-Ukrainen war.
They lifted the flag.
Good morning, thank the kids for the carol, we don't have that habit so we didn't know, we gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to be given.
There's a Czech who can talk to someone if that's what.
Because I'm living in the dormitory till 12 will be people here and then going to work.
Hey, it's a little better now.
Today I've had my cutlery.
Even today, it's already asleep.
So we have made great progress.
I'm sure I'll have to bring the cooks back another time!
I have no power to do them.
Since I'm repulsive from the days and times I have a job cleaning the apartments after the guests, I could say something like the April of the month because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning the apartments.
And on May of the month, I can tell you a little bit about the end of April or early May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry I haven't done a long time preparing dinner and sleeping a little.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or we'll meet again after you come over.
He's modest, he's been learning a lot lately.
It went very well.
I was a bit shocked to be working with people in such a high office.
Today, I have learned from the lady who is the director of the Land Economics Department.
She was very pleased with my work.
A scavenger in a manger was good for himself.
On Monday, I have to ask for confirmation of employment, as well as for cash in yose pay.

If he's going to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if possible.
I've got to get another analysis.
You don't have to go again.
It's very bad working a grain can, and it's not good enough, and we need a master to fix it.
That's enough.
Can You Send me the Right Email Address?
I want to send you an invitation to a Czech course that you have enrolled in.
And they feed their children there, or should they bring them with them?
Now there's one question you can come in for a moment.
If There Is Further Help for Writing
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating the Passover tonight, aren't you?
From the beginning, we didn't really want you to raise money so people wouldn't think we were faking it!
But for online filling, I didn't have enough of two things:
I'm going to go to rest, and I'm going to need some energy and energy, thank you for the present.
I'm going to take a look at this video, and it's going to be good because the whole family will be painting.
The Carazine University urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in the Messing and Social Networks, rumors and gossip.
Use only official information.
You can count on me, thanks!
My other brother, who's staying in Ukraine, is also helping the army.
I've collected a couple of work for the portfolio.
After the holiday, they're supposed to do the Internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I've been treated the day I was out at work is a vacation.
Building a headquarters: Russia is preparing an provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "in aggression against the neighboring state."
It is true that “the conduct of provocative actions by the armed forces of the Russian Federation in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against its neighboring state” is not excluded.
Details: Opposer continues to create a successor group of forces for action in the Slobojian direction.
Perhaps the nearest days will be the next to try to recover the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to make preparations and dispatch a special warehouse, arms and equipment to participate in the fighting in the territory of Ukraine.
Training and military equipment are being carried out at the constant station of the 60th individual firing squad (Monastyrius) of the 5th General Military Army of the Eastern Military Region.
It is likely that the marked arms will be moved into the temporarily occupied Donetsk area.
Also, in order to repair the loss of the special composition of the Battalion tactical unit of the 36th individual Motoc Brigade (Borzea, Zabaykal province), 29 East Military General Army military personnel are recruited from the designated brigade.
A special problem for the enemy is the recruitment of drivers and driving mechanics.
The departure of the selected special warehouse from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Perhaps the enemy, in order to disrupt the delivery of cargo to combat sites, will continue to strike over transport infrastructures in Ukraine with a view to their destruction or decommissioning.
The designated units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the task of increasing the protection of the Ukrainian-Boborian border in the areas of the Bridges and Gomels.
In the Slobojian direction, separate units of the 6th Common Army and the northern fleet's coastal forces continue to partially block the city of Harkov, carrying artillery fire in separate areas of the city.
In the Izum direction, the area is being investigated to identify the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
The enemy applies "Orlan-10" to BPFL.
With the strength of two Battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to make a move in the direction of the people’s Long ways and Domitrek, and did not succeed, and left for previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the main effort continues to focus on the population - controlled areas of Persistence, Rubizny, Lower and Novobahmoth, as well as the establishment of full control over the city of Mariupoli.
The enemy tried to storm the Golden area, and he did not succeed.
In the city of Mariopol, artillery and airlines continue to storm the areas of Azzstopla and the seaport.
The enemy, by the forces of individual units, fired artillery shots at Ukrainian troops in the areas of the town of Visokall, Labour and Marian.
In the Donetskaya and Luhansk area, Ukrainian defences for the past 24 years have been attacked by four enemy attacks, five tanks destroyed, eight armoured units, six motor vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
I don't understand what you're thinking?
I'm sure we'll make it by now, but I'm not sure.
And you can sleep and I'll delay you.
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you don't want to see me tonight, so tell me, I'll understand.
Thank you, we didn't watch TV at home, so we didn't have to set up :)
I'm just going to turn on the TV just to listen to Czech.
I'm running out of a lot of tariffs today.
Can we do this today by telephone?
Buy fabrics for drying, canoes, drying threads
I understand that I can prepare the material in this field.
I'm a little ashamed to ask, she's giving us a lot of pies.
We'll see my father after that. We'll have to see him.
I read an appearance in a Facebook, that maybe Google wrote something in its own way, I think the phone number's enough.
Hello, we've got the things you brought, but there are things you can bring to us in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about work.
If Mr. Director works, I can start at work the next week, because I plan to go to the office tomorrow night to present my papers (if it is, because there are too big queues) and Saturday rains : . . . . . . . . . . . ..
I'm looking for a team in the beginning, I liked chemistry at school, I'm learning Czech to know very well, I want to work on Thevi.
Friends of old, and not really, friends I don't know personally, friends of spirit and mind.
Now you too have faced difficult times.
During the past month, I've been talking to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from your feet to your head, as it has been for every Ukrainian.
A lot of you are running from Russia.
And many of you have confessed that you feel guilty and ashamed of your country's actions toward your neighbors.
Because they give Ukraine your name.
Some of you activists have been in danger for a long time, and you have prepared for the final blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Chercasov, a very old friend of Mymorial.
I'll tell you a little later, as usual, with Sasha saying good-bye.
Others are cultural actors, artists, critics, writers, impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: except for a very few of you -- those who worked in the Memorial, the New newspaper, the Echo of Moscow, the Medzie, the Navelin organization, and other places -- how many of you have done anything to counter this regime?
Except to participate in the rallyings while they were still there.
Also read a column of a Russian journalist, "It's too late to keep quiet."
And if you do, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not simply abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-term indifference to what's going on around you, by your apathy and your passiveness, which now must have been a great burden on your soul and heart?
That wasn't always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you had some freedom and democracy – even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is every time you finally have a revolution, you're in so much fear of sorrow that you're looking for salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel as if he's safer.
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of taking over and publishing the KGB archives, like the Germans did with the Stasi, you put your soul in the Derginsky Memorial, and let the KGB get to the bottom, update, reform and take over the country.
When you were put before a choice between national robbery and the return of Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, marking the end of mass rallying for great social justice or for war in Chechnya.
Survival was a major concern.
And then Putin came along, he's young, he's entrepreneurial, he's aggressive, he's promised to take away the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya again with earth, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember well those years.
It was when I was working in Chechnya to help the victims of the country's "anti-terrorism operation," and I saw with my eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes I went back to Moscow on weekends and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We were drinking, dancing, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murder of children killed, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Bold, we're sick of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
And I said, "Look, guys, this isn't my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your power to bomb one of your cities, kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of the zero, driven by the rising oil prices and the willingness of Putin to see through his fingers that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made a lot of money, some money, and even the poorest of you have acquired new housing and found a better job.
Prices grew, but was that disaster?
Mosk was holy, and luxuriant by the neck.
When some of the oppositioners were killed – Yuri Szczykzykzyna, Anne Politekowski, Alexander Litwinka and others – many of you were shocked and terrorized about what was going on.
Still, the matter was not going on.
When Putin was given the office of President Medvedev after two terms, and took the prime minister himself, you almost paid attention to it.
When, after months of Medvedev's reign, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or talked about it.
How many of you have I met in the years that followed on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbes or in the cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to say that it's not likely that we in the West have done much if we've done anything at all.
A little resentment, a little bit of sanction; but what was the significance of Russia’s gross violation of international law when Russia’s oil, gas and domestic market temptation so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important thing.
But at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, woke up.
When Putin again changed places with Medvedev and sat the president's chair as before, many of you decided it was too much, and you came out to protest massively.
The name of Navell became known, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt that it was losing the ground under its feet.
Then he struck back.
Alternative actions were initially organized, and more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were in prison.
Some have received huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Disaggregated by the pro - Russian president, who had undermined their European expectations, they once captured Maydan – and never left him.
They built a tent town of their own and prepared for a firm defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to defend him by means of sticks, armatures, and cocktails of Molotov.
The police finally opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protestors came to attack.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitive became Yanukovich, and the Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and expel them if they do not do well.
It was Putin who didn't like him very much.
That was a bad example.
So he took advantage of the sum, he took over the Crimea.
Some of you were opposed, but that was not good enough.
How many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91 percent of Russia's citizens supported the annex.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his wife - in - law suddenly returned 180 degrees Fahrenheit [180 ° C] and began to idolize him.
I find it hard to find a reason, since we stopped associating right after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you went to books, movies, ICEA catalogs, and parks, like new ones, after the restoration that Moscow started in 2012 -- with their bins, the public waifa and hipster cafes.
Indeed, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful — and only better.
You hardly paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, weren't there?
Ideal or whatever... even a Moscow editor who released my book on Syria, criticized it then in an interview because I didn't really understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I saw myself on the streets of Homs, state snipers shooting cold-bloodedly in my children's peers.
Only your soldiers who began to bomb thousands of civilians in 2015 were there among Russia's citizens, as they gained experience for the next serious war.
True, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemler:
"Now they came for socialists, but I said, "Because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came in trade unions, but I said, "Because I'm not a union member."
Then they came for the Jews, but I said, "Because I'm not a Jew."
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense."
How many of you have been talking about nuns, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority spoke.
Some people are really talking right now – like Demetr Glukhowski, Michael Schishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osypov, and others.
Most allow themselves to talk from abroad, some from within the country, like Marina Osnonikov, risking getting into the new GULAG or making a company called the Nwalinian.
In the case of others, you know the best way to live in the land you live in.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin gets out of Ukraine – or what seems very likely to happen if he doesn't, he'll take over.
For all of you, my friends, for those who were brave, but most of the time in private, there's still little time left, but soon you're going to get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who spoke dissension in social media (not even a black square in Instagram) or who spoke in private conversation with colleagues at work.
At times when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation of liberty were given simply for anecdote, they were left behind in the distant past — and now, with great probability, they are waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – is frightening to the Putti regime: they prove that they can fight it.
And that intelligence, motivation, and bravery can stop it, no matter how oppressive its advantage is.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize it, as well as the fact that war is going on.
But you, my friends, know exactly what's going on right now.
You are reading mobile news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you have contact.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be alert.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence is nearing its end.
Your election is just a homie, your laws, if you don't mind the repressive, you're worth no more than the paper on which they're written, your final free media is gone, your economy is being ruined faster than I am writing, you don't have credit cards anymore to buy a plane abroad, even if there's no flight left.
Now Putin will not be content with your silence; he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try it or go or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you're seeing another option.
Still, there's another one left.
Which will end up breaking this regime.
And maybe under the fold, you'll need less than you think.
Think about it.
It's not going to blow up on you because of the economic collapse coming from Russia, it's probably going to get wrapped up in the provinces, in the small cities.
When prices take off and the wages are not paid, people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, so you, my friends.
But if every city goes to a rally in itself, as it has been on a periodic basis, it will not be difficult to suppress it alone.
The required organization and coordination will be required; the crowd will have to be turned into mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool, the Internet, that can restrict, but it still works, and it can be done under almost any circumstances.
The organization of the Navelin was broken down, but it was possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
There are so many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly hundreds of thousands.
If it's over 300,000, it's going to be shocked.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when they get to work?
After everything, what did he make them go through in Ukraine, all he had to do?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will feel a sense of fear: but those who have children will fear them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid of you, too.
For the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare not neglect their host, who dare not only to demand freedom but really try to gain freedom.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke at the chat room of a computer game, and he will be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the Internet – and he will be arrested; your dear friend will make mistakes – and die in a raw cell under the police oaks.
This is what's been going on for many years, and it's going to just get bigger and bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice, if you don't do anything, you know what it's going to end.
Act coldly, think strategicly, and achieve that as a reality.
We were working Friday, we were told we could come on Monday.
We'll be home for tonight.
What You Think of Me as a Secretary's Press
Age, how often do you go to a expensive restaurant?
I go to dinner at the expensive restaurant once a week.
I'll try to explain everything to her.)
So we enjoyed it very well and we wanted something cooler, so this is a better option.
I was in a place where there were a lot of people, and I was very nervous.
I don't feel well, cough, temperature, loss of voice, weakness, and head revolve
I have to go to that government of work.
We've already done this, but we've been told who registered in April, get the money just at the end of the month.
Thursday needs a break, we go to the doctor's office with the kids.
But at night, I was writing to a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her, and I'm sure I'll report it.
As I worked in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, intellectual job in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a very bad time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I’ve been very friendly, yet I’ve also taken the matter of marriage seriously.
There was a man I was supposed to marry, but he died, a heart problem.
I think people should love, respect, trust each other to create a family.
At the moment, I haven't met that kind of thing.
Good morning, where can you get your mouthsticks or your silhouette?
Okay, thank you for the advice. I'll give a witness to Valya in the questionnaire.
She's got a MDP in a lying state, she's got a leg broken in the plaster, a gauze in a lying position, food is all digested in the blender.
Mr. Reihard, I'm sorry to bother you at a non-work time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went into the game room today in Natalie, to say hello to her.
She was in a bad situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said she was coming to watch things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valérie opened our children's room until 7:00 last night.
Could that really be the case?
The working time of the room is until 4:00.
And it's eventually our responsibility.
But I don't have a load that doesn't open a page that's very weak by the Internet.
Hi, we're all good. We're working well, we've got calls yesterday, and I've been doing an exam with the seniors before I go to gym.
It's the hardest thing to do to get rid of the geometry.
On Saturday, Vladimir helped us.
Vica is studying universities and programs at a high school.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We Are Thankful for Our Housing
Yeah, but I thought you weren't full.
We're going to get the best sum up to the end of the week to count.
